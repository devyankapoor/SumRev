Service is outstanding. The employees are so attentive and seem to really love their jobs. Food it also outstanding and some of the best I have had in Montreal. I will say the food is really heavy and I don't want to think about the fat and calories. You'll probably walk out having eaten 2000 calories and well over 50 grams of fat, per person. Then again, if you really care about that stuff, subways right around the corner. Treat yourself, check it out. You will not be disappointed.We came to celebrate my husband's birthday. We reserved via email. It's the easiest way. I highly recommend reserving this way. I do not recommend going on Sunday's. They're out of everything. They were out of a few items. I didn't care for some, but being out of Ribs, Sweetbread, and BEER?! That was very disappointing. I ended up getting the famous Duck in a Can. Great flavour. Very delicious. Duck cooked to perfection. Then the Ragout. I liked the texture and how all the ingredients complimented each other, but it was wayyy too salty. I loved how it was prepared in a cheese block in front of us. Our waitress was rude and short with everything. Uninformative. We felt very rushed by her. Pretty much everything sucked but the Duck in a Can. I will come back and perhaps the experience will be better to tie with the good food.One of the best restaurants I have ever been to (if not the best).I had the duck in a can and my friend the risotto.The risotto is mixed in inside a large parmeggiano cheesw block and the duck is cooked inside the can for 27 minutes to a perfect taste.What an experienceService was great too!!Ouff getting a reservation at au PdeC was not an easy task ... who still operates over voicemail? Especially over a voicemail box that is always full?!But au PdeC still seems to get away with it thanks to all the hype Anthony Bourdain created during his 24 hour Montreal layover (if you've never watched it: dailymotion.com/.../xo2k…...).Needless to say, we had to try it out ourselves or we couldn't be called true Montrealers. But the overwhelming foie gras stuffed courses were too much for two people to handle, so we brought 2 friends for back up! All in all, if you come knowing that this will not be a fine dining experience and that you WILL be overindulging in rich and heavy courses, then your experience will be a satisfying one. And let's be honest, everything just tastes better with fat!From the foie gras stuffed croquettes that just ooze in your mouth as you bite into them, to the decadent poutine topped with foie gras gravy and a whole piece of foie gras and then the squash risotto cooked in a whole wheel of parmesan...! Your reward center will be firing away happy signals for hours to come smile emoticonAll this goodness, paired with a nice bottle of french wine (they have an extensive french heavy wine list and some good beer on tap) made this a highly enjoyable 'tourist in your own city experience'. Good food, good wine and great company along with a surprisingly affordable tab... what's not to like?Heard lots of great reviews for Au Pied de Cochon. This restaurant was featured on one of the shows by Anthony Bourdain! Service was excellent.DRINKS:Pied de Cochon beer x 2TERRAINE OF FOIE GRAS (4/5)Came with jam and bread. So delicious - it's pure foie gras. The taste is very strong and flavourful. A must for foie gras lovers :) I actually enjoyed this dish better without adding the jam on my slice of bread.FOIE GRAS POUTINE (5/5)A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! The closer you are to Montreal, the better the poutine gets and this one is a 5-star poutine for sure! Large slices of foie gras and big chunks of cheese.. mm fatty good!DUCK IN A CAN (5/5)So creative! It's a mini show when the waiter comes over and open the can in front of us (I recorded it all haha). The duck meat was tender and juicy - delicious. I would order this again the next time I visit Au Pied de Cochon.This place is the epitome of French Canadian cuisine. If you want an authentic Canadian culinary experience then this is not to be missed. The food is not for the faint of hearts and definitely leave your vegetarian friends at home. I wouldn't say this is a good everyday-go-to kinda restaurant so come here when you have visitors from out of town or for a special occasion. On to our meal. After cleansing our palettes with foie gras croquettes, we were ready for our main event. We bravely ordered the whole pig's head for two and I can say that it has been one of my most memorable meals. The head of pig was roasted to glistening perfection. Paired with apple and root veggies, the whole plate was full of flavour and tender juicy porky deliciousness. Since they have an open kitchen, people took pictures of our food as it made its way towards our table. It was quite the show! Have to admit I couldn't eat pork for a couple of weeks after but it was definitely worth every bite. Eating at Au Pied is a special event you don't want to miss.Do you love ducks? Or better yet, do you hate ducks? To the point where you'll eat ducks in every form for 3 different dishes? If so, Au Pied de Cochon is just what the doctor ordered.Sure, the name translates to the pig's feet, but the duck is where it's at.Foie gras poutine is about as rich and delicious as it sounds.The duck in a can (which COMES WITH FOIE GRAS) is also a must. Just watching the waiter take a can opener to it and drop it onto a plate is a thing of beauty. The entire can is boiled and then brought out. All the spices are infused and all the fattiness is preserved without getting boiled off. Super unique. Just don't overdo it. One can is probably enough for 3-4 people unless you REALLY want to feel unhealthy.We also got a side of duck fat fries, because WHY THE HELL NOT?There were 8 of us, so we did a few other entrees as well. One was the PDC's cut, which the waiter told us was a boneless pork chop (there was a bone). It looked dry, but it was actually incredibly moist. It was a gigantic hunk of meat too.We also did one of the specials - the Ahi tuna steak for two. Let me tell you, it was NOT for two. Maybe if you fasted and that was the only thing you ate that day. But it was also good. Perfectly rare, with a ton of veggies and cheese on the side. It was probably our least favorite of the dishes, but even still, it was very well done.We were seated all the way in the back by the wine cellar, so it was a bit of a tight squeeze (especially with another large group next to us), but there wasn't much else to complain about. They also have one hell of a wine list.Our waiter was super cool and gave us shots to round out the night.Probably one of the best meals I've ever had. Also, why I came back to the States with none of pants fitting anymore.Make reservations! Either call/email or reserve online. It's a must. Also come hungry, because, they serve a lot of food.This place gets super packed during the dinner rush. Even dining at the counter gets full.I'd recommend the foie gras duo to get the best out of APC. If you're dining with friends, then I'm sure you can taste each other's food. But for a single diner like myself, the foie gras duo comes with Foie Gras burger and foie gras poutine fries. Huge portions for about $50. Very fatty, very rich, and very good.I started off with the tuna tartare as an appetizer, but even though it is a small portion, I couldn't get through my foie gras duo because of the enormity of the portions. The tuna tartare was tarty and fresh.And I still wanted dessert after and I chose the toffee maple milk shake. They made it right in front me...I guess because I was in the counter, but you can see all the fatty goodness when they make this. Not to sweet, but I had enough room to finish it. I would order this again.Trying to find street parking might be hard for you during dinner time. And the metro station is several blocks away. You can probably try the bixi bikes if you have time to roam around this part of the Montreal neighborhood.Drip Drip Drip4 star for food and service but -0.5 star for all the water dripping from the vent on top of my head all through my dinner.Drip Drip Dip I know it was one of the hottest weekend in Montreal. It was end of July after all and I should be thankful for the nice cool interior of the restaurant with their AC on full blast. But with the water dripping on me the whole time (2 hour) while I was enjoying my dinner was not cool. The staff was all trying their best to stop the dripping from top of the AC vent which ran across the full depth of the restaurant by a squeegee sponge but it was not working....Drip Drip DripDinner was really good!! Excellent!We shared Tarragon Bison Tongue ($8.50) - I just love the Cornichon in that! And now I have a bottle in my fridge at home!Pâté de Campagne ($9) - So smooth and rich!Duck Carpaccio ($14) - Well seasoned, my first time having duck carpaccioDuck in a Can ($44) - So overhyped! The duck was dry and just not good! Foie Gras was so so. I don't believe I said that but I preferred mine seared...Braised Pig Feet with Side Pasta ($50) Seasonal - Must Order!! It was so tender and flavoured!! And the pasta which was prepared table side was so good! Perfect al dente and with BACON... Drip Drip DripI would have up my star to a 4 because the food was just amazing and the service was excellent. But the management really need to do something about their cooling system. I definitely would be back! PS The reservation system just got so much better as my reservation was confirmed by email and no need to play phone tag again!We had the foie gras poutine, stuffed pied de cochon with foie gras and a tuna dish. All were very rich in flavor and will lead to a heart attack BUT worth every bite. Poutine- get it! after all it is a Canadian dishStuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras- this is large enough for 3-4 people to share, the best part about this dish was the MASHED POTATO, it is sooooooooo good! it has a different texture from the typical mushy mashed potato. Tuna dish- our waiter picked this for us so I don't know what it's called but it's a pretty good dish with gravy and mashed potato on the bottom but it was a little salty though. Overall, amazing FATTY French Canadian food.Very rich food. If you like your food too creamy or too buttery, then this is your type of food. Everything was just very heavy and I couldn't seem to finish the dish. The FG is actually not bad as this was my first time tasting it. Definitely not something I would typically eat but at least I tried it! Plogue Champlain $29Pork filet $30Fg hamburger $39Squash risotto $24Fg poutine $24Eel tart $14The place was jam packed and there's absolutely no room to move if you're sitting on the outside of the table. Service is slow because of how busy it is. Might take you 10min to get the attention of a waitress and another 10 for the bill. Overall definitely a place to try but not something I would do again as its not really my type of food fare.I am judging overall as a meal and the service. First off, the place doesnt have a banner so it is difficult to spot if you dont know where it is. Foie gras poutine. Very good, the foie gras melted in with the poutine and you were able to taste the foie gras. The texture or the plate was consistant, there was cheesy, crispy and then the foie gras made it very good. you were able to taste that the fries were fried in the duck fat and the gravy was creamy and rich. with that being said, a very good dish but will get heavy and sickening after you eat too much of it.Foie gras a la champlain. foie gras on top of a thick slice of bacon, on a bed of thin crispy potato pancake (like a thin hashbrown), topped with a generous amount of maple syrup sauce. First bite was veryyyyy good!! So cripsy from the potato, the bacon was thick and the foie gras was enhanced in this plate, the maple syrup sauce was a good amount of sweet and salty. But this is definitely not a plate you eat on your own, its best for sharing because after a while the taste and maple syrup is quite overwhelming. table side Squash risotto. risotto was cooked very well but since it was table side she made it in the a large parmesan cheese, mixed it all together. She over poured the chicken broth and the risotto became a soup. The waiter asked how it was and I told him honestly that I did not like it because it was too watery. He left then about 3-4 mins later he asked me "do you want me to take it to the chef to try it", well no obviously not! She should have known when she served it because it was clearly too watery. He knew I was unhappy and he was the one that was pushing for this squash risotto, he didnt do anything to make up for the bad dish. At a resto like that I would expect so much more. Overall, theres definitely better. I'm glad I tried it but I would not be returning.We made the reservation two weeks ago. Probably because it's weekday, we are the only customers at 5:00pm.We didn't drink alcohol, only a bottle of water. The water is in glass bottle, taste better than thesame brand in plastic bottle.Tarragon Bison Tongue is the first dish. The tongue is from beef. Mr. Tang said it's good. I prefer the pickle, since I didn't try the tongue.Catch of the day, we picked the smoked eel. It also served with a piece of veal bone, you can eat the marrow(not sure if it's this word...).Fg poutine is great, although foie gras is too greasy for me.The duck in a can is great too. The duck is juicy and fresh, also with blood. The veggie taste a bit sour, really savory.The one missing star is for the dessert. Both icecream and pecan pie are too sweet for me to enjoy.After much hype, I made it here with a few colleagues on a Wednesday evening. The place was absolutely hopping and hard to get into, but we made a reservation a few weeks in advance.Once inside we sat at the bar, which is by far the best seat in the house. It comes with a direct view of the kitchen and all the goodness the chefs are whipping up. We started out with the ham special for appetizer, which was delicious. It came with a baguette and butter which made it perfect. We then had some poutine, which was also quite good. It was definitely better quality than most poutine dishes. For the main course, I went aggressive and got a mixed bowl consisting of blood sausage, pork sausage, mushrooms and onions sitting on top of mashed potatoes. The dish was very good, but not the amazing experience I was hoping for. Spices could have been a little better, but make no mistake it was a very good dish.With its popular reputation, upbeat atmosphere and good food, this is definitely a place worth visiting when in town. They also have a really good bar with interesting drinks. Great overall experience.Delicious food and a must if you're in Montreal. Come in hungry bc you'll get a rich and hearty meal. We ordered the infamous duck in a can, mushroom tortellini (tonites special), the steamed dumplings & plogue a Champlain "foie gras breakfast" - which was the highlight of the night. buckwheat pancake,  thick Canadian bacon, potatoes and cheese topped with foie gras. I wish it was one of the earlier items delivered I would have enjoyed a few more bites. Would def come here with a group to be able to taste more items on the menu. It's a busy restaurant so do make reservations. We scored 9:30 pm reservations on a Sunday night and place was packed with ppl still coming in with reservations after us. Service was slow and we had a really long wait b/t entrees coming out. We didn't leave until after 11:30. Luckily for us, our toddler was still on California time and was cooperative.Visit Montreal for a weekend and made a reservation two weeks in advance. Not too hard: I left a voicemail and someone called me back the next day. Between my friend and I, we ordered:- cromesquis de foie gras, basically deep fried fg. For $4, it was worth it. - temaki tartare, tartare Japanese hand roll. They didn't have bison available and we were offered veal. I quite enjoyed the layers of flavour and texture. - carpaccio de canard, duck carpaccio. My second favorite of the night. - and finally, poutine au foie gras. I hate to say it but this was a bit of a disappointment. I'm a fan of fg but this didn't have the ah-ha for me. We went later in the evening and 2 of the 3 cocktails were already sold out. My reco would be to go early. We also had a lot of trouble finding this place late at night. You really have to know what the front looks like!If you love pork and foie gras, this place is heaven. Recommend getting the foie gras poutine and the duck in a can. We also ordered the onion soup, duck carpaccio and the dumplings.Onion soup - your standard cheesy onion soup done right. Super tasty. Foie gras Poutine - must get!! Abundance of extra buttery and fatty foie gras with fries and gravy. This is a heavy dish so great for sharing and having a cold beer. Duck carpaccio - the presentation of the dish was beautiful. Thinly slice duck with chives, raw mushrooms and a yolk. Duck in a can - must get as well! The waiter brings over the can and opens it in front of the table. The content of the can contains the small duck, foie gras, cabbage which is all poured over the bread with carrot purée. The meat was tender and succulent.The service was very good - our waiter was extremely nice and helpful in making suggestions. There are so many options to choose from so it's great if you come with a big group and share everything!This place is insanely delicious.  The restaurant is a bit tight on space but the kitchen is opened. You can actually hear the staff call out orders.  There are so many options that we probably over ordered for two people!! For starters, we had poutine with foie gras, duck carpaccio and beef tongue.  For entrees we had the duck in a can and the blood sausage tart.  The duck in the can was amazing! We totally over did it on the foie gras but you only live once! We had so much foodWe had to call ahead so the restaurant could accommodate our baby.I went with a southern French person to this restaurant but he did not completely agree with my assessment. Just a caveat. :-)We really wanted to try a Montreal special, as this place is very well known. This place has the famous foie gras poutine and Duck in a Can. We decided to all share to try a few more dishes. The baguette is good!The ambience is nice. We went right when it opened and there was a small line waiting. You cannot get seated if you have not made a reservation. Plan ahead. 1. Garden salad: not on the menu, but we figured we were having so many animal parts this was probably a good idea. $15 for generic salad. The salad was fresh but basic. 2. Mushroom risotto: this dish is very expensive for what it is, but you get a show. They come to your table with a large cheese bowl and add the risotto, mushroom, and even Canadian bacon. This dish had potential but was much too salty. It was hard to finish. 3. Terragon Bison tongue: this is tongue well done. The texture is very soft, which is impressive given the quality of most tongues. The sauces and everything just work well together. However, it's game-y so just be warned. 4. Foie gras poutine: loved it. The fries were good. The gravy was also good. The foie gras was in large blocks and was nice and fatty. I think if you come here, you should get this dish! 5. Duck in a Can: I loved watching them pour half a duck out of a can. Life experience. It even looked nice coming out. The duck came out as a thick filet attached to a flap of lard and also fatty liver (foie gras). I enjoyed this dish very much. It was over puréed cauliflower. The issue I had was that the duck meat was very thick. I had to eat it with slices of the lard to complement the taste. Overall a good dish. 6. Dessert: we got the maple cake and the lemon pie. Both were pretty good. Get the maple cake for novelty sake! Very sweet but good flavors. It was a pricy meal, but for a specialty restaurant it made sense.When my friend and I were certain we wanted to try Au Pied de Cochon, I tried to make reservation (1 week in advance) but their voicemail box was full... I didn't know what to do except, trying to call in the following days... And finally, 2 days before the date we wanted to go, I was finally able to make a reservation (but there weren't any tables left, and the lady asked me if it was okay to be seated at the counter/bar, which I was fine with).Being seated at the counter/bar was actually one exciting experience since we were able to watch the chefs cook and take a glance at all the dishes other customers ordered! It was really mind-blowing watching them cook in a fast-moving environment! I really liked their open-kitchen. It was also fun to guess whether the dish was ours or not too (it was our first time at Au Pied de Cochon, so we didn't know what to expect!)Before coming to Au Pied de Cochon, I searched other people's reviews and made my mind that I wanted to try their Duck in a Can! And this was one of the two dishes we ordered. We didn't know what to order next and my friend thought the The PDC Melting Pot has an interesting name, so we ordered that! Our waiter served us bread and butter (we didn't eat a lot since we wanted to save the tummy for our main courses, but the bread was not too hard, it was perfect!)Duck in a Can: Ordered it like I said because a lot of reviews said it is a must there! It is without doubt an interesting and fun dish. It came in a heated can (like how the name of the dish suggested). So, the waiter brought it over and opened it in front of you, poured the content out of the can (which contains the duck breast, 100g of foie gras, cabbages, the sauce) over the bread with carrot and cauliflower purée. The meat was really tender and it went very well with the cabbage, especially when you eat it with a small piece of duck meat. I actually really like the cabbage! It balanced the richness of the duck meat and foie gras very well. The fat under the duck meat was so chewy (I like chewy stuff) but the other fat part was.... I didn't like it since it was too greasy but some people like the feeling of fat melting in the mouth. We finished the dish (expect for the fat part) since it was too much for us.Duck in a can was quite an experience to be honest, it might not be my favorite dish due to its richness and especially oiliness but it was definitely an unique and interesting experience due to the presentation of the dish in a can!PDC Melting Pot:We actually preferred the melting pot because the taste wasn't as heavy as Duck in a Can and the pot was full of surprises, which made it more interesting. This dish came in a pot which was already hinted with its name! There was pork sausages, shiitake mushrooms, buttery potato cheese which was like mashed potatoes with cheese at the bottom, blood sausage -boudin but it is not like the Asian style one-, pork belly (so yummy!), pork loin and onions. There were a lot of things inside the pot; a lots of surprises! I absolutely loved the "buttery potato cheese", it was so delicious and well-made! The pork was tender and everything in this pot went extremely well with the mashed potatoes! The onion sauce was perfect too! It was a rich dish but not overwhelming like Duck in a Can.We also ordered their Milkshake XXX. My thought of my first sip: this is quite sweet... But afterwards, it got better! I don't know what was inside this milkshake... It tasted like rum (I'm not sure if it contained alcohol though). This was one rich milkshake I would say!We were basically in a food coma after this! I would definitely like to come back again and try their bison tongue (saw good reviews about it!)P.S: Make sure to make a reservation!!! Keep on trying even when their voicemail box is full!Service is outstanding. The employees are so attentive and seem to really love their jobs. Food it also outstanding and some of the best I have had in Montreal. I will say the food is really heavy and I don't want to think about the fat and calories. You'll probably walk out having eaten 2000 calories and well over 50 grams of fat, per person. Then again, if you really care about that stuff, subways right around the corner.

All were very rich in flavor and will lead to a heart attack BUT worth every bite. Poutine- get it! after all it is a Canadian dishStuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras- this is large enough for 3-4 people to share, the best part about this dish was the MASHED POTATO, it is sooooooooo good! it has a different texture from the typical mushy mashed potato. Tuna dish- our waiter picked this for us so I don't know what it's called but it's a pretty good dish with gravy and mashed potato on the bottom but it was a little salty though. Overall, amazing FATTY French Canadian food.Very rich food. If you like your food too creamy or too buttery, then this is your type of food. Everything was just very heavy and I couldn't seem to finish the dish. The FG is actually not bad as this was my first time tasting it. Definitely not something I would typically eat but at least I tried it! Plogue Champlain $29Pork filet $30Fg hamburger $39Squash risotto $24Fg poutine $24Eel tart $14The place was jam packed and there's absolutely no room to move if you're sitting on the outside of the table. Service is slow because of how busy it is. Might take you 10min to get the attention of a waitress and another 10 for the bill. Overall definitely a place to try but not something I would do again as its not really my type of food fare.I am judging overall as a meal and the service. First off, the place doesnt have a banner so it is difficult to spot if you dont know where it is. Foie gras poutine. Very good, the foie gras melted in with the poutine and you were able to taste the foie gras. The texture or the plate was consistant, there was cheesy, crispy and then the foie gras made it very good. you were able to taste that the fries were fried in the duck fat and the gravy was creamy and rich. with that being said, a very good dish but will get heavy and sickening after you eat too much of it.Foie gras a la champlain. foie gras on top of a thick slice of bacon, on a bed of thin crispy potato pancake (like a thin hashbrown), topped with a generous amount of maple syrup sauce. First bite was veryyyyy good!! So cripsy from the potato, the bacon was thick and the foie gras was enhanced in this plate, the maple syrup sauce was a good amount of sweet and salty. But this is definitely not a plate you eat on your own, its best for sharing because after a while the taste and maple syrup is quite overwhelming. table side Squash risotto. risotto was cooked very well but since it was table side she made it in the a large parmesan cheese, mixed it all together. She over poured the chicken broth and the risotto became a soup. The waiter asked how it was and I told him honestly that I did not like it because it was too watery. He left then about 3-4 mins later he asked me "do you want me to take it to the chef to try it", well no obviously not! She should have known when she served it because it was clearly too watery. He knew I was unhappy and he was the one that was pushing for this squash risotto, he didnt do anything to make up for the bad dish. At a resto like that I would expect so much more. Overall, theres definitely better. I'm glad I tried it but I would not be returning.We made the reservation two weeks ago. Probably because it's weekday, we are the only customers at 5:00pm.We didn't drink alcohol, only a bottle of water. The water is in glass bottle, taste better than thesame brand in plastic bottle.Tarragon Bison Tongue is the first dish. The tongue is from beef. Mr. Tang said it's good. I prefer the pickle, since I didn't try the tongue.Catch of the day, we picked the smoked eel. It also served with a piece of veal bone, you can eat the marrow(not sure if it's this word...).Fg poutine is great, although foie gras is too greasy for me.The duck in a can is great too. The duck is juicy and fresh, also with blood. The veggie taste a bit sour, really savory.The one missing star is for the dessert. Both icecream and pecan pie are too sweet for me to enjoy.After much hype, I made it here with a few colleagues on a Wednesday evening. The place was absolutely hopping and hard to get into, but we made a reservation a few weeks in advance.Once inside we sat at the bar, which is by far the best seat in the house. It comes with a direct view of the kitchen and all the goodness the chefs are whipping up. We started out with the ham special for appetizer, which was delicious. It came with a baguette and butter which made it perfect. We then had some poutine, which was also quite good. It was definitely better quality than most poutine dishes. For the main course, I went aggressive and got a mixed bowl consisting of blood sausage, pork sausage, mushrooms and onions sitting on top of mashed potatoes. The dish was very good, but not the amazing experience I was hoping for. Spices could have been a little better, but make no mistake it was a very good dish.With its popular reputation, upbeat atmosphere and good food, this is definitely a place worth visiting when in town. They also have a really good bar with interesting drinks. Great overall experience.Delicious food and a must if you're in Montreal. Come in hungry bc you'll get a rich and hearty meal. We ordered the infamous duck in a can, mushroom tortellini (tonites special), the steamed dumplings & plogue a Champlain "foie gras breakfast" - which was the highlight of the night. buckwheat pancake,  thick Canadian bacon, potatoes and cheese topped with foie gras. I wish it was one of the earlier items delivered I would have enjoyed a few more bites. Would def come here with a group to be able to taste more items on the menu. It's a busy restaurant so do make reservations. We scored 9:30 pm reservations on a Sunday night and place was packed with ppl still coming in with reservations after us. Service was slow and we had a really long wait b/t entrees coming out. We didn't leave until after 11:30. Luckily for us, our toddler was still on California time and was cooperative.Visit Montreal for a weekend and made a reservation two weeks in advance. Not too hard: I left a voicemail and someone called me back the next day. Between my friend and I, we ordered:- cromesquis de foie gras, basically deep fried fg. For $4, it was worth it. - temaki tartare, tartare Japanese hand roll. They didn't have bison available and we were offered veal. I quite enjoyed the layers of flavour and texture. - carpaccio de canard, duck carpaccio. My second favorite of the night. - and finally, poutine au foie gras. I hate to say it but this was a bit of a disappointment. I'm a fan of fg but this didn't have the ah-ha for me. We went later in the evening and 2 of the 3 cocktails were already sold out. My reco would be to go early. We also had a lot of trouble finding this place late at night. You really have to know what the front looks like!If you love pork and foie gras, this place is heaven. Recommend getting the foie gras poutine and the duck in a can. We also ordered the onion soup, duck carpaccio and the dumplings.Onion soup - your standard cheesy onion soup done right. Super tasty. Foie gras Poutine - must get!! Abundance of extra buttery and fatty foie gras with fries and gravy. This is a heavy dish so great for sharing and having a cold beer. Duck carpaccio - the presentation of the dish was beautiful. Thinly slice duck with chives, raw mushrooms and a yolk. Duck in a can - must get as well! The waiter brings over the can and opens it in front of the table. The content of the can contains the small duck, foie gras, cabbage which is all poured over the bread with carrot purée. The meat was tender and succulent.The service was very good - our waiter was extremely nice and helpful in making suggestions. There are so many options to choose from so it's great if you come with a big group and share everything!This place is insanely delicious.  The restaurant is a bit tight on space but the kitchen is opened. You can actually hear the staff call out orders.  There are so many options that we probably over ordered for two people!! For starters, we had poutine with foie gras, duck carpaccio and beef tongue.  For entrees we had the duck in a can and the blood sausage tart.  The duck in the can was amazing! We totally over did it on the foie gras but you only live once! We had so much foodWe had to call ahead so the restaurant could accommodate our baby.I went with a southern French person to this restaurant but he did not completely agree with my assessment. Just a caveat. :-)We really wanted to try a Montreal special, as this place is very well known. This place has the famous foie gras poutine and Duck in a Can. We decided to all share to try a few more dishes. The baguette is good!The ambience is nice. We went right when it opened and there was a small line waiting. You cannot get seated if you have not made a reservation. Plan ahead. 1. Garden salad: not on the menu, but we figured we were having so many animal parts this was probably a good idea. $15 for generic salad. The salad was fresh but basic. 2. Mushroom risotto: this dish is very expensive for what it is, but you get a show. They come to your table with a large cheese bowl and add the risotto, mushroom, and even Canadian bacon. This dish had potential but was much too salty. It was hard to finish. 3. Terragon Bison tongue: this is tongue well done. The texture is very soft, which is impressive given the quality of most tongues. The sauces and everything just work well together. However, it's game-y so just be warned. 4. Foie gras poutine: loved it. The fries were good. The gravy was also good. The foie gras was in large blocks and was nice and fatty. I think if you come here, you should get this dish! 5. Duck in a Can: I loved watching them pour half a duck out of a can. Life experience. It even looked nice coming out. The duck came out as a thick filet attached to a flap of lard and also fatty liver (foie gras). I enjoyed this dish very much. It was over puréed cauliflower. The issue I had was that the duck meat was very thick. I had to eat it with slices of the lard to complement the taste. Overall a good dish. 6. Dessert: we got the maple cake and the lemon pie. Both were pretty good. Get the maple cake for novelty sake! Very sweet but good flavors. It was a pricy meal, but for a specialty restaurant it made sense.When my friend and I were certain we wanted to try Au Pied de Cochon, I tried to make reservation (1 week in advance) but their voicemail box was full... I didn't know what to do except, trying to call in the following days... And finally, 2 days before the date we wanted to go, I was finally able to make a reservation (but there weren't any tables left, and the lady asked me if it was okay to be seated at the counter/bar, which I was fine with).Being seated at the counter/bar was actually one exciting experience since we were able to watch the chefs cook and take a glance at all the dishes other customers ordered! It was really mind-blowing watching them cook in a fast-moving environment! I really liked their open-kitchen. It was also fun to guess whether the dish was ours or not too (it was our first time at Au Pied de Cochon, so we didn't know what to expect!)Before coming to Au Pied de Cochon, I searched other people's reviews and made my mind that I wanted to try their Duck in a Can! And this was one of the two dishes we ordered. We didn't know what to order next and my friend thought the The PDC Melting Pot has an interesting name, so we ordered that! Our waiter served us bread and butter (we didn't eat a lot since we wanted to save the tummy for our main courses, but the bread was not too hard, it was perfect!)Duck in a Can: Ordered it like I said because a lot of reviews said it is a must there! It is without doubt an interesting and fun dish. It came in a heated can (like how the name of the dish suggested). So, the waiter brought it over and opened it in front of you, poured the content out of the can (which contains the duck breast, 100g of foie gras, cabbages, the sauce) over the bread with carrot and cauliflower purée. The meat was really tender and it went very well with the cabbage, especially when you eat it with a small piece of duck meat. I actually really like the cabbage! It balanced the richness of the duck meat and foie gras very well. The fat under the duck meat was so chewy (I like chewy stuff) but the other fat part was.... I didn't like it since it was too greasy but some people like the feeling of fat melting in the mouth. We finished the dish (expect for the fat part) since it was too much for us.Duck in a can was quite an experience to be honest, it might not be my favorite dish due to its richness and especially oiliness but it was definitely an unique and interesting experience due to the presentation of the dish in a can!PDC Melting Pot:We actually preferred the melting pot because the taste wasn't as heavy as Duck in a Can and the pot was full of surprises, which made it more interesting. This dish came in a pot which was already hinted with its name! There was pork sausages, shiitake mushrooms, buttery potato cheese which was like mashed potatoes with cheese at the bottom, blood sausage -boudin but it is not like the Asian style one-, pork belly (so yummy!), pork loin and onions. There were a lot of things inside the pot; a lots of surprises! I absolutely loved the "buttery potato cheese", it was so delicious and well-made! The pork was tender and everything in this pot went extremely well with the mashed potatoes! The onion sauce was perfect too! It was a rich dish but not overwhelming like Duck in a Can.We also ordered their Milkshake XXX. My thought of my first sip: this is quite sweet... But afterwards, it got better! I don't know what was inside this milkshake... It tasted like rum (I'm not sure if it contained alcohol though). This was one rich milkshake I would say!We were basically in a food coma after this! I would definitely like to come back again and try their bison tongue (saw good reviews about it!)P.S: Make sure to make a reservation!!! Keep on trying even when their voicemail box is full!Service is outstanding. The employees are so attentive and seem to really love their jobs. Food it also outstanding and some of the best I have had in Montreal. I will say the food is really heavy and I don't want to think about the fat and calories. You'll probably walk out having eaten 2000 calories and well over 50 grams of fat, per person. Then again, if you really care about that stuff, subways right around the corner. Treat yourself, check it out. You will not be disappointed.We came to celebrate my husband's birthday. We reserved via email. It's the easiest way. I highly recommend reserving this way. I do not recommend going on Sunday's. They're out of everything. They were out of a few items. I didn't care for some, but being out of Ribs, Sweetbread, and BEER?! That was very disappointing. I ended up getting the famous Duck in a Can. Great flavour. Very delicious. Duck cooked to perfection. Then the Ragout. I liked the texture and how all the ingredients complimented each other, but it was wayyy too salty. I loved how it was prepared in a cheese block in front of us. Our waitress was rude and short with everything. Uninformative. We felt very rushed by her. Pretty much everything sucked but the Duck in a Can. I will come back and perhaps the experience will be better to tie with the good food.One of the best restaurants I have ever been to (if not the best).I had the duck in a can and my friend the risotto.The risotto is mixed in inside a large parmeggiano cheesw block and the duck is cooked inside the can for 27 minutes to a perfect taste.What an experienceService was great too!!Ouff getting a reservation at au PdeC was not an easy task ... who still operates over voicemail? Especially over a voicemail box that is always full?!But au PdeC still seems to get away with it thanks to all the hype Anthony Bourdain created during his 24 hour Montreal layover (if you've never watched it: dailymotion.com/.../xo2k…...).Needless to say, we had to try it out ourselves or we couldn't be called true Montrealers. But the overwhelming foie gras stuffed courses were too much for two people to handle, so we brought 2 friends for back up! All in all, if you come knowing that this will not be a fine dining experience and that you WILL be overindulging in rich and heavy courses, then your experience will be a satisfying one. And let's be honest, everything just tastes better with fat!From the foie gras stuffed croquettes that just ooze in your mouth as you bite into them, to the decadent poutine topped with foie gras gravy and a whole piece of foie gras and then the squash risotto cooked in a whole wheel of parmesan...! Your reward center will be firing away happy signals for hours to come smile emoticonAll this goodness, paired with a nice bottle of french wine (they have an extensive french heavy wine list and some good beer on tap) made this a highly enjoyable 'tourist in your own city experience'. Good food, good wine and great company along with a surprisingly affordable tab... what's not to like?Heard lots of great reviews for Au Pied de Cochon. This restaurant was featured on one of the shows by Anthony Bourdain! Service was excellent.DRINKS:Pied de Cochon beer x 2TERRAINE OF FOIE GRAS (4/5)Came with jam and bread. So delicious - it's pure foie gras. The taste is very strong and flavourful. A must for foie gras lovers :) I actually enjoyed this dish better without adding the jam on my slice of bread.FOIE GRAS POUTINE (5/5)A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! The closer you are to Montreal, the better the poutine gets and this one is a 5-star poutine for sure! Large slices of foie gras and big chunks of cheese.. mm fatty good!DUCK IN A CAN (5/5)So creative! It's a mini show when the waiter comes over and open the can in front of us (I recorded it all haha). The duck meat was tender and juicy - delicious. I would order this again the next time I visit Au Pied de Cochon.This place is the epitome of French Canadian cuisine. If you want an authentic Canadian culinary experience then this is not to be missed. The food is not for the faint of hearts and definitely leave your vegetarian friends at home. I wouldn't say this is a good everyday-go-to kinda restaurant so come here when you have visitors from out of town or for a special occasion. On to our meal. After cleansing our palettes with foie gras croquettes, we were ready for our main event. We bravely ordered the whole pig's head for two and I can say that it has been one of my most memorable meals. The head of pig was roasted to glistening perfection. Paired with apple and root veggies, the whole plate was full of flavour and tender juicy porky deliciousness. Since they have an open kitchen, people took pictures of our food as it made its way towards our table. It was quite the show! Have to admit I couldn't eat pork for a couple of weeks after but it was definitely worth every bite. Eating at Au Pied is a special event you don't want to miss.Do you love ducks? Or better yet, do you hate ducks? To the point where you'll eat ducks in every form for 3 different dishes? If so, Au Pied de Cochon is just what the doctor ordered.Sure, the name translates to the pig's feet, but the duck is where it's at.Foie gras poutine is about as rich and delicious as it sounds.The duck in a can (which COMES WITH FOIE GRAS) is also a must. Just watching the waiter take a can opener to it and drop it onto a plate is a thing of beauty. The entire can is boiled and then brought out. All the spices are infused and all the fattiness is preserved without getting boiled off. Super unique. Just don't overdo it. One can is probably enough for 3-4 people unless you REALLY want to feel unhealthy.We also got a side of duck fat fries, because WHY THE HELL NOT?There were 8 of us, so we did a few other entrees as well. One was the PDC's cut, which the waiter told us was a boneless pork chop (there was a bone). It looked dry, but it was actually incredibly moist. It was a gigantic hunk of meat too.We also did one of the specials - the Ahi tuna steak for two. Let me tell you, it was NOT for two. Maybe if you fasted and that was the only thing you ate that day. But it was also good. Perfectly rare, with a ton of veggies and cheese on the side. It was probably our least favorite of the dishes, but even still, it was very well done.We were seated all the way in the back by the wine cellar, so it was a bit of a tight squeeze (especially with another large group next to us), but there wasn't much else to complain about. They also have one hell of a wine list.Our waiter was super cool and gave us shots to round out the night.Probably one of the best meals I've ever had. Also, why I came back to the States with none of pants fitting anymore.Make reservations! Either call/email or reserve online. It's a must. Also come hungry, because, they serve a lot of food.This place gets super packed during the dinner rush. Even dining at the counter gets full.I'd recommend the foie gras duo to get the best out of APC. If you're dining with friends, then I'm sure you can taste each other's food. But for a single diner like myself, the foie gras duo comes with Foie Gras burger and foie gras poutine fries. Huge portions for about $50. Very fatty, very rich, and very good.I started off with the tuna tartare as an appetizer, but even though it is a small portion, I couldn't get through my foie gras duo because of the enormity of the portions. The tuna tartare was tarty and fresh.And I still wanted dessert after and I chose the toffee maple milk shake. They made it right in front me...I guess because I was in the counter, but you can see all the fatty goodness when they make this. Not to sweet, but I had enough room to finish it. I would order this again.Trying to find street parking might be hard for you during dinner time. And the metro station is several blocks away. You can probably try the bixi bikes if you have time to roam around this part of the Montreal neighborhood.Drip Drip Drip4 star for food and service but -0.5 star for all the water dripping from the vent on top of my head all through my dinner.Drip Drip Dip I know it was one of the hottest weekend in Montreal. It was end of July after all and I should be thankful for the nice cool interior of the restaurant with their AC on full blast. But with the water dripping on me the whole time (2 hour) while I was enjoying my dinner was not cool. The staff was all trying their best to stop the dripping from top of the AC vent which ran across the full depth of the restaurant by a squeegee sponge but it was not working....Drip Drip DripDinner was really good!! Excellent!We shared Tarragon Bison Tongue ($8.50) - I just love the Cornichon in that! And now I have a bottle in my fridge at home!Pâté de Campagne ($9) - So smooth and rich!Duck Carpaccio ($14) - Well seasoned, my first time having duck carpaccioDuck in a Can ($44) - So overhyped! The duck was dry and just not good! Foie Gras was so so. I don't believe I said that but I preferred mine seared...Braised Pig Feet with Side Pasta ($50) Seasonal - Must Order!! It was so tender and flavoured!! And the pasta which was prepared table side was so good! Perfect al dente and with BACON... Drip Drip DripI would have up my star to a 4 because the food was just amazing and the service was excellent. But the management really need to do something about their cooling system. I definitely would be back! PS The reservation system just got so much better as my reservation was confirmed by email and no need to play phone tag again!We had the foie gras poutine, stuffed pied de cochon with foie gras and a tuna dish.

Foie gras poutine: loved it. The fries were good. The gravy was also good. The foie gras was in large blocks and was nice and fatty. I think if you come here, you should get this dish! 5. Duck in a Can: I loved watching them pour half a duck out of a can. Life experience. It even looked nice coming out. The duck came out as a thick filet attached to a flap of lard and also fatty liver (foie gras). I enjoyed this dish very much. It was over puréed cauliflower. The issue I had was that the duck meat was very thick. I had to eat it with slices of the lard to complement the taste. Overall a good dish. 6. Dessert: we got the maple cake and the lemon pie. Both were pretty good. Get the maple cake for novelty sake! Very sweet but good flavors. It was a pricy meal, but for a specialty restaurant it made sense.When my friend and I were certain we wanted to try Au Pied de Cochon, I tried to make reservation (1 week in advance) but their voicemail box was full... I didn't know what to do except, trying to call in the following days... And finally, 2 days before the date we wanted to go, I was finally able to make a reservation (but there weren't any tables left, and the lady asked me if it was okay to be seated at the counter/bar, which I was fine with).Being seated at the counter/bar was actually one exciting experience since we were able to watch the chefs cook and take a glance at all the dishes other customers ordered! It was really mind-blowing watching them cook in a fast-moving environment! I really liked their open-kitchen. It was also fun to guess whether the dish was ours or not too (it was our first time at Au Pied de Cochon, so we didn't know what to expect!)Before coming to Au Pied de Cochon, I searched other people's reviews and made my mind that I wanted to try their Duck in a Can! And this was one of the two dishes we ordered. We didn't know what to order next and my friend thought the The PDC Melting Pot has an interesting name, so we ordered that! Our waiter served us bread and butter (we didn't eat a lot since we wanted to save the tummy for our main courses, but the bread was not too hard, it was perfect!)Duck in a Can: Ordered it like I said because a lot of reviews said it is a must there! It is without doubt an interesting and fun dish. It came in a heated can (like how the name of the dish suggested). So, the waiter brought it over and opened it in front of you, poured the content out of the can (which contains the duck breast, 100g of foie gras, cabbages, the sauce) over the bread with carrot and cauliflower purée. The meat was really tender and it went very well with the cabbage, especially when you eat it with a small piece of duck meat. I actually really like the cabbage! It balanced the richness of the duck meat and foie gras very well. The fat under the duck meat was so chewy (I like chewy stuff) but the other fat part was.... I didn't like it since it was too greasy but some people like the feeling of fat melting in the mouth. We finished the dish (expect for the fat part) since it was too much for us.Duck in a can was quite an experience to be honest, it might not be my favorite dish due to its richness and especially oiliness but it was definitely an unique and interesting experience due to the presentation of the dish in a can!PDC Melting Pot:We actually preferred the melting pot because the taste wasn't as heavy as Duck in a Can and the pot was full of surprises, which made it more interesting. This dish came in a pot which was already hinted with its name! There was pork sausages, shiitake mushrooms, buttery potato cheese which was like mashed potatoes with cheese at the bottom, blood sausage -boudin but it is not like the Asian style one-, pork belly (so yummy!), pork loin and onions. There were a lot of things inside the pot; a lots of surprises! I absolutely loved the "buttery potato cheese", it was so delicious and well-made! The pork was tender and everything in this pot went extremely well with the mashed potatoes! The onion sauce was perfect too! It was a rich dish but not overwhelming like Duck in a Can.We also ordered their Milkshake XXX. My thought of my first sip: this is quite sweet... But afterwards, it got better! I don't know what was inside this milkshake... It tasted like rum (I'm not sure if it contained alcohol though). This was one rich milkshake I would say!We were basically in a food coma after this! I would definitely like to come back again and try their bison tongue (saw good reviews about it!)P.S: Make sure to make a reservation!!! Keep on trying even when their voicemail box is full!Service is outstanding. The employees are so attentive and seem to really love their jobs. Food it also outstanding and some of the best I have had in Montreal. I will say the food is really heavy and I don't want to think about the fat and calories. You'll probably walk out having eaten 2000 calories and well over 50 grams of fat, per person. Then again, if you really care about that stuff, subways right around the corner. Treat yourself, check it out. You will not be disappointed.We came to celebrate my husband's birthday. We reserved via email. It's the easiest way. I highly recommend reserving this way. I do not recommend going on Sunday's. They're out of everything. They were out of a few items. I didn't care for some, but being out of Ribs, Sweetbread, and BEER?! That was very disappointing. I ended up getting the famous Duck in a Can. Great flavour. Very delicious. Duck cooked to perfection. Then the Ragout. I liked the texture and how all the ingredients complimented each other, but it was wayyy too salty. I loved how it was prepared in a cheese block in front of us. Our waitress was rude and short with everything. Uninformative. We felt very rushed by her. Pretty much everything sucked but the Duck in a Can. I will come back and perhaps the experience will be better to tie with the good food.One of the best restaurants I have ever been to (if not the best).I had the duck in a can and my friend the risotto.The risotto is mixed in inside a large parmeggiano cheesw block and the duck is cooked inside the can for 27 minutes to a perfect taste.What an experienceService was great too!!Ouff getting a reservation at au PdeC was not an easy task ... who still operates over voicemail? Especially over a voicemail box that is always full?!But au PdeC still seems to get away with it thanks to all the hype Anthony Bourdain created during his 24 hour Montreal layover (if you've never watched it: dailymotion.com/.../xo2k…...).Needless to say, we had to try it out ourselves or we couldn't be called true Montrealers. But the overwhelming foie gras stuffed courses were too much for two people to handle, so we brought 2 friends for back up! All in all, if you come knowing that this will not be a fine dining experience and that you WILL be overindulging in rich and heavy courses, then your experience will be a satisfying one. And let's be honest, everything just tastes better with fat!From the foie gras stuffed croquettes that just ooze in your mouth as you bite into them, to the decadent poutine topped with foie gras gravy and a whole piece of foie gras and then the squash risotto cooked in a whole wheel of parmesan...! Your reward center will be firing away happy signals for hours to come smile emoticonAll this goodness, paired with a nice bottle of french wine (they have an extensive french heavy wine list and some good beer on tap) made this a highly enjoyable 'tourist in your own city experience'. Good food, good wine and great company along with a surprisingly affordable tab... what's not to like?Heard lots of great reviews for Au Pied de Cochon. This restaurant was featured on one of the shows by Anthony Bourdain! Service was excellent.DRINKS:Pied de Cochon beer x 2TERRAINE OF FOIE GRAS (4/5)Came with jam and bread. So delicious - it's pure foie gras. The taste is very strong and flavourful. A must for foie gras lovers :) I actually enjoyed this dish better without adding the jam on my slice of bread.FOIE GRAS POUTINE (5/5)A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! The closer you are to Montreal, the better the poutine gets and this one is a 5-star poutine for sure! Large slices of foie gras and big chunks of cheese.. mm fatty good!DUCK IN A CAN (5/5)So creative! It's a mini show when the waiter comes over and open the can in front of us (I recorded it all haha). The duck meat was tender and juicy - delicious. I would order this again the next time I visit Au Pied de Cochon.This place is the epitome of French Canadian cuisine. If you want an authentic Canadian culinary experience then this is not to be missed. The food is not for the faint of hearts and definitely leave your vegetarian friends at home. I wouldn't say this is a good everyday-go-to kinda restaurant so come here when you have visitors from out of town or for a special occasion. On to our meal. After cleansing our palettes with foie gras croquettes, we were ready for our main event. We bravely ordered the whole pig's head for two and I can say that it has been one of my most memorable meals. The head of pig was roasted to glistening perfection. Paired with apple and root veggies, the whole plate was full of flavour and tender juicy porky deliciousness. Since they have an open kitchen, people took pictures of our food as it made its way towards our table. It was quite the show! Have to admit I couldn't eat pork for a couple of weeks after but it was definitely worth every bite. Eating at Au Pied is a special event you don't want to miss.Do you love ducks? Or better yet, do you hate ducks? To the point where you'll eat ducks in every form for 3 different dishes? If so, Au Pied de Cochon is just what the doctor ordered.Sure, the name translates to the pig's feet, but the duck is where it's at.Foie gras poutine is about as rich and delicious as it sounds.The duck in a can (which COMES WITH FOIE GRAS) is also a must. Just watching the waiter take a can opener to it and drop it onto a plate is a thing of beauty. The entire can is boiled and then brought out. All the spices are infused and all the fattiness is preserved without getting boiled off. Super unique. Just don't overdo it. One can is probably enough for 3-4 people unless you REALLY want to feel unhealthy.We also got a side of duck fat fries, because WHY THE HELL NOT?There were 8 of us, so we did a few other entrees as well. One was the PDC's cut, which the waiter told us was a boneless pork chop (there was a bone). It looked dry, but it was actually incredibly moist. It was a gigantic hunk of meat too.We also did one of the specials - the Ahi tuna steak for two. Let me tell you, it was NOT for two. Maybe if you fasted and that was the only thing you ate that day. But it was also good. Perfectly rare, with a ton of veggies and cheese on the side. It was probably our least favorite of the dishes, but even still, it was very well done.We were seated all the way in the back by the wine cellar, so it was a bit of a tight squeeze (especially with another large group next to us), but there wasn't much else to complain about. They also have one hell of a wine list.Our waiter was super cool and gave us shots to round out the night.Probably one of the best meals I've ever had. Also, why I came back to the States with none of pants fitting anymore.Make reservations! Either call/email or reserve online. It's a must. Also come hungry, because, they serve a lot of food.This place gets super packed during the dinner rush. Even dining at the counter gets full.I'd recommend the foie gras duo to get the best out of APC. If you're dining with friends, then I'm sure you can taste each other's food. But for a single diner like myself, the foie gras duo comes with Foie Gras burger and foie gras poutine fries. Huge portions for about $50. Very fatty, very rich, and very good.I started off with the tuna tartare as an appetizer, but even though it is a small portion, I couldn't get through my foie gras duo because of the enormity of the portions. The tuna tartare was tarty and fresh.And I still wanted dessert after and I chose the toffee maple milk shake. They made it right in front me...I guess because I was in the counter, but you can see all the fatty goodness when they make this. Not to sweet, but I had enough room to finish it. I would order this again.Trying to find street parking might be hard for you during dinner time. And the metro station is several blocks away. You can probably try the bixi bikes if you have time to roam around this part of the Montreal neighborhood.Drip Drip Drip4 star for food and service but -0.5 star for all the water dripping from the vent on top of my head all through my dinner.Drip Drip Dip I know it was one of the hottest weekend in Montreal. It was end of July after all and I should be thankful for the nice cool interior of the restaurant with their AC on full blast. But with the water dripping on me the whole time (2 hour) while I was enjoying my dinner was not cool. The staff was all trying their best to stop the dripping from top of the AC vent which ran across the full depth of the restaurant by a squeegee sponge but it was not working....Drip Drip DripDinner was really good!! Excellent!We shared Tarragon Bison Tongue ($8.50) - I just love the Cornichon in that! And now I have a bottle in my fridge at home!Pâté de Campagne ($9) - So smooth and rich!Duck Carpaccio ($14) - Well seasoned, my first time having duck carpaccioDuck in a Can ($44) - So overhyped! The duck was dry and just not good! Foie Gras was so so. I don't believe I said that but I preferred mine seared...Braised Pig Feet with Side Pasta ($50) Seasonal - Must Order!! It was so tender and flavoured!! And the pasta which was prepared table side was so good! Perfect al dente and with BACON... Drip Drip DripI would have up my star to a 4 because the food was just amazing and the service was excellent. But the management really need to do something about their cooling system. I definitely would be back! PS The reservation system just got so much better as my reservation was confirmed by email and no need to play phone tag again!We had the foie gras poutine, stuffed pied de cochon with foie gras and a tuna dish. All were very rich in flavor and will lead to a heart attack BUT worth every bite. Poutine- get it! after all it is a Canadian dishStuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras- this is large enough for 3-4 people to share, the best part about this dish was the MASHED POTATO, it is sooooooooo good! it has a different texture from the typical mushy mashed potato. Tuna dish- our waiter picked this for us so I don't know what it's called but it's a pretty good dish with gravy and mashed potato on the bottom but it was a little salty though. Overall, amazing FATTY French Canadian food.Very rich food. If you like your food too creamy or too buttery, then this is your type of food. Everything was just very heavy and I couldn't seem to finish the dish. The FG is actually not bad as this was my first time tasting it. Definitely not something I would typically eat but at least I tried it! Plogue Champlain $29Pork filet $30Fg hamburger $39Squash risotto $24Fg poutine $24Eel tart $14The place was jam packed and there's absolutely no room to move if you're sitting on the outside of the table. Service is slow because of how busy it is. Might take you 10min to get the attention of a waitress and another 10 for the bill. Overall definitely a place to try but not something I would do again as its not really my type of food fare.I am judging overall as a meal and the service. First off, the place doesnt have a banner so it is difficult to spot if you dont know where it is. Foie gras poutine. Very good, the foie gras melted in with the poutine and you were able to taste the foie gras. The texture or the plate was consistant, there was cheesy, crispy and then the foie gras made it very good. you were able to taste that the fries were fried in the duck fat and the gravy was creamy and rich. with that being said, a very good dish but will get heavy and sickening after you eat too much of it.Foie gras a la champlain. foie gras on top of a thick slice of bacon, on a bed of thin crispy potato pancake (like a thin hashbrown), topped with a generous amount of maple syrup sauce. First bite was veryyyyy good!! So cripsy from the potato, the bacon was thick and the foie gras was enhanced in this plate, the maple syrup sauce was a good amount of sweet and salty. But this is definitely not a plate you eat on your own, its best for sharing because after a while the taste and maple syrup is quite overwhelming. table side Squash risotto. risotto was cooked very well but since it was table side she made it in the a large parmesan cheese, mixed it all together. She over poured the chicken broth and the risotto became a soup. The waiter asked how it was and I told him honestly that I did not like it because it was too watery. He left then about 3-4 mins later he asked me "do you want me to take it to the chef to try it", well no obviously not! She should have known when she served it because it was clearly too watery. He knew I was unhappy and he was the one that was pushing for this squash risotto, he didnt do anything to make up for the bad dish. At a resto like that I would expect so much more. Overall, theres definitely better. I'm glad I tried it but I would not be returning.We made the reservation two weeks ago. Probably because it's weekday, we are the only customers at 5:00pm.We didn't drink alcohol, only a bottle of water. The water is in glass bottle, taste better than thesame brand in plastic bottle.Tarragon Bison Tongue is the first dish. The tongue is from beef. Mr. Tang said it's good. I prefer the pickle, since I didn't try the tongue.Catch of the day, we picked the smoked eel. It also served with a piece of veal bone, you can eat the marrow(not sure if it's this word...).Fg poutine is great, although foie gras is too greasy for me.The duck in a can is great too. The duck is juicy and fresh, also with blood. The veggie taste a bit sour, really savory.The one missing star is for the dessert. Both icecream and pecan pie are too sweet for me to enjoy.After much hype, I made it here with a few colleagues on a Wednesday evening. The place was absolutely hopping and hard to get into, but we made a reservation a few weeks in advance.Once inside we sat at the bar, which is by far the best seat in the house. It comes with a direct view of the kitchen and all the goodness the chefs are whipping up. We started out with the ham special for appetizer, which was delicious. It came with a baguette and butter which made it perfect. We then had some poutine, which was also quite good. It was definitely better quality than most poutine dishes. For the main course, I went aggressive and got a mixed bowl consisting of blood sausage, pork sausage, mushrooms and onions sitting on top of mashed potatoes. The dish was very good, but not the amazing experience I was hoping for. Spices could have been a little better, but make no mistake it was a very good dish.With its popular reputation, upbeat atmosphere and good food, this is definitely a place worth visiting when in town. They also have a really good bar with interesting drinks. Great overall experience.Delicious food and a must if you're in Montreal. Come in hungry bc you'll get a rich and hearty meal. We ordered the infamous duck in a can, mushroom tortellini (tonites special), the steamed dumplings & plogue a Champlain "foie gras breakfast" - which was the highlight of the night. buckwheat pancake,  thick Canadian bacon, potatoes and cheese topped with foie gras. I wish it was one of the earlier items delivered I would have enjoyed a few more bites. Would def come here with a group to be able to taste more items on the menu. It's a busy restaurant so do make reservations. We scored 9:30 pm reservations on a Sunday night and place was packed with ppl still coming in with reservations after us. Service was slow and we had a really long wait b/t entrees coming out. We didn't leave until after 11:30. Luckily for us, our toddler was still on California time and was cooperative.Visit Montreal for a weekend and made a reservation two weeks in advance. Not too hard: I left a voicemail and someone called me back the next day. Between my friend and I, we ordered:- cromesquis de foie gras, basically deep fried fg. For $4, it was worth it. - temaki tartare, tartare Japanese hand roll. They didn't have bison available and we were offered veal. I quite enjoyed the layers of flavour and texture. - carpaccio de canard, duck carpaccio. My second favorite of the night. - and finally, poutine au foie gras. I hate to say it but this was a bit of a disappointment. I'm a fan of fg but this didn't have the ah-ha for me. We went later in the evening and 2 of the 3 cocktails were already sold out. My reco would be to go early. We also had a lot of trouble finding this place late at night. You really have to know what the front looks like!If you love pork and foie gras, this place is heaven. Recommend getting the foie gras poutine and the duck in a can. We also ordered the onion soup, duck carpaccio and the dumplings.Onion soup - your standard cheesy onion soup done right. Super tasty. Foie gras Poutine - must get!! Abundance of extra buttery and fatty foie gras with fries and gravy. This is a heavy dish so great for sharing and having a cold beer. Duck carpaccio - the presentation of the dish was beautiful. Thinly slice duck with chives, raw mushrooms and a yolk. Duck in a can - must get as well! The waiter brings over the can and opens it in front of the table. The content of the can contains the small duck, foie gras, cabbage which is all poured over the bread with carrot purée. The meat was tender and succulent.The service was very good - our waiter was extremely nice and helpful in making suggestions. There are so many options to choose from so it's great if you come with a big group and share everything!This place is insanely delicious.  The restaurant is a bit tight on space but the kitchen is opened. You can actually hear the staff call out orders.  There are so many options that we probably over ordered for two people!! For starters, we had poutine with foie gras, duck carpaccio and beef tongue.  For entrees we had the duck in a can and the blood sausage tart.  The duck in the can was amazing! We totally over did it on the foie gras but you only live once! We had so much foodWe had to call ahead so the restaurant could accommodate our baby.I went with a southern French person to this restaurant but he did not completely agree with my assessment. Just a caveat. :-)We really wanted to try a Montreal special, as this place is very well known. This place has the famous foie gras poutine and Duck in a Can. We decided to all share to try a few more dishes. The baguette is good!The ambience is nice. We went right when it opened and there was a small line waiting. You cannot get seated if you have not made a reservation. Plan ahead. 1. Garden salad: not on the menu, but we figured we were having so many animal parts this was probably a good idea. $15 for generic salad. The salad was fresh but basic. 2. Mushroom risotto: this dish is very expensive for what it is, but you get a show. They come to your table with a large cheese bowl and add the risotto, mushroom, and even Canadian bacon. This dish had potential but was much too salty. It was hard to finish. 3. Terragon Bison tongue: this is tongue well done. The texture is very soft, which is impressive given the quality of most tongues. The sauces and everything just work well together. However, it's game-y so just be warned. 4. Foie gras poutine: loved it. The fries were good. The gravy was also good. The foie gras was in large blocks and was nice and fatty. I think if you come here, you should get this dish! 5. Duck in a Can: I loved watching them pour half a duck out of a can. Life experience. It even looked nice coming out. The duck came out as a thick filet attached to a flap of lard and also fatty liver (foie gras). I enjoyed this dish very much. It was over puréed cauliflower. The issue I had was that the duck meat was very thick. I had to eat it with slices of the lard to complement the taste. Overall a good dish. 6. Dessert: we got the maple cake and the lemon pie. Both were pretty good. Get the maple cake for novelty sake! Very sweet but good flavors.

Or better yet, do you hate ducks? To the point where you'll eat ducks in every form for 3 different dishes? If so, Au Pied de Cochon is just what the doctor ordered.Sure, the name translates to the pig's feet, but the duck is where it's at.Foie gras poutine is about as rich and delicious as it sounds.The duck in a can (which COMES WITH FOIE GRAS) is also a must. Just watching the waiter take a can opener to it and drop it onto a plate is a thing of beauty. The entire can is boiled and then brought out. All the spices are infused and all the fattiness is preserved without getting boiled off. Super unique. Just don't overdo it. One can is probably enough for 3-4 people unless you REALLY want to feel unhealthy.We also got a side of duck fat fries, because WHY THE HELL NOT?There were 8 of us, so we did a few other entrees as well. One was the PDC's cut, which the waiter told us was a boneless pork chop (there was a bone). It looked dry, but it was actually incredibly moist. It was a gigantic hunk of meat too.We also did one of the specials - the Ahi tuna steak for two. Let me tell you, it was NOT for two. Maybe if you fasted and that was the only thing you ate that day. But it was also good. Perfectly rare, with a ton of veggies and cheese on the side. It was probably our least favorite of the dishes, but even still, it was very well done.We were seated all the way in the back by the wine cellar, so it was a bit of a tight squeeze (especially with another large group next to us), but there wasn't much else to complain about. They also have one hell of a wine list.Our waiter was super cool and gave us shots to round out the night.Probably one of the best meals I've ever had. Also, why I came back to the States with none of pants fitting anymore.Make reservations! Either call/email or reserve online. It's a must. Also come hungry, because, they serve a lot of food.This place gets super packed during the dinner rush. Even dining at the counter gets full.I'd recommend the foie gras duo to get the best out of APC. If you're dining with friends, then I'm sure you can taste each other's food. But for a single diner like myself, the foie gras duo comes with Foie Gras burger and foie gras poutine fries. Huge portions for about $50. Very fatty, very rich, and very good.I started off with the tuna tartare as an appetizer, but even though it is a small portion, I couldn't get through my foie gras duo because of the enormity of the portions. The tuna tartare was tarty and fresh.And I still wanted dessert after and I chose the toffee maple milk shake. They made it right in front me...I guess because I was in the counter, but you can see all the fatty goodness when they make this. Not to sweet, but I had enough room to finish it. I would order this again.Trying to find street parking might be hard for you during dinner time. And the metro station is several blocks away. You can probably try the bixi bikes if you have time to roam around this part of the Montreal neighborhood.Drip Drip Drip4 star for food and service but -0.5 star for all the water dripping from the vent on top of my head all through my dinner.Drip Drip Dip I know it was one of the hottest weekend in Montreal. It was end of July after all and I should be thankful for the nice cool interior of the restaurant with their AC on full blast. But with the water dripping on me the whole time (2 hour) while I was enjoying my dinner was not cool. The staff was all trying their best to stop the dripping from top of the AC vent which ran across the full depth of the restaurant by a squeegee sponge but it was not working....Drip Drip DripDinner was really good!! Excellent!We shared Tarragon Bison Tongue ($8.50) - I just love the Cornichon in that! And now I have a bottle in my fridge at home!Pâté de Campagne ($9) - So smooth and rich!Duck Carpaccio ($14) - Well seasoned, my first time having duck carpaccioDuck in a Can ($44) - So overhyped! The duck was dry and just not good! Foie Gras was so so. I don't believe I said that but I preferred mine seared...Braised Pig Feet with Side Pasta ($50) Seasonal - Must Order!! It was so tender and flavoured!! And the pasta which was prepared table side was so good! Perfect al dente and with BACON... Drip Drip DripI would have up my star to a 4 because the food was just amazing and the service was excellent. But the management really need to do something about their cooling system. I definitely would be back! PS The reservation system just got so much better as my reservation was confirmed by email and no need to play phone tag again!We had the foie gras poutine, stuffed pied de cochon with foie gras and a tuna dish. All were very rich in flavor and will lead to a heart attack BUT worth every bite. Poutine- get it! after all it is a Canadian dishStuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras- this is large enough for 3-4 people to share, the best part about this dish was the MASHED POTATO, it is sooooooooo good! it has a different texture from the typical mushy mashed potato. Tuna dish- our waiter picked this for us so I don't know what it's called but it's a pretty good dish with gravy and mashed potato on the bottom but it was a little salty though. Overall, amazing FATTY French Canadian food.Very rich food. If you like your food too creamy or too buttery, then this is your type of food. Everything was just very heavy and I couldn't seem to finish the dish. The FG is actually not bad as this was my first time tasting it. Definitely not something I would typically eat but at least I tried it! Plogue Champlain $29Pork filet $30Fg hamburger $39Squash risotto $24Fg poutine $24Eel tart $14The place was jam packed and there's absolutely no room to move if you're sitting on the outside of the table. Service is slow because of how busy it is. Might take you 10min to get the attention of a waitress and another 10 for the bill. Overall definitely a place to try but not something I would do again as its not really my type of food fare.I am judging overall as a meal and the service. First off, the place doesnt have a banner so it is difficult to spot if you dont know where it is. Foie gras poutine. Very good, the foie gras melted in with the poutine and you were able to taste the foie gras. The texture or the plate was consistant, there was cheesy, crispy and then the foie gras made it very good. you were able to taste that the fries were fried in the duck fat and the gravy was creamy and rich. with that being said, a very good dish but will get heavy and sickening after you eat too much of it.Foie gras a la champlain. foie gras on top of a thick slice of bacon, on a bed of thin crispy potato pancake (like a thin hashbrown), topped with a generous amount of maple syrup sauce. First bite was veryyyyy good!! So cripsy from the potato, the bacon was thick and the foie gras was enhanced in this plate, the maple syrup sauce was a good amount of sweet and salty. But this is definitely not a plate you eat on your own, its best for sharing because after a while the taste and maple syrup is quite overwhelming. table side Squash risotto. risotto was cooked very well but since it was table side she made it in the a large parmesan cheese, mixed it all together. She over poured the chicken broth and the risotto became a soup. The waiter asked how it was and I told him honestly that I did not like it because it was too watery. He left then about 3-4 mins later he asked me "do you want me to take it to the chef to try it", well no obviously not! She should have known when she served it because it was clearly too watery. He knew I was unhappy and he was the one that was pushing for this squash risotto, he didnt do anything to make up for the bad dish. At a resto like that I would expect so much more. Overall, theres definitely better. I'm glad I tried it but I would not be returning.We made the reservation two weeks ago. Probably because it's weekday, we are the only customers at 5:00pm.We didn't drink alcohol, only a bottle of water. The water is in glass bottle, taste better than thesame brand in plastic bottle.Tarragon Bison Tongue is the first dish. The tongue is from beef. Mr. Tang said it's good. I prefer the pickle, since I didn't try the tongue.Catch of the day, we picked the smoked eel. It also served with a piece of veal bone, you can eat the marrow(not sure if it's this word...).Fg poutine is great, although foie gras is too greasy for me.The duck in a can is great too. The duck is juicy and fresh, also with blood. The veggie taste a bit sour, really savory.The one missing star is for the dessert. Both icecream and pecan pie are too sweet for me to enjoy.After much hype, I made it here with a few colleagues on a Wednesday evening. The place was absolutely hopping and hard to get into, but we made a reservation a few weeks in advance.Once inside we sat at the bar, which is by far the best seat in the house. It comes with a direct view of the kitchen and all the goodness the chefs are whipping up. We started out with the ham special for appetizer, which was delicious. It came with a baguette and butter which made it perfect. We then had some poutine, which was also quite good. It was definitely better quality than most poutine dishes. For the main course, I went aggressive and got a mixed bowl consisting of blood sausage, pork sausage, mushrooms and onions sitting on top of mashed potatoes. The dish was very good, but not the amazing experience I was hoping for. Spices could have been a little better, but make no mistake it was a very good dish.With its popular reputation, upbeat atmosphere and good food, this is definitely a place worth visiting when in town. They also have a really good bar with interesting drinks. Great overall experience.Delicious food and a must if you're in Montreal. Come in hungry bc you'll get a rich and hearty meal. We ordered the infamous duck in a can, mushroom tortellini (tonites special), the steamed dumplings & plogue a Champlain "foie gras breakfast" - which was the highlight of the night. buckwheat pancake,  thick Canadian bacon, potatoes and cheese topped with foie gras. I wish it was one of the earlier items delivered I would have enjoyed a few more bites. Would def come here with a group to be able to taste more items on the menu. It's a busy restaurant so do make reservations. We scored 9:30 pm reservations on a Sunday night and place was packed with ppl still coming in with reservations after us. Service was slow and we had a really long wait b/t entrees coming out. We didn't leave until after 11:30. Luckily for us, our toddler was still on California time and was cooperative.Visit Montreal for a weekend and made a reservation two weeks in advance. Not too hard: I left a voicemail and someone called me back the next day. Between my friend and I, we ordered:- cromesquis de foie gras, basically deep fried fg. For $4, it was worth it. - temaki tartare, tartare Japanese hand roll. They didn't have bison available and we were offered veal. I quite enjoyed the layers of flavour and texture. - carpaccio de canard, duck carpaccio. My second favorite of the night. - and finally, poutine au foie gras. I hate to say it but this was a bit of a disappointment. I'm a fan of fg but this didn't have the ah-ha for me. We went later in the evening and 2 of the 3 cocktails were already sold out. My reco would be to go early. We also had a lot of trouble finding this place late at night. You really have to know what the front looks like!If you love pork and foie gras, this place is heaven. Recommend getting the foie gras poutine and the duck in a can. We also ordered the onion soup, duck carpaccio and the dumplings.Onion soup - your standard cheesy onion soup done right. Super tasty. Foie gras Poutine - must get!! Abundance of extra buttery and fatty foie gras with fries and gravy. This is a heavy dish so great for sharing and having a cold beer. Duck carpaccio - the presentation of the dish was beautiful. Thinly slice duck with chives, raw mushrooms and a yolk. Duck in a can - must get as well! The waiter brings over the can and opens it in front of the table. The content of the can contains the small duck, foie gras, cabbage which is all poured over the bread with carrot purée. The meat was tender and succulent.The service was very good - our waiter was extremely nice and helpful in making suggestions. There are so many options to choose from so it's great if you come with a big group and share everything!This place is insanely delicious.  The restaurant is a bit tight on space but the kitchen is opened. You can actually hear the staff call out orders.  There are so many options that we probably over ordered for two people!! For starters, we had poutine with foie gras, duck carpaccio and beef tongue.  For entrees we had the duck in a can and the blood sausage tart.  The duck in the can was amazing! We totally over did it on the foie gras but you only live once! We had so much foodWe had to call ahead so the restaurant could accommodate our baby.I went with a southern French person to this restaurant but he did not completely agree with my assessment. Just a caveat. :-)We really wanted to try a Montreal special, as this place is very well known. This place has the famous foie gras poutine and Duck in a Can. We decided to all share to try a few more dishes. The baguette is good!The ambience is nice. We went right when it opened and there was a small line waiting. You cannot get seated if you have not made a reservation. Plan ahead. 1. Garden salad: not on the menu, but we figured we were having so many animal parts this was probably a good idea. $15 for generic salad. The salad was fresh but basic. 2. Mushroom risotto: this dish is very expensive for what it is, but you get a show. They come to your table with a large cheese bowl and add the risotto, mushroom, and even Canadian bacon. This dish had potential but was much too salty. It was hard to finish. 3. Terragon Bison tongue: this is tongue well done. The texture is very soft, which is impressive given the quality of most tongues. The sauces and everything just work well together. However, it's game-y so just be warned. 4. Foie gras poutine: loved it. The fries were good. The gravy was also good. The foie gras was in large blocks and was nice and fatty. I think if you come here, you should get this dish! 5. Duck in a Can: I loved watching them pour half a duck out of a can. Life experience. It even looked nice coming out. The duck came out as a thick filet attached to a flap of lard and also fatty liver (foie gras). I enjoyed this dish very much. It was over puréed cauliflower. The issue I had was that the duck meat was very thick. I had to eat it with slices of the lard to complement the taste. Overall a good dish. 6. Dessert: we got the maple cake and the lemon pie. Both were pretty good. Get the maple cake for novelty sake! Very sweet but good flavors. It was a pricy meal, but for a specialty restaurant it made sense.When my friend and I were certain we wanted to try Au Pied de Cochon, I tried to make reservation (1 week in advance) but their voicemail box was full... I didn't know what to do except, trying to call in the following days... And finally, 2 days before the date we wanted to go, I was finally able to make a reservation (but there weren't any tables left, and the lady asked me if it was okay to be seated at the counter/bar, which I was fine with).Being seated at the counter/bar was actually one exciting experience since we were able to watch the chefs cook and take a glance at all the dishes other customers ordered! It was really mind-blowing watching them cook in a fast-moving environment! I really liked their open-kitchen. It was also fun to guess whether the dish was ours or not too (it was our first time at Au Pied de Cochon, so we didn't know what to expect!)Before coming to Au Pied de Cochon, I searched other people's reviews and made my mind that I wanted to try their Duck in a Can! And this was one of the two dishes we ordered. We didn't know what to order next and my friend thought the The PDC Melting Pot has an interesting name, so we ordered that! Our waiter served us bread and butter (we didn't eat a lot since we wanted to save the tummy for our main courses, but the bread was not too hard, it was perfect!)Duck in a Can: Ordered it like I said because a lot of reviews said it is a must there! It is without doubt an interesting and fun dish. It came in a heated can (like how the name of the dish suggested). So, the waiter brought it over and opened it in front of you, poured the content out of the can (which contains the duck breast, 100g of foie gras, cabbages, the sauce) over the bread with carrot and cauliflower purée. The meat was really tender and it went very well with the cabbage, especially when you eat it with a small piece of duck meat. I actually really like the cabbage! It balanced the richness of the duck meat and foie gras very well. The fat under the duck meat was so chewy (I like chewy stuff) but the other fat part was.... I didn't like it since it was too greasy but some people like the feeling of fat melting in the mouth. We finished the dish (expect for the fat part) since it was too much for us.Duck in a can was quite an experience to be honest, it might not be my favorite dish due to its richness and especially oiliness but it was definitely an unique and interesting experience due to the presentation of the dish in a can!PDC Melting Pot:We actually preferred the melting pot because the taste wasn't as heavy as Duck in a Can and the pot was full of surprises, which made it more interesting. This dish came in a pot which was already hinted with its name! There was pork sausages, shiitake mushrooms, buttery potato cheese which was like mashed potatoes with cheese at the bottom, blood sausage -boudin but it is not like the Asian style one-, pork belly (so yummy!), pork loin and onions. There were a lot of things inside the pot; a lots of surprises! I absolutely loved the "buttery potato cheese", it was so delicious and well-made! The pork was tender and everything in this pot went extremely well with the mashed potatoes! The onion sauce was perfect too! It was a rich dish but not overwhelming like Duck in a Can.We also ordered their Milkshake XXX. My thought of my first sip: this is quite sweet... But afterwards, it got better! I don't know what was inside this milkshake... It tasted like rum (I'm not sure if it contained alcohol though). This was one rich milkshake I would say!We were basically in a food coma after this! I would definitely like to come back again and try their bison tongue (saw good reviews about it!)P.S: Make sure to make a reservation!!! Keep on trying even when their voicemail box is full!Service is outstanding. The employees are so attentive and seem to really love their jobs. Food it also outstanding and some of the best I have had in Montreal. I will say the food is really heavy and I don't want to think about the fat and calories. You'll probably walk out having eaten 2000 calories and well over 50 grams of fat, per person. Then again, if you really care about that stuff, subways right around the corner. Treat yourself, check it out. You will not be disappointed.We came to celebrate my husband's birthday. We reserved via email. It's the easiest way. I highly recommend reserving this way. I do not recommend going on Sunday's. They're out of everything. They were out of a few items. I didn't care for some, but being out of Ribs, Sweetbread, and BEER?! That was very disappointing. I ended up getting the famous Duck in a Can. Great flavour. Very delicious. Duck cooked to perfection. Then the Ragout. I liked the texture and how all the ingredients complimented each other, but it was wayyy too salty. I loved how it was prepared in a cheese block in front of us. Our waitress was rude and short with everything. Uninformative. We felt very rushed by her. Pretty much everything sucked but the Duck in a Can. I will come back and perhaps the experience will be better to tie with the good food.One of the best restaurants I have ever been to (if not the best).I had the duck in a can and my friend the risotto.The risotto is mixed in inside a large parmeggiano cheesw block and the duck is cooked inside the can for 27 minutes to a perfect taste.What an experienceService was great too!!Ouff getting a reservation at au PdeC was not an easy task ... who still operates over voicemail? Especially over a voicemail box that is always full?!But au PdeC still seems to get away with it thanks to all the hype Anthony Bourdain created during his 24 hour Montreal layover (if you've never watched it: dailymotion.com/.../xo2k…...).Needless to say, we had to try it out ourselves or we couldn't be called true Montrealers. But the overwhelming foie gras stuffed courses were too much for two people to handle, so we brought 2 friends for back up! All in all, if you come knowing that this will not be a fine dining experience and that you WILL be overindulging in rich and heavy courses, then your experience will be a satisfying one. And let's be honest, everything just tastes better with fat!From the foie gras stuffed croquettes that just ooze in your mouth as you bite into them, to the decadent poutine topped with foie gras gravy and a whole piece of foie gras and then the squash risotto cooked in a whole wheel of parmesan...! Your reward center will be firing away happy signals for hours to come smile emoticonAll this goodness, paired with a nice bottle of french wine (they have an extensive french heavy wine list and some good beer on tap) made this a highly enjoyable 'tourist in your own city experience'. Good food, good wine and great company along with a surprisingly affordable tab... what's not to like?Heard lots of great reviews for Au Pied de Cochon. This restaurant was featured on one of the shows by Anthony Bourdain! Service was excellent.DRINKS:Pied de Cochon beer x 2TERRAINE OF FOIE GRAS (4/5)Came with jam and bread. So delicious - it's pure foie gras. The taste is very strong and flavourful. A must for foie gras lovers :) I actually enjoyed this dish better without adding the jam on my slice of bread.FOIE GRAS POUTINE (5/5)A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! The closer you are to Montreal, the better the poutine gets and this one is a 5-star poutine for sure! Large slices of foie gras and big chunks of cheese.. mm fatty good!DUCK IN A CAN (5/5)So creative! It's a mini show when the waiter comes over and open the can in front of us (I recorded it all haha). The duck meat was tender and juicy - delicious. I would order this again the next time I visit Au Pied de Cochon.This place is the epitome of French Canadian cuisine. If you want an authentic Canadian culinary experience then this is not to be missed. The food is not for the faint of hearts and definitely leave your vegetarian friends at home. I wouldn't say this is a good everyday-go-to kinda restaurant so come here when you have visitors from out of town or for a special occasion. On to our meal. After cleansing our palettes with foie gras croquettes, we were ready for our main event. We bravely ordered the whole pig's head for two and I can say that it has been one of my most memorable meals. The head of pig was roasted to glistening perfection. Paired with apple and root veggies, the whole plate was full of flavour and tender juicy porky deliciousness. Since they have an open kitchen, people took pictures of our food as it made its way towards our table. It was quite the show! Have to admit I couldn't eat pork for a couple of weeks after but it was definitely worth every bite. Eating at Au Pied is a special event you don't want to miss.Do you love ducks? Or better yet, do you hate ducks? To the point where you'll eat ducks in every form for 3 different dishes?

For the main course, I went aggressive and got a mixed bowl consisting of blood sausage, pork sausage, mushrooms and onions sitting on top of mashed potatoes. The dish was very good, but not the amazing experience I was hoping for. Spices could have been a little better, but make no mistake it was a very good dish.With its popular reputation, upbeat atmosphere and good food, this is definitely a place worth visiting when in town. They also have a really good bar with interesting drinks. Great overall experience.Delicious food and a must if you're in Montreal. Come in hungry bc you'll get a rich and hearty meal. We ordered the infamous duck in a can, mushroom tortellini (tonites special), the steamed dumplings & plogue a Champlain "foie gras breakfast" - which was the highlight of the night. buckwheat pancake,  thick Canadian bacon, potatoes and cheese topped with foie gras. I wish it was one of the earlier items delivered I would have enjoyed a few more bites. Would def come here with a group to be able to taste more items on the menu. It's a busy restaurant so do make reservations. We scored 9:30 pm reservations on a Sunday night and place was packed with ppl still coming in with reservations after us. Service was slow and we had a really long wait b/t entrees coming out. We didn't leave until after 11:30. Luckily for us, our toddler was still on California time and was cooperative.Visit Montreal for a weekend and made a reservation two weeks in advance. Not too hard: I left a voicemail and someone called me back the next day. Between my friend and I, we ordered:- cromesquis de foie gras, basically deep fried fg. For $4, it was worth it. - temaki tartare, tartare Japanese hand roll. They didn't have bison available and we were offered veal. I quite enjoyed the layers of flavour and texture. - carpaccio de canard, duck carpaccio. My second favorite of the night. - and finally, poutine au foie gras. I hate to say it but this was a bit of a disappointment. I'm a fan of fg but this didn't have the ah-ha for me. We went later in the evening and 2 of the 3 cocktails were already sold out. My reco would be to go early. We also had a lot of trouble finding this place late at night. You really have to know what the front looks like!If you love pork and foie gras, this place is heaven. Recommend getting the foie gras poutine and the duck in a can. We also ordered the onion soup, duck carpaccio and the dumplings.Onion soup - your standard cheesy onion soup done right. Super tasty. Foie gras Poutine - must get!! Abundance of extra buttery and fatty foie gras with fries and gravy. This is a heavy dish so great for sharing and having a cold beer. Duck carpaccio - the presentation of the dish was beautiful. Thinly slice duck with chives, raw mushrooms and a yolk. Duck in a can - must get as well! The waiter brings over the can and opens it in front of the table. The content of the can contains the small duck, foie gras, cabbage which is all poured over the bread with carrot purée. The meat was tender and succulent.The service was very good - our waiter was extremely nice and helpful in making suggestions. There are so many options to choose from so it's great if you come with a big group and share everything!This place is insanely delicious.  The restaurant is a bit tight on space but the kitchen is opened. You can actually hear the staff call out orders.  There are so many options that we probably over ordered for two people!! For starters, we had poutine with foie gras, duck carpaccio and beef tongue.  For entrees we had the duck in a can and the blood sausage tart.  The duck in the can was amazing! We totally over did it on the foie gras but you only live once! We had so much foodWe had to call ahead so the restaurant could accommodate our baby.I went with a southern French person to this restaurant but he did not completely agree with my assessment. Just a caveat. :-)We really wanted to try a Montreal special, as this place is very well known. This place has the famous foie gras poutine and Duck in a Can. We decided to all share to try a few more dishes. The baguette is good!The ambience is nice. We went right when it opened and there was a small line waiting. You cannot get seated if you have not made a reservation. Plan ahead. 1. Garden salad: not on the menu, but we figured we were having so many animal parts this was probably a good idea. $15 for generic salad. The salad was fresh but basic. 2. Mushroom risotto: this dish is very expensive for what it is, but you get a show. They come to your table with a large cheese bowl and add the risotto, mushroom, and even Canadian bacon. This dish had potential but was much too salty. It was hard to finish. 3. Terragon Bison tongue: this is tongue well done. The texture is very soft, which is impressive given the quality of most tongues. The sauces and everything just work well together. However, it's game-y so just be warned. 4. Foie gras poutine: loved it. The fries were good. The gravy was also good. The foie gras was in large blocks and was nice and fatty. I think if you come here, you should get this dish! 5. Duck in a Can: I loved watching them pour half a duck out of a can. Life experience. It even looked nice coming out. The duck came out as a thick filet attached to a flap of lard and also fatty liver (foie gras). I enjoyed this dish very much. It was over puréed cauliflower. The issue I had was that the duck meat was very thick. I had to eat it with slices of the lard to complement the taste. Overall a good dish. 6. Dessert: we got the maple cake and the lemon pie. Both were pretty good. Get the maple cake for novelty sake! Very sweet but good flavors. It was a pricy meal, but for a specialty restaurant it made sense.When my friend and I were certain we wanted to try Au Pied de Cochon, I tried to make reservation (1 week in advance) but their voicemail box was full... I didn't know what to do except, trying to call in the following days... And finally, 2 days before the date we wanted to go, I was finally able to make a reservation (but there weren't any tables left, and the lady asked me if it was okay to be seated at the counter/bar, which I was fine with).Being seated at the counter/bar was actually one exciting experience since we were able to watch the chefs cook and take a glance at all the dishes other customers ordered! It was really mind-blowing watching them cook in a fast-moving environment! I really liked their open-kitchen. It was also fun to guess whether the dish was ours or not too (it was our first time at Au Pied de Cochon, so we didn't know what to expect!)Before coming to Au Pied de Cochon, I searched other people's reviews and made my mind that I wanted to try their Duck in a Can! And this was one of the two dishes we ordered. We didn't know what to order next and my friend thought the The PDC Melting Pot has an interesting name, so we ordered that! Our waiter served us bread and butter (we didn't eat a lot since we wanted to save the tummy for our main courses, but the bread was not too hard, it was perfect!)Duck in a Can: Ordered it like I said because a lot of reviews said it is a must there! It is without doubt an interesting and fun dish. It came in a heated can (like how the name of the dish suggested). So, the waiter brought it over and opened it in front of you, poured the content out of the can (which contains the duck breast, 100g of foie gras, cabbages, the sauce) over the bread with carrot and cauliflower purée. The meat was really tender and it went very well with the cabbage, especially when you eat it with a small piece of duck meat. I actually really like the cabbage! It balanced the richness of the duck meat and foie gras very well. The fat under the duck meat was so chewy (I like chewy stuff) but the other fat part was.... I didn't like it since it was too greasy but some people like the feeling of fat melting in the mouth. We finished the dish (expect for the fat part) since it was too much for us.Duck in a can was quite an experience to be honest, it might not be my favorite dish due to its richness and especially oiliness but it was definitely an unique and interesting experience due to the presentation of the dish in a can!PDC Melting Pot:We actually preferred the melting pot because the taste wasn't as heavy as Duck in a Can and the pot was full of surprises, which made it more interesting. This dish came in a pot which was already hinted with its name! There was pork sausages, shiitake mushrooms, buttery potato cheese which was like mashed potatoes with cheese at the bottom, blood sausage -boudin but it is not like the Asian style one-, pork belly (so yummy!), pork loin and onions. There were a lot of things inside the pot; a lots of surprises! I absolutely loved the "buttery potato cheese", it was so delicious and well-made! The pork was tender and everything in this pot went extremely well with the mashed potatoes! The onion sauce was perfect too! It was a rich dish but not overwhelming like Duck in a Can.We also ordered their Milkshake XXX. My thought of my first sip: this is quite sweet... But afterwards, it got better! I don't know what was inside this milkshake... It tasted like rum (I'm not sure if it contained alcohol though). This was one rich milkshake I would say!We were basically in a food coma after this! I would definitely like to come back again and try their bison tongue (saw good reviews about it!)P.S: Make sure to make a reservation!!! Keep on trying even when their voicemail box is full!Service is outstanding. The employees are so attentive and seem to really love their jobs. Food it also outstanding and some of the best I have had in Montreal. I will say the food is really heavy and I don't want to think about the fat and calories. You'll probably walk out having eaten 2000 calories and well over 50 grams of fat, per person. Then again, if you really care about that stuff, subways right around the corner. Treat yourself, check it out. You will not be disappointed.We came to celebrate my husband's birthday. We reserved via email. It's the easiest way. I highly recommend reserving this way. I do not recommend going on Sunday's. They're out of everything. They were out of a few items. I didn't care for some, but being out of Ribs, Sweetbread, and BEER?! That was very disappointing. I ended up getting the famous Duck in a Can. Great flavour. Very delicious. Duck cooked to perfection. Then the Ragout. I liked the texture and how all the ingredients complimented each other, but it was wayyy too salty. I loved how it was prepared in a cheese block in front of us. Our waitress was rude and short with everything. Uninformative. We felt very rushed by her. Pretty much everything sucked but the Duck in a Can. I will come back and perhaps the experience will be better to tie with the good food.One of the best restaurants I have ever been to (if not the best).I had the duck in a can and my friend the risotto.The risotto is mixed in inside a large parmeggiano cheesw block and the duck is cooked inside the can for 27 minutes to a perfect taste.What an experienceService was great too!!Ouff getting a reservation at au PdeC was not an easy task ... who still operates over voicemail? Especially over a voicemail box that is always full?!But au PdeC still seems to get away with it thanks to all the hype Anthony Bourdain created during his 24 hour Montreal layover (if you've never watched it: dailymotion.com/.../xo2k…...).Needless to say, we had to try it out ourselves or we couldn't be called true Montrealers. But the overwhelming foie gras stuffed courses were too much for two people to handle, so we brought 2 friends for back up! All in all, if you come knowing that this will not be a fine dining experience and that you WILL be overindulging in rich and heavy courses, then your experience will be a satisfying one. And let's be honest, everything just tastes better with fat!From the foie gras stuffed croquettes that just ooze in your mouth as you bite into them, to the decadent poutine topped with foie gras gravy and a whole piece of foie gras and then the squash risotto cooked in a whole wheel of parmesan...! Your reward center will be firing away happy signals for hours to come smile emoticonAll this goodness, paired with a nice bottle of french wine (they have an extensive french heavy wine list and some good beer on tap) made this a highly enjoyable 'tourist in your own city experience'. Good food, good wine and great company along with a surprisingly affordable tab... what's not to like?Heard lots of great reviews for Au Pied de Cochon. This restaurant was featured on one of the shows by Anthony Bourdain! Service was excellent.DRINKS:Pied de Cochon beer x 2TERRAINE OF FOIE GRAS (4/5)Came with jam and bread. So delicious - it's pure foie gras. The taste is very strong and flavourful. A must for foie gras lovers :) I actually enjoyed this dish better without adding the jam on my slice of bread.FOIE GRAS POUTINE (5/5)A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! The closer you are to Montreal, the better the poutine gets and this one is a 5-star poutine for sure! Large slices of foie gras and big chunks of cheese.. mm fatty good!DUCK IN A CAN (5/5)So creative! It's a mini show when the waiter comes over and open the can in front of us (I recorded it all haha). The duck meat was tender and juicy - delicious. I would order this again the next time I visit Au Pied de Cochon.This place is the epitome of French Canadian cuisine. If you want an authentic Canadian culinary experience then this is not to be missed. The food is not for the faint of hearts and definitely leave your vegetarian friends at home. I wouldn't say this is a good everyday-go-to kinda restaurant so come here when you have visitors from out of town or for a special occasion. On to our meal. After cleansing our palettes with foie gras croquettes, we were ready for our main event. We bravely ordered the whole pig's head for two and I can say that it has been one of my most memorable meals. The head of pig was roasted to glistening perfection. Paired with apple and root veggies, the whole plate was full of flavour and tender juicy porky deliciousness. Since they have an open kitchen, people took pictures of our food as it made its way towards our table. It was quite the show! Have to admit I couldn't eat pork for a couple of weeks after but it was definitely worth every bite. Eating at Au Pied is a special event you don't want to miss.Do you love ducks? Or better yet, do you hate ducks? To the point where you'll eat ducks in every form for 3 different dishes? If so, Au Pied de Cochon is just what the doctor ordered.Sure, the name translates to the pig's feet, but the duck is where it's at.Foie gras poutine is about as rich and delicious as it sounds.The duck in a can (which COMES WITH FOIE GRAS) is also a must. Just watching the waiter take a can opener to it and drop it onto a plate is a thing of beauty. The entire can is boiled and then brought out. All the spices are infused and all the fattiness is preserved without getting boiled off. Super unique. Just don't overdo it. One can is probably enough for 3-4 people unless you REALLY want to feel unhealthy.We also got a side of duck fat fries, because WHY THE HELL NOT?There were 8 of us, so we did a few other entrees as well. One was the PDC's cut, which the waiter told us was a boneless pork chop (there was a bone). It looked dry, but it was actually incredibly moist. It was a gigantic hunk of meat too.We also did one of the specials - the Ahi tuna steak for two. Let me tell you, it was NOT for two. Maybe if you fasted and that was the only thing you ate that day. But it was also good. Perfectly rare, with a ton of veggies and cheese on the side. It was probably our least favorite of the dishes, but even still, it was very well done.We were seated all the way in the back by the wine cellar, so it was a bit of a tight squeeze (especially with another large group next to us), but there wasn't much else to complain about. They also have one hell of a wine list.Our waiter was super cool and gave us shots to round out the night.Probably one of the best meals I've ever had. Also, why I came back to the States with none of pants fitting anymore.Make reservations! Either call/email or reserve online. It's a must. Also come hungry, because, they serve a lot of food.This place gets super packed during the dinner rush. Even dining at the counter gets full.I'd recommend the foie gras duo to get the best out of APC. If you're dining with friends, then I'm sure you can taste each other's food. But for a single diner like myself, the foie gras duo comes with Foie Gras burger and foie gras poutine fries. Huge portions for about $50. Very fatty, very rich, and very good.I started off with the tuna tartare as an appetizer, but even though it is a small portion, I couldn't get through my foie gras duo because of the enormity of the portions. The tuna tartare was tarty and fresh.And I still wanted dessert after and I chose the toffee maple milk shake. They made it right in front me...I guess because I was in the counter, but you can see all the fatty goodness when they make this. Not to sweet, but I had enough room to finish it. I would order this again.Trying to find street parking might be hard for you during dinner time. And the metro station is several blocks away. You can probably try the bixi bikes if you have time to roam around this part of the Montreal neighborhood.Drip Drip Drip4 star for food and service but -0.5 star for all the water dripping from the vent on top of my head all through my dinner.Drip Drip Dip I know it was one of the hottest weekend in Montreal. It was end of July after all and I should be thankful for the nice cool interior of the restaurant with their AC on full blast. But with the water dripping on me the whole time (2 hour) while I was enjoying my dinner was not cool. The staff was all trying their best to stop the dripping from top of the AC vent which ran across the full depth of the restaurant by a squeegee sponge but it was not working....Drip Drip DripDinner was really good!! Excellent!We shared Tarragon Bison Tongue ($8.50) - I just love the Cornichon in that! And now I have a bottle in my fridge at home!Pâté de Campagne ($9) - So smooth and rich!Duck Carpaccio ($14) - Well seasoned, my first time having duck carpaccioDuck in a Can ($44) - So overhyped! The duck was dry and just not good! Foie Gras was so so. I don't believe I said that but I preferred mine seared...Braised Pig Feet with Side Pasta ($50) Seasonal - Must Order!! It was so tender and flavoured!! And the pasta which was prepared table side was so good! Perfect al dente and with BACON... Drip Drip DripI would have up my star to a 4 because the food was just amazing and the service was excellent. But the management really need to do something about their cooling system. I definitely would be back! PS The reservation system just got so much better as my reservation was confirmed by email and no need to play phone tag again!We had the foie gras poutine, stuffed pied de cochon with foie gras and a tuna dish. All were very rich in flavor and will lead to a heart attack BUT worth every bite. Poutine- get it! after all it is a Canadian dishStuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras- this is large enough for 3-4 people to share, the best part about this dish was the MASHED POTATO, it is sooooooooo good! it has a different texture from the typical mushy mashed potato. Tuna dish- our waiter picked this for us so I don't know what it's called but it's a pretty good dish with gravy and mashed potato on the bottom but it was a little salty though. Overall, amazing FATTY French Canadian food.Very rich food. If you like your food too creamy or too buttery, then this is your type of food. Everything was just very heavy and I couldn't seem to finish the dish. The FG is actually not bad as this was my first time tasting it. Definitely not something I would typically eat but at least I tried it! Plogue Champlain $29Pork filet $30Fg hamburger $39Squash risotto $24Fg poutine $24Eel tart $14The place was jam packed and there's absolutely no room to move if you're sitting on the outside of the table. Service is slow because of how busy it is. Might take you 10min to get the attention of a waitress and another 10 for the bill. Overall definitely a place to try but not something I would do again as its not really my type of food fare.I am judging overall as a meal and the service. First off, the place doesnt have a banner so it is difficult to spot if you dont know where it is. Foie gras poutine. Very good, the foie gras melted in with the poutine and you were able to taste the foie gras. The texture or the plate was consistant, there was cheesy, crispy and then the foie gras made it very good. you were able to taste that the fries were fried in the duck fat and the gravy was creamy and rich. with that being said, a very good dish but will get heavy and sickening after you eat too much of it.Foie gras a la champlain. foie gras on top of a thick slice of bacon, on a bed of thin crispy potato pancake (like a thin hashbrown), topped with a generous amount of maple syrup sauce. First bite was veryyyyy good!! So cripsy from the potato, the bacon was thick and the foie gras was enhanced in this plate, the maple syrup sauce was a good amount of sweet and salty. But this is definitely not a plate you eat on your own, its best for sharing because after a while the taste and maple syrup is quite overwhelming. table side Squash risotto. risotto was cooked very well but since it was table side she made it in the a large parmesan cheese, mixed it all together. She over poured the chicken broth and the risotto became a soup. The waiter asked how it was and I told him honestly that I did not like it because it was too watery. He left then about 3-4 mins later he asked me "do you want me to take it to the chef to try it", well no obviously not! She should have known when she served it because it was clearly too watery. He knew I was unhappy and he was the one that was pushing for this squash risotto, he didnt do anything to make up for the bad dish. At a resto like that I would expect so much more. Overall, theres definitely better. I'm glad I tried it but I would not be returning.We made the reservation two weeks ago. Probably because it's weekday, we are the only customers at 5:00pm.We didn't drink alcohol, only a bottle of water. The water is in glass bottle, taste better than thesame brand in plastic bottle.Tarragon Bison Tongue is the first dish. The tongue is from beef. Mr. Tang said it's good. I prefer the pickle, since I didn't try the tongue.Catch of the day, we picked the smoked eel. It also served with a piece of veal bone, you can eat the marrow(not sure if it's this word...).Fg poutine is great, although foie gras is too greasy for me.The duck in a can is great too. The duck is juicy and fresh, also with blood. The veggie taste a bit sour, really savory.The one missing star is for the dessert. Both icecream and pecan pie are too sweet for me to enjoy.After much hype, I made it here with a few colleagues on a Wednesday evening. The place was absolutely hopping and hard to get into, but we made a reservation a few weeks in advance.Once inside we sat at the bar, which is by far the best seat in the house. It comes with a direct view of the kitchen and all the goodness the chefs are whipping up. We started out with the ham special for appetizer, which was delicious. It came with a baguette and butter which made it perfect. We then had some poutine, which was also quite good. It was definitely better quality than most poutine dishes. For the main course, I went aggressive and got a mixed bowl consisting of blood sausage, pork sausage, mushrooms and onions sitting on top of mashed potatoes. The dish was very good, but not the amazing experience I was hoping for. Spices could have been a little better, but make no mistake it was a very good dish.With its popular reputation, upbeat atmosphere and good food, this is definitely a place worth visiting when in town. They also have a really good bar with interesting drinks. Great overall experience.Delicious food and a must if you're in Montreal. Come in hungry bc you'll get a rich and hearty meal.

Food it also outstanding and some of the best I have had in Montreal. I will say the food is really heavy and I don't want to think about the fat and calories. You'll probably walk out having eaten 2000 calories and well over 50 grams of fat, per person. Then again, if you really care about that stuff, subways right around the corner. Treat yourself, check it out. You will not be disappointed.We came to celebrate my husband's birthday. We reserved via email. It's the easiest way. I highly recommend reserving this way. I do not recommend going on Sunday's. They're out of everything. They were out of a few items. I didn't care for some, but being out of Ribs, Sweetbread, and BEER?! That was very disappointing. I ended up getting the famous Duck in a Can. Great flavour. Very delicious. Duck cooked to perfection. Then the Ragout. I liked the texture and how all the ingredients complimented each other, but it was wayyy too salty. I loved how it was prepared in a cheese block in front of us. Our waitress was rude and short with everything. Uninformative. We felt very rushed by her. Pretty much everything sucked but the Duck in a Can. I will come back and perhaps the experience will be better to tie with the good food.One of the best restaurants I have ever been to (if not the best).I had the duck in a can and my friend the risotto.The risotto is mixed in inside a large parmeggiano cheesw block and the duck is cooked inside the can for 27 minutes to a perfect taste.What an experienceService was great too!!Ouff getting a reservation at au PdeC was not an easy task ... who still operates over voicemail? Especially over a voicemail box that is always full?!But au PdeC still seems to get away with it thanks to all the hype Anthony Bourdain created during his 24 hour Montreal layover (if you've never watched it: dailymotion.com/.../xo2k…...).Needless to say, we had to try it out ourselves or we couldn't be called true Montrealers. But the overwhelming foie gras stuffed courses were too much for two people to handle, so we brought 2 friends for back up! All in all, if you come knowing that this will not be a fine dining experience and that you WILL be overindulging in rich and heavy courses, then your experience will be a satisfying one. And let's be honest, everything just tastes better with fat!From the foie gras stuffed croquettes that just ooze in your mouth as you bite into them, to the decadent poutine topped with foie gras gravy and a whole piece of foie gras and then the squash risotto cooked in a whole wheel of parmesan...! Your reward center will be firing away happy signals for hours to come smile emoticonAll this goodness, paired with a nice bottle of french wine (they have an extensive french heavy wine list and some good beer on tap) made this a highly enjoyable 'tourist in your own city experience'. Good food, good wine and great company along with a surprisingly affordable tab... what's not to like?Heard lots of great reviews for Au Pied de Cochon. This restaurant was featured on one of the shows by Anthony Bourdain! Service was excellent.DRINKS:Pied de Cochon beer x 2TERRAINE OF FOIE GRAS (4/5)Came with jam and bread. So delicious - it's pure foie gras. The taste is very strong and flavourful. A must for foie gras lovers :) I actually enjoyed this dish better without adding the jam on my slice of bread.FOIE GRAS POUTINE (5/5)A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! The closer you are to Montreal, the better the poutine gets and this one is a 5-star poutine for sure! Large slices of foie gras and big chunks of cheese.. mm fatty good!DUCK IN A CAN (5/5)So creative! It's a mini show when the waiter comes over and open the can in front of us (I recorded it all haha). The duck meat was tender and juicy - delicious. I would order this again the next time I visit Au Pied de Cochon.This place is the epitome of French Canadian cuisine. If you want an authentic Canadian culinary experience then this is not to be missed. The food is not for the faint of hearts and definitely leave your vegetarian friends at home. I wouldn't say this is a good everyday-go-to kinda restaurant so come here when you have visitors from out of town or for a special occasion. On to our meal. After cleansing our palettes with foie gras croquettes, we were ready for our main event. We bravely ordered the whole pig's head for two and I can say that it has been one of my most memorable meals. The head of pig was roasted to glistening perfection. Paired with apple and root veggies, the whole plate was full of flavour and tender juicy porky deliciousness. Since they have an open kitchen, people took pictures of our food as it made its way towards our table. It was quite the show! Have to admit I couldn't eat pork for a couple of weeks after but it was definitely worth every bite. Eating at Au Pied is a special event you don't want to miss.Do you love ducks? Or better yet, do you hate ducks? To the point where you'll eat ducks in every form for 3 different dishes? If so, Au Pied de Cochon is just what the doctor ordered.Sure, the name translates to the pig's feet, but the duck is where it's at.Foie gras poutine is about as rich and delicious as it sounds.The duck in a can (which COMES WITH FOIE GRAS) is also a must. Just watching the waiter take a can opener to it and drop it onto a plate is a thing of beauty. The entire can is boiled and then brought out. All the spices are infused and all the fattiness is preserved without getting boiled off. Super unique. Just don't overdo it. One can is probably enough for 3-4 people unless you REALLY want to feel unhealthy.We also got a side of duck fat fries, because WHY THE HELL NOT?There were 8 of us, so we did a few other entrees as well. One was the PDC's cut, which the waiter told us was a boneless pork chop (there was a bone). It looked dry, but it was actually incredibly moist. It was a gigantic hunk of meat too.We also did one of the specials - the Ahi tuna steak for two. Let me tell you, it was NOT for two. Maybe if you fasted and that was the only thing you ate that day. But it was also good. Perfectly rare, with a ton of veggies and cheese on the side. It was probably our least favorite of the dishes, but even still, it was very well done.We were seated all the way in the back by the wine cellar, so it was a bit of a tight squeeze (especially with another large group next to us), but there wasn't much else to complain about. They also have one hell of a wine list.Our waiter was super cool and gave us shots to round out the night.Probably one of the best meals I've ever had. Also, why I came back to the States with none of pants fitting anymore.Make reservations! Either call/email or reserve online. It's a must. Also come hungry, because, they serve a lot of food.This place gets super packed during the dinner rush. Even dining at the counter gets full.I'd recommend the foie gras duo to get the best out of APC. If you're dining with friends, then I'm sure you can taste each other's food. But for a single diner like myself, the foie gras duo comes with Foie Gras burger and foie gras poutine fries. Huge portions for about $50. Very fatty, very rich, and very good.I started off with the tuna tartare as an appetizer, but even though it is a small portion, I couldn't get through my foie gras duo because of the enormity of the portions. The tuna tartare was tarty and fresh.And I still wanted dessert after and I chose the toffee maple milk shake. They made it right in front me...I guess because I was in the counter, but you can see all the fatty goodness when they make this. Not to sweet, but I had enough room to finish it. I would order this again.Trying to find street parking might be hard for you during dinner time. And the metro station is several blocks away. You can probably try the bixi bikes if you have time to roam around this part of the Montreal neighborhood.Drip Drip Drip4 star for food and service but -0.5 star for all the water dripping from the vent on top of my head all through my dinner.Drip Drip Dip I know it was one of the hottest weekend in Montreal. It was end of July after all and I should be thankful for the nice cool interior of the restaurant with their AC on full blast. But with the water dripping on me the whole time (2 hour) while I was enjoying my dinner was not cool. The staff was all trying their best to stop the dripping from top of the AC vent which ran across the full depth of the restaurant by a squeegee sponge but it was not working....Drip Drip DripDinner was really good!! Excellent!We shared Tarragon Bison Tongue ($8.50) - I just love the Cornichon in that! And now I have a bottle in my fridge at home!Pâté de Campagne ($9) - So smooth and rich!Duck Carpaccio ($14) - Well seasoned, my first time having duck carpaccioDuck in a Can ($44) - So overhyped! The duck was dry and just not good! Foie Gras was so so. I don't believe I said that but I preferred mine seared...Braised Pig Feet with Side Pasta ($50) Seasonal - Must Order!! It was so tender and flavoured!! And the pasta which was prepared table side was so good! Perfect al dente and with BACON... Drip Drip DripI would have up my star to a 4 because the food was just amazing and the service was excellent. But the management really need to do something about their cooling system. I definitely would be back! PS The reservation system just got so much better as my reservation was confirmed by email and no need to play phone tag again!We had the foie gras poutine, stuffed pied de cochon with foie gras and a tuna dish. All were very rich in flavor and will lead to a heart attack BUT worth every bite. Poutine- get it! after all it is a Canadian dishStuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras- this is large enough for 3-4 people to share, the best part about this dish was the MASHED POTATO, it is sooooooooo good! it has a different texture from the typical mushy mashed potato. Tuna dish- our waiter picked this for us so I don't know what it's called but it's a pretty good dish with gravy and mashed potato on the bottom but it was a little salty though. Overall, amazing FATTY French Canadian food.Very rich food. If you like your food too creamy or too buttery, then this is your type of food. Everything was just very heavy and I couldn't seem to finish the dish. The FG is actually not bad as this was my first time tasting it. Definitely not something I would typically eat but at least I tried it! Plogue Champlain $29Pork filet $30Fg hamburger $39Squash risotto $24Fg poutine $24Eel tart $14The place was jam packed and there's absolutely no room to move if you're sitting on the outside of the table. Service is slow because of how busy it is. Might take you 10min to get the attention of a waitress and another 10 for the bill. Overall definitely a place to try but not something I would do again as its not really my type of food fare.I am judging overall as a meal and the service. First off, the place doesnt have a banner so it is difficult to spot if you dont know where it is. Foie gras poutine. Very good, the foie gras melted in with the poutine and you were able to taste the foie gras. The texture or the plate was consistant, there was cheesy, crispy and then the foie gras made it very good. you were able to taste that the fries were fried in the duck fat and the gravy was creamy and rich. with that being said, a very good dish but will get heavy and sickening after you eat too much of it.Foie gras a la champlain. foie gras on top of a thick slice of bacon, on a bed of thin crispy potato pancake (like a thin hashbrown), topped with a generous amount of maple syrup sauce. First bite was veryyyyy good!! So cripsy from the potato, the bacon was thick and the foie gras was enhanced in this plate, the maple syrup sauce was a good amount of sweet and salty. But this is definitely not a plate you eat on your own, its best for sharing because after a while the taste and maple syrup is quite overwhelming. table side Squash risotto. risotto was cooked very well but since it was table side she made it in the a large parmesan cheese, mixed it all together. She over poured the chicken broth and the risotto became a soup. The waiter asked how it was and I told him honestly that I did not like it because it was too watery. He left then about 3-4 mins later he asked me "do you want me to take it to the chef to try it", well no obviously not! She should have known when she served it because it was clearly too watery. He knew I was unhappy and he was the one that was pushing for this squash risotto, he didnt do anything to make up for the bad dish. At a resto like that I would expect so much more. Overall, theres definitely better. I'm glad I tried it but I would not be returning.We made the reservation two weeks ago. Probably because it's weekday, we are the only customers at 5:00pm.We didn't drink alcohol, only a bottle of water. The water is in glass bottle, taste better than thesame brand in plastic bottle.Tarragon Bison Tongue is the first dish. The tongue is from beef. Mr. Tang said it's good. I prefer the pickle, since I didn't try the tongue.Catch of the day, we picked the smoked eel. It also served with a piece of veal bone, you can eat the marrow(not sure if it's this word...).Fg poutine is great, although foie gras is too greasy for me.The duck in a can is great too. The duck is juicy and fresh, also with blood. The veggie taste a bit sour, really savory.The one missing star is for the dessert. Both icecream and pecan pie are too sweet for me to enjoy.After much hype, I made it here with a few colleagues on a Wednesday evening. The place was absolutely hopping and hard to get into, but we made a reservation a few weeks in advance.Once inside we sat at the bar, which is by far the best seat in the house. It comes with a direct view of the kitchen and all the goodness the chefs are whipping up. We started out with the ham special for appetizer, which was delicious. It came with a baguette and butter which made it perfect. We then had some poutine, which was also quite good. It was definitely better quality than most poutine dishes. For the main course, I went aggressive and got a mixed bowl consisting of blood sausage, pork sausage, mushrooms and onions sitting on top of mashed potatoes. The dish was very good, but not the amazing experience I was hoping for. Spices could have been a little better, but make no mistake it was a very good dish.With its popular reputation, upbeat atmosphere and good food, this is definitely a place worth visiting when in town. They also have a really good bar with interesting drinks. Great overall experience.Delicious food and a must if you're in Montreal. Come in hungry bc you'll get a rich and hearty meal. We ordered the infamous duck in a can, mushroom tortellini (tonites special), the steamed dumplings & plogue a Champlain "foie gras breakfast" - which was the highlight of the night. buckwheat pancake,  thick Canadian bacon, potatoes and cheese topped with foie gras. I wish it was one of the earlier items delivered I would have enjoyed a few more bites. Would def come here with a group to be able to taste more items on the menu. It's a busy restaurant so do make reservations. We scored 9:30 pm reservations on a Sunday night and place was packed with ppl still coming in with reservations after us. Service was slow and we had a really long wait b/t entrees coming out. We didn't leave until after 11:30. Luckily for us, our toddler was still on California time and was cooperative.Visit Montreal for a weekend and made a reservation two weeks in advance. Not too hard: I left a voicemail and someone called me back the next day. Between my friend and I, we ordered:- cromesquis de foie gras, basically deep fried fg. For $4, it was worth it. - temaki tartare, tartare Japanese hand roll. They didn't have bison available and we were offered veal. I quite enjoyed the layers of flavour and texture. - carpaccio de canard, duck carpaccio. My second favorite of the night. - and finally, poutine au foie gras. I hate to say it but this was a bit of a disappointment. I'm a fan of fg but this didn't have the ah-ha for me. We went later in the evening and 2 of the 3 cocktails were already sold out. My reco would be to go early. We also had a lot of trouble finding this place late at night. You really have to know what the front looks like!If you love pork and foie gras, this place is heaven. Recommend getting the foie gras poutine and the duck in a can. We also ordered the onion soup, duck carpaccio and the dumplings.Onion soup - your standard cheesy onion soup done right. Super tasty. Foie gras Poutine - must get!! Abundance of extra buttery and fatty foie gras with fries and gravy. This is a heavy dish so great for sharing and having a cold beer. Duck carpaccio - the presentation of the dish was beautiful. Thinly slice duck with chives, raw mushrooms and a yolk. Duck in a can - must get as well! The waiter brings over the can and opens it in front of the table. The content of the can contains the small duck, foie gras, cabbage which is all poured over the bread with carrot purée. The meat was tender and succulent.The service was very good - our waiter was extremely nice and helpful in making suggestions. There are so many options to choose from so it's great if you come with a big group and share everything!This place is insanely delicious.  The restaurant is a bit tight on space but the kitchen is opened. You can actually hear the staff call out orders.  There are so many options that we probably over ordered for two people!! For starters, we had poutine with foie gras, duck carpaccio and beef tongue.  For entrees we had the duck in a can and the blood sausage tart.  The duck in the can was amazing! We totally over did it on the foie gras but you only live once! We had so much foodWe had to call ahead so the restaurant could accommodate our baby.I went with a southern French person to this restaurant but he did not completely agree with my assessment. Just a caveat. :-)We really wanted to try a Montreal special, as this place is very well known. This place has the famous foie gras poutine and Duck in a Can. We decided to all share to try a few more dishes. The baguette is good!The ambience is nice. We went right when it opened and there was a small line waiting. You cannot get seated if you have not made a reservation. Plan ahead. 1. Garden salad: not on the menu, but we figured we were having so many animal parts this was probably a good idea. $15 for generic salad. The salad was fresh but basic. 2. Mushroom risotto: this dish is very expensive for what it is, but you get a show. They come to your table with a large cheese bowl and add the risotto, mushroom, and even Canadian bacon. This dish had potential but was much too salty. It was hard to finish. 3. Terragon Bison tongue: this is tongue well done. The texture is very soft, which is impressive given the quality of most tongues. The sauces and everything just work well together. However, it's game-y so just be warned. 4. Foie gras poutine: loved it. The fries were good. The gravy was also good. The foie gras was in large blocks and was nice and fatty. I think if you come here, you should get this dish! 5. Duck in a Can: I loved watching them pour half a duck out of a can. Life experience. It even looked nice coming out. The duck came out as a thick filet attached to a flap of lard and also fatty liver (foie gras). I enjoyed this dish very much. It was over puréed cauliflower. The issue I had was that the duck meat was very thick. I had to eat it with slices of the lard to complement the taste. Overall a good dish. 6. Dessert: we got the maple cake and the lemon pie. Both were pretty good. Get the maple cake for novelty sake! Very sweet but good flavors. It was a pricy meal, but for a specialty restaurant it made sense.When my friend and I were certain we wanted to try Au Pied de Cochon, I tried to make reservation (1 week in advance) but their voicemail box was full... I didn't know what to do except, trying to call in the following days... And finally, 2 days before the date we wanted to go, I was finally able to make a reservation (but there weren't any tables left, and the lady asked me if it was okay to be seated at the counter/bar, which I was fine with).Being seated at the counter/bar was actually one exciting experience since we were able to watch the chefs cook and take a glance at all the dishes other customers ordered! It was really mind-blowing watching them cook in a fast-moving environment! I really liked their open-kitchen. It was also fun to guess whether the dish was ours or not too (it was our first time at Au Pied de Cochon, so we didn't know what to expect!)Before coming to Au Pied de Cochon, I searched other people's reviews and made my mind that I wanted to try their Duck in a Can! And this was one of the two dishes we ordered. We didn't know what to order next and my friend thought the The PDC Melting Pot has an interesting name, so we ordered that! Our waiter served us bread and butter (we didn't eat a lot since we wanted to save the tummy for our main courses, but the bread was not too hard, it was perfect!)Duck in a Can: Ordered it like I said because a lot of reviews said it is a must there! It is without doubt an interesting and fun dish. It came in a heated can (like how the name of the dish suggested). So, the waiter brought it over and opened it in front of you, poured the content out of the can (which contains the duck breast, 100g of foie gras, cabbages, the sauce) over the bread with carrot and cauliflower purée. The meat was really tender and it went very well with the cabbage, especially when you eat it with a small piece of duck meat. I actually really like the cabbage! It balanced the richness of the duck meat and foie gras very well. The fat under the duck meat was so chewy (I like chewy stuff) but the other fat part was.... I didn't like it since it was too greasy but some people like the feeling of fat melting in the mouth. We finished the dish (expect for the fat part) since it was too much for us.Duck in a can was quite an experience to be honest, it might not be my favorite dish due to its richness and especially oiliness but it was definitely an unique and interesting experience due to the presentation of the dish in a can!PDC Melting Pot:We actually preferred the melting pot because the taste wasn't as heavy as Duck in a Can and the pot was full of surprises, which made it more interesting. This dish came in a pot which was already hinted with its name! There was pork sausages, shiitake mushrooms, buttery potato cheese which was like mashed potatoes with cheese at the bottom, blood sausage -boudin but it is not like the Asian style one-, pork belly (so yummy!), pork loin and onions. There were a lot of things inside the pot; a lots of surprises! I absolutely loved the "buttery potato cheese", it was so delicious and well-made! The pork was tender and everything in this pot went extremely well with the mashed potatoes! The onion sauce was perfect too! It was a rich dish but not overwhelming like Duck in a Can.We also ordered their Milkshake XXX. My thought of my first sip: this is quite sweet... But afterwards, it got better! I don't know what was inside this milkshake... It tasted like rum (I'm not sure if it contained alcohol though). This was one rich milkshake I would say!We were basically in a food coma after this! I would definitely like to come back again and try their bison tongue (saw good reviews about it!)P.S: Make sure to make a reservation!!! Keep on trying even when their voicemail box is full!Service is outstanding. The employees are so attentive and seem to really love their jobs. Food it also outstanding and some of the best I have had in Montreal. I will say the food is really heavy and I don't want to think about the fat and calories.

PS The reservation system just got so much better as my reservation was confirmed by email and no need to play phone tag again!We had the foie gras poutine, stuffed pied de cochon with foie gras and a tuna dish. All were very rich in flavor and will lead to a heart attack BUT worth every bite. Poutine- get it! after all it is a Canadian dishStuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras- this is large enough for 3-4 people to share, the best part about this dish was the MASHED POTATO, it is sooooooooo good! it has a different texture from the typical mushy mashed potato. Tuna dish- our waiter picked this for us so I don't know what it's called but it's a pretty good dish with gravy and mashed potato on the bottom but it was a little salty though. Overall, amazing FATTY French Canadian food.Very rich food. If you like your food too creamy or too buttery, then this is your type of food. Everything was just very heavy and I couldn't seem to finish the dish. The FG is actually not bad as this was my first time tasting it. Definitely not something I would typically eat but at least I tried it! Plogue Champlain $29Pork filet $30Fg hamburger $39Squash risotto $24Fg poutine $24Eel tart $14The place was jam packed and there's absolutely no room to move if you're sitting on the outside of the table. Service is slow because of how busy it is. Might take you 10min to get the attention of a waitress and another 10 for the bill. Overall definitely a place to try but not something I would do again as its not really my type of food fare.I am judging overall as a meal and the service. First off, the place doesnt have a banner so it is difficult to spot if you dont know where it is. Foie gras poutine. Very good, the foie gras melted in with the poutine and you were able to taste the foie gras. The texture or the plate was consistant, there was cheesy, crispy and then the foie gras made it very good. you were able to taste that the fries were fried in the duck fat and the gravy was creamy and rich. with that being said, a very good dish but will get heavy and sickening after you eat too much of it.Foie gras a la champlain. foie gras on top of a thick slice of bacon, on a bed of thin crispy potato pancake (like a thin hashbrown), topped with a generous amount of maple syrup sauce. First bite was veryyyyy good!! So cripsy from the potato, the bacon was thick and the foie gras was enhanced in this plate, the maple syrup sauce was a good amount of sweet and salty. But this is definitely not a plate you eat on your own, its best for sharing because after a while the taste and maple syrup is quite overwhelming. table side Squash risotto. risotto was cooked very well but since it was table side she made it in the a large parmesan cheese, mixed it all together. She over poured the chicken broth and the risotto became a soup. The waiter asked how it was and I told him honestly that I did not like it because it was too watery. He left then about 3-4 mins later he asked me "do you want me to take it to the chef to try it", well no obviously not! She should have known when she served it because it was clearly too watery. He knew I was unhappy and he was the one that was pushing for this squash risotto, he didnt do anything to make up for the bad dish. At a resto like that I would expect so much more. Overall, theres definitely better. I'm glad I tried it but I would not be returning.We made the reservation two weeks ago. Probably because it's weekday, we are the only customers at 5:00pm.We didn't drink alcohol, only a bottle of water. The water is in glass bottle, taste better than thesame brand in plastic bottle.Tarragon Bison Tongue is the first dish. The tongue is from beef. Mr. Tang said it's good. I prefer the pickle, since I didn't try the tongue.Catch of the day, we picked the smoked eel. It also served with a piece of veal bone, you can eat the marrow(not sure if it's this word...).Fg poutine is great, although foie gras is too greasy for me.The duck in a can is great too. The duck is juicy and fresh, also with blood. The veggie taste a bit sour, really savory.The one missing star is for the dessert. Both icecream and pecan pie are too sweet for me to enjoy.After much hype, I made it here with a few colleagues on a Wednesday evening. The place was absolutely hopping and hard to get into, but we made a reservation a few weeks in advance.Once inside we sat at the bar, which is by far the best seat in the house. It comes with a direct view of the kitchen and all the goodness the chefs are whipping up. We started out with the ham special for appetizer, which was delicious. It came with a baguette and butter which made it perfect. We then had some poutine, which was also quite good. It was definitely better quality than most poutine dishes. For the main course, I went aggressive and got a mixed bowl consisting of blood sausage, pork sausage, mushrooms and onions sitting on top of mashed potatoes. The dish was very good, but not the amazing experience I was hoping for. Spices could have been a little better, but make no mistake it was a very good dish.With its popular reputation, upbeat atmosphere and good food, this is definitely a place worth visiting when in town. They also have a really good bar with interesting drinks. Great overall experience.Delicious food and a must if you're in Montreal. Come in hungry bc you'll get a rich and hearty meal. We ordered the infamous duck in a can, mushroom tortellini (tonites special), the steamed dumplings & plogue a Champlain "foie gras breakfast" - which was the highlight of the night. buckwheat pancake,  thick Canadian bacon, potatoes and cheese topped with foie gras. I wish it was one of the earlier items delivered I would have enjoyed a few more bites. Would def come here with a group to be able to taste more items on the menu. It's a busy restaurant so do make reservations. We scored 9:30 pm reservations on a Sunday night and place was packed with ppl still coming in with reservations after us. Service was slow and we had a really long wait b/t entrees coming out. We didn't leave until after 11:30. Luckily for us, our toddler was still on California time and was cooperative.Visit Montreal for a weekend and made a reservation two weeks in advance. Not too hard: I left a voicemail and someone called me back the next day. Between my friend and I, we ordered:- cromesquis de foie gras, basically deep fried fg. For $4, it was worth it. - temaki tartare, tartare Japanese hand roll. They didn't have bison available and we were offered veal. I quite enjoyed the layers of flavour and texture. - carpaccio de canard, duck carpaccio. My second favorite of the night. - and finally, poutine au foie gras. I hate to say it but this was a bit of a disappointment. I'm a fan of fg but this didn't have the ah-ha for me. We went later in the evening and 2 of the 3 cocktails were already sold out. My reco would be to go early. We also had a lot of trouble finding this place late at night. You really have to know what the front looks like!If you love pork and foie gras, this place is heaven. Recommend getting the foie gras poutine and the duck in a can. We also ordered the onion soup, duck carpaccio and the dumplings.Onion soup - your standard cheesy onion soup done right. Super tasty. Foie gras Poutine - must get!! Abundance of extra buttery and fatty foie gras with fries and gravy. This is a heavy dish so great for sharing and having a cold beer. Duck carpaccio - the presentation of the dish was beautiful. Thinly slice duck with chives, raw mushrooms and a yolk. Duck in a can - must get as well! The waiter brings over the can and opens it in front of the table. The content of the can contains the small duck, foie gras, cabbage which is all poured over the bread with carrot purée. The meat was tender and succulent.The service was very good - our waiter was extremely nice and helpful in making suggestions. There are so many options to choose from so it's great if you come with a big group and share everything!This place is insanely delicious.  The restaurant is a bit tight on space but the kitchen is opened. You can actually hear the staff call out orders.  There are so many options that we probably over ordered for two people!! For starters, we had poutine with foie gras, duck carpaccio and beef tongue.  For entrees we had the duck in a can and the blood sausage tart.  The duck in the can was amazing! We totally over did it on the foie gras but you only live once! We had so much foodWe had to call ahead so the restaurant could accommodate our baby.I went with a southern French person to this restaurant but he did not completely agree with my assessment. Just a caveat. :-)We really wanted to try a Montreal special, as this place is very well known. This place has the famous foie gras poutine and Duck in a Can. We decided to all share to try a few more dishes. The baguette is good!The ambience is nice. We went right when it opened and there was a small line waiting. You cannot get seated if you have not made a reservation. Plan ahead. 1. Garden salad: not on the menu, but we figured we were having so many animal parts this was probably a good idea. $15 for generic salad. The salad was fresh but basic. 2. Mushroom risotto: this dish is very expensive for what it is, but you get a show. They come to your table with a large cheese bowl and add the risotto, mushroom, and even Canadian bacon. This dish had potential but was much too salty. It was hard to finish. 3. Terragon Bison tongue: this is tongue well done. The texture is very soft, which is impressive given the quality of most tongues. The sauces and everything just work well together. However, it's game-y so just be warned. 4. Foie gras poutine: loved it. The fries were good. The gravy was also good. The foie gras was in large blocks and was nice and fatty. I think if you come here, you should get this dish! 5. Duck in a Can: I loved watching them pour half a duck out of a can. Life experience. It even looked nice coming out. The duck came out as a thick filet attached to a flap of lard and also fatty liver (foie gras). I enjoyed this dish very much. It was over puréed cauliflower. The issue I had was that the duck meat was very thick. I had to eat it with slices of the lard to complement the taste. Overall a good dish. 6. Dessert: we got the maple cake and the lemon pie. Both were pretty good. Get the maple cake for novelty sake! Very sweet but good flavors. It was a pricy meal, but for a specialty restaurant it made sense.When my friend and I were certain we wanted to try Au Pied de Cochon, I tried to make reservation (1 week in advance) but their voicemail box was full... I didn't know what to do except, trying to call in the following days... And finally, 2 days before the date we wanted to go, I was finally able to make a reservation (but there weren't any tables left, and the lady asked me if it was okay to be seated at the counter/bar, which I was fine with).Being seated at the counter/bar was actually one exciting experience since we were able to watch the chefs cook and take a glance at all the dishes other customers ordered! It was really mind-blowing watching them cook in a fast-moving environment! I really liked their open-kitchen. It was also fun to guess whether the dish was ours or not too (it was our first time at Au Pied de Cochon, so we didn't know what to expect!)Before coming to Au Pied de Cochon, I searched other people's reviews and made my mind that I wanted to try their Duck in a Can! And this was one of the two dishes we ordered. We didn't know what to order next and my friend thought the The PDC Melting Pot has an interesting name, so we ordered that! Our waiter served us bread and butter (we didn't eat a lot since we wanted to save the tummy for our main courses, but the bread was not too hard, it was perfect!)Duck in a Can: Ordered it like I said because a lot of reviews said it is a must there! It is without doubt an interesting and fun dish. It came in a heated can (like how the name of the dish suggested). So, the waiter brought it over and opened it in front of you, poured the content out of the can (which contains the duck breast, 100g of foie gras, cabbages, the sauce) over the bread with carrot and cauliflower purée. The meat was really tender and it went very well with the cabbage, especially when you eat it with a small piece of duck meat. I actually really like the cabbage! It balanced the richness of the duck meat and foie gras very well. The fat under the duck meat was so chewy (I like chewy stuff) but the other fat part was.... I didn't like it since it was too greasy but some people like the feeling of fat melting in the mouth. We finished the dish (expect for the fat part) since it was too much for us.Duck in a can was quite an experience to be honest, it might not be my favorite dish due to its richness and especially oiliness but it was definitely an unique and interesting experience due to the presentation of the dish in a can!PDC Melting Pot:We actually preferred the melting pot because the taste wasn't as heavy as Duck in a Can and the pot was full of surprises, which made it more interesting. This dish came in a pot which was already hinted with its name! There was pork sausages, shiitake mushrooms, buttery potato cheese which was like mashed potatoes with cheese at the bottom, blood sausage -boudin but it is not like the Asian style one-, pork belly (so yummy!), pork loin and onions. There were a lot of things inside the pot; a lots of surprises! I absolutely loved the "buttery potato cheese", it was so delicious and well-made! The pork was tender and everything in this pot went extremely well with the mashed potatoes! The onion sauce was perfect too! It was a rich dish but not overwhelming like Duck in a Can.We also ordered their Milkshake XXX. My thought of my first sip: this is quite sweet... But afterwards, it got better! I don't know what was inside this milkshake... It tasted like rum (I'm not sure if it contained alcohol though). This was one rich milkshake I would say!We were basically in a food coma after this! I would definitely like to come back again and try their bison tongue (saw good reviews about it!)P.S: Make sure to make a reservation!!! Keep on trying even when their voicemail box is full!Service is outstanding. The employees are so attentive and seem to really love their jobs. Food it also outstanding and some of the best I have had in Montreal. I will say the food is really heavy and I don't want to think about the fat and calories. You'll probably walk out having eaten 2000 calories and well over 50 grams of fat, per person. Then again, if you really care about that stuff, subways right around the corner. Treat yourself, check it out. You will not be disappointed.We came to celebrate my husband's birthday. We reserved via email. It's the easiest way. I highly recommend reserving this way. I do not recommend going on Sunday's. They're out of everything. They were out of a few items. I didn't care for some, but being out of Ribs, Sweetbread, and BEER?! That was very disappointing. I ended up getting the famous Duck in a Can. Great flavour. Very delicious. Duck cooked to perfection. Then the Ragout. I liked the texture and how all the ingredients complimented each other, but it was wayyy too salty. I loved how it was prepared in a cheese block in front of us. Our waitress was rude and short with everything. Uninformative. We felt very rushed by her. Pretty much everything sucked but the Duck in a Can. I will come back and perhaps the experience will be better to tie with the good food.One of the best restaurants I have ever been to (if not the best).I had the duck in a can and my friend the risotto.The risotto is mixed in inside a large parmeggiano cheesw block and the duck is cooked inside the can for 27 minutes to a perfect taste.What an experienceService was great too!!Ouff getting a reservation at au PdeC was not an easy task ... who still operates over voicemail? Especially over a voicemail box that is always full?!But au PdeC still seems to get away with it thanks to all the hype Anthony Bourdain created during his 24 hour Montreal layover (if you've never watched it: dailymotion.com/.../xo2k…...).Needless to say, we had to try it out ourselves or we couldn't be called true Montrealers. But the overwhelming foie gras stuffed courses were too much for two people to handle, so we brought 2 friends for back up! All in all, if you come knowing that this will not be a fine dining experience and that you WILL be overindulging in rich and heavy courses, then your experience will be a satisfying one. And let's be honest, everything just tastes better with fat!From the foie gras stuffed croquettes that just ooze in your mouth as you bite into them, to the decadent poutine topped with foie gras gravy and a whole piece of foie gras and then the squash risotto cooked in a whole wheel of parmesan...! Your reward center will be firing away happy signals for hours to come smile emoticonAll this goodness, paired with a nice bottle of french wine (they have an extensive french heavy wine list and some good beer on tap) made this a highly enjoyable 'tourist in your own city experience'. Good food, good wine and great company along with a surprisingly affordable tab... what's not to like?Heard lots of great reviews for Au Pied de Cochon. This restaurant was featured on one of the shows by Anthony Bourdain! Service was excellent.DRINKS:Pied de Cochon beer x 2TERRAINE OF FOIE GRAS (4/5)Came with jam and bread. So delicious - it's pure foie gras. The taste is very strong and flavourful. A must for foie gras lovers :) I actually enjoyed this dish better without adding the jam on my slice of bread.FOIE GRAS POUTINE (5/5)A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! The closer you are to Montreal, the better the poutine gets and this one is a 5-star poutine for sure! Large slices of foie gras and big chunks of cheese.. mm fatty good!DUCK IN A CAN (5/5)So creative! It's a mini show when the waiter comes over and open the can in front of us (I recorded it all haha). The duck meat was tender and juicy - delicious. I would order this again the next time I visit Au Pied de Cochon.This place is the epitome of French Canadian cuisine. If you want an authentic Canadian culinary experience then this is not to be missed. The food is not for the faint of hearts and definitely leave your vegetarian friends at home. I wouldn't say this is a good everyday-go-to kinda restaurant so come here when you have visitors from out of town or for a special occasion. On to our meal. After cleansing our palettes with foie gras croquettes, we were ready for our main event. We bravely ordered the whole pig's head for two and I can say that it has been one of my most memorable meals. The head of pig was roasted to glistening perfection. Paired with apple and root veggies, the whole plate was full of flavour and tender juicy porky deliciousness. Since they have an open kitchen, people took pictures of our food as it made its way towards our table. It was quite the show! Have to admit I couldn't eat pork for a couple of weeks after but it was definitely worth every bite. Eating at Au Pied is a special event you don't want to miss.Do you love ducks? Or better yet, do you hate ducks? To the point where you'll eat ducks in every form for 3 different dishes? If so, Au Pied de Cochon is just what the doctor ordered.Sure, the name translates to the pig's feet, but the duck is where it's at.Foie gras poutine is about as rich and delicious as it sounds.The duck in a can (which COMES WITH FOIE GRAS) is also a must. Just watching the waiter take a can opener to it and drop it onto a plate is a thing of beauty. The entire can is boiled and then brought out. All the spices are infused and all the fattiness is preserved without getting boiled off. Super unique. Just don't overdo it. One can is probably enough for 3-4 people unless you REALLY want to feel unhealthy.We also got a side of duck fat fries, because WHY THE HELL NOT?There were 8 of us, so we did a few other entrees as well. One was the PDC's cut, which the waiter told us was a boneless pork chop (there was a bone). It looked dry, but it was actually incredibly moist. It was a gigantic hunk of meat too.We also did one of the specials - the Ahi tuna steak for two. Let me tell you, it was NOT for two. Maybe if you fasted and that was the only thing you ate that day. But it was also good. Perfectly rare, with a ton of veggies and cheese on the side. It was probably our least favorite of the dishes, but even still, it was very well done.We were seated all the way in the back by the wine cellar, so it was a bit of a tight squeeze (especially with another large group next to us), but there wasn't much else to complain about. They also have one hell of a wine list.Our waiter was super cool and gave us shots to round out the night.Probably one of the best meals I've ever had. Also, why I came back to the States with none of pants fitting anymore.Make reservations! Either call/email or reserve online. It's a must. Also come hungry, because, they serve a lot of food.This place gets super packed during the dinner rush. Even dining at the counter gets full.I'd recommend the foie gras duo to get the best out of APC. If you're dining with friends, then I'm sure you can taste each other's food. But for a single diner like myself, the foie gras duo comes with Foie Gras burger and foie gras poutine fries. Huge portions for about $50. Very fatty, very rich, and very good.I started off with the tuna tartare as an appetizer, but even though it is a small portion, I couldn't get through my foie gras duo because of the enormity of the portions. The tuna tartare was tarty and fresh.And I still wanted dessert after and I chose the toffee maple milk shake. They made it right in front me...I guess because I was in the counter, but you can see all the fatty goodness when they make this. Not to sweet, but I had enough room to finish it. I would order this again.Trying to find street parking might be hard for you during dinner time. And the metro station is several blocks away. You can probably try the bixi bikes if you have time to roam around this part of the Montreal neighborhood.Drip Drip Drip4 star for food and service but -0.5 star for all the water dripping from the vent on top of my head all through my dinner.Drip Drip Dip I know it was one of the hottest weekend in Montreal. It was end of July after all and I should be thankful for the nice cool interior of the restaurant with their AC on full blast. But with the water dripping on me the whole time (2 hour) while I was enjoying my dinner was not cool. The staff was all trying their best to stop the dripping from top of the AC vent which ran across the full depth of the restaurant by a squeegee sponge but it was not working....Drip Drip DripDinner was really good!! Excellent!We shared Tarragon Bison Tongue ($8.50) - I just love the Cornichon in that! And now I have a bottle in my fridge at home!Pâté de Campagne ($9) - So smooth and rich!Duck Carpaccio ($14) - Well seasoned, my first time having duck carpaccioDuck in a Can ($44) - So overhyped! The duck was dry and just not good! Foie Gras was so so. I don't believe I said that but I preferred mine seared...Braised Pig Feet with Side Pasta ($50) Seasonal - Must Order!! It was so tender and flavoured!! And the pasta which was prepared table side was so good! Perfect al dente and with BACON... Drip Drip DripI would have up my star to a 4 because the food was just amazing and the service was excellent. But the management really need to do something about their cooling system. I definitely would be back! PS The reservation system just got so much better as my reservation was confirmed by email and no need to play phone tag again!We had the foie gras poutine, stuffed pied de cochon with foie gras and a tuna dish.

The texture is very soft, which is impressive given the quality of most tongues. The sauces and everything just work well together. However, it's game-y so just be warned. 4. Foie gras poutine: loved it. The fries were good. The gravy was also good. The foie gras was in large blocks and was nice and fatty. I think if you come here, you should get this dish! 5. Duck in a Can: I loved watching them pour half a duck out of a can. Life experience. It even looked nice coming out. The duck came out as a thick filet attached to a flap of lard and also fatty liver (foie gras). I enjoyed this dish very much. It was over puréed cauliflower. The issue I had was that the duck meat was very thick. I had to eat it with slices of the lard to complement the taste. Overall a good dish. 6. Dessert: we got the maple cake and the lemon pie. Both were pretty good. Get the maple cake for novelty sake! Very sweet but good flavors. It was a pricy meal, but for a specialty restaurant it made sense.When my friend and I were certain we wanted to try Au Pied de Cochon, I tried to make reservation (1 week in advance) but their voicemail box was full... I didn't know what to do except, trying to call in the following days... And finally, 2 days before the date we wanted to go, I was finally able to make a reservation (but there weren't any tables left, and the lady asked me if it was okay to be seated at the counter/bar, which I was fine with).Being seated at the counter/bar was actually one exciting experience since we were able to watch the chefs cook and take a glance at all the dishes other customers ordered! It was really mind-blowing watching them cook in a fast-moving environment! I really liked their open-kitchen. It was also fun to guess whether the dish was ours or not too (it was our first time at Au Pied de Cochon, so we didn't know what to expect!)Before coming to Au Pied de Cochon, I searched other people's reviews and made my mind that I wanted to try their Duck in a Can! And this was one of the two dishes we ordered. We didn't know what to order next and my friend thought the The PDC Melting Pot has an interesting name, so we ordered that! Our waiter served us bread and butter (we didn't eat a lot since we wanted to save the tummy for our main courses, but the bread was not too hard, it was perfect!)Duck in a Can: Ordered it like I said because a lot of reviews said it is a must there! It is without doubt an interesting and fun dish. It came in a heated can (like how the name of the dish suggested). So, the waiter brought it over and opened it in front of you, poured the content out of the can (which contains the duck breast, 100g of foie gras, cabbages, the sauce) over the bread with carrot and cauliflower purée. The meat was really tender and it went very well with the cabbage, especially when you eat it with a small piece of duck meat. I actually really like the cabbage! It balanced the richness of the duck meat and foie gras very well. The fat under the duck meat was so chewy (I like chewy stuff) but the other fat part was.... I didn't like it since it was too greasy but some people like the feeling of fat melting in the mouth. We finished the dish (expect for the fat part) since it was too much for us.Duck in a can was quite an experience to be honest, it might not be my favorite dish due to its richness and especially oiliness but it was definitely an unique and interesting experience due to the presentation of the dish in a can!PDC Melting Pot:We actually preferred the melting pot because the taste wasn't as heavy as Duck in a Can and the pot was full of surprises, which made it more interesting. This dish came in a pot which was already hinted with its name! There was pork sausages, shiitake mushrooms, buttery potato cheese which was like mashed potatoes with cheese at the bottom, blood sausage -boudin but it is not like the Asian style one-, pork belly (so yummy!), pork loin and onions. There were a lot of things inside the pot; a lots of surprises! I absolutely loved the "buttery potato cheese", it was so delicious and well-made! The pork was tender and everything in this pot went extremely well with the mashed potatoes! The onion sauce was perfect too! It was a rich dish but not overwhelming like Duck in a Can.We also ordered their Milkshake XXX. My thought of my first sip: this is quite sweet... But afterwards, it got better! I don't know what was inside this milkshake... It tasted like rum (I'm not sure if it contained alcohol though). This was one rich milkshake I would say!We were basically in a food coma after this! I would definitely like to come back again and try their bison tongue (saw good reviews about it!)P.S: Make sure to make a reservation!!! Keep on trying even when their voicemail box is full!Service is outstanding. The employees are so attentive and seem to really love their jobs. Food it also outstanding and some of the best I have had in Montreal. I will say the food is really heavy and I don't want to think about the fat and calories. You'll probably walk out having eaten 2000 calories and well over 50 grams of fat, per person. Then again, if you really care about that stuff, subways right around the corner. Treat yourself, check it out. You will not be disappointed.We came to celebrate my husband's birthday. We reserved via email. It's the easiest way. I highly recommend reserving this way. I do not recommend going on Sunday's. They're out of everything. They were out of a few items. I didn't care for some, but being out of Ribs, Sweetbread, and BEER?! That was very disappointing. I ended up getting the famous Duck in a Can. Great flavour. Very delicious. Duck cooked to perfection. Then the Ragout. I liked the texture and how all the ingredients complimented each other, but it was wayyy too salty. I loved how it was prepared in a cheese block in front of us. Our waitress was rude and short with everything. Uninformative. We felt very rushed by her. Pretty much everything sucked but the Duck in a Can. I will come back and perhaps the experience will be better to tie with the good food.One of the best restaurants I have ever been to (if not the best).I had the duck in a can and my friend the risotto.The risotto is mixed in inside a large parmeggiano cheesw block and the duck is cooked inside the can for 27 minutes to a perfect taste.What an experienceService was great too!!Ouff getting a reservation at au PdeC was not an easy task ... who still operates over voicemail? Especially over a voicemail box that is always full?!But au PdeC still seems to get away with it thanks to all the hype Anthony Bourdain created during his 24 hour Montreal layover (if you've never watched it: dailymotion.com/.../xo2k…...).Needless to say, we had to try it out ourselves or we couldn't be called true Montrealers. But the overwhelming foie gras stuffed courses were too much for two people to handle, so we brought 2 friends for back up! All in all, if you come knowing that this will not be a fine dining experience and that you WILL be overindulging in rich and heavy courses, then your experience will be a satisfying one. And let's be honest, everything just tastes better with fat!From the foie gras stuffed croquettes that just ooze in your mouth as you bite into them, to the decadent poutine topped with foie gras gravy and a whole piece of foie gras and then the squash risotto cooked in a whole wheel of parmesan...! Your reward center will be firing away happy signals for hours to come smile emoticonAll this goodness, paired with a nice bottle of french wine (they have an extensive french heavy wine list and some good beer on tap) made this a highly enjoyable 'tourist in your own city experience'. Good food, good wine and great company along with a surprisingly affordable tab... what's not to like?Heard lots of great reviews for Au Pied de Cochon. This restaurant was featured on one of the shows by Anthony Bourdain! Service was excellent.DRINKS:Pied de Cochon beer x 2TERRAINE OF FOIE GRAS (4/5)Came with jam and bread. So delicious - it's pure foie gras. The taste is very strong and flavourful. A must for foie gras lovers :) I actually enjoyed this dish better without adding the jam on my slice of bread.FOIE GRAS POUTINE (5/5)A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! The closer you are to Montreal, the better the poutine gets and this one is a 5-star poutine for sure! Large slices of foie gras and big chunks of cheese.. mm fatty good!DUCK IN A CAN (5/5)So creative! It's a mini show when the waiter comes over and open the can in front of us (I recorded it all haha). The duck meat was tender and juicy - delicious. I would order this again the next time I visit Au Pied de Cochon.This place is the epitome of French Canadian cuisine. If you want an authentic Canadian culinary experience then this is not to be missed. The food is not for the faint of hearts and definitely leave your vegetarian friends at home. I wouldn't say this is a good everyday-go-to kinda restaurant so come here when you have visitors from out of town or for a special occasion. On to our meal. After cleansing our palettes with foie gras croquettes, we were ready for our main event. We bravely ordered the whole pig's head for two and I can say that it has been one of my most memorable meals. The head of pig was roasted to glistening perfection. Paired with apple and root veggies, the whole plate was full of flavour and tender juicy porky deliciousness. Since they have an open kitchen, people took pictures of our food as it made its way towards our table. It was quite the show! Have to admit I couldn't eat pork for a couple of weeks after but it was definitely worth every bite. Eating at Au Pied is a special event you don't want to miss.Do you love ducks? Or better yet, do you hate ducks? To the point where you'll eat ducks in every form for 3 different dishes? If so, Au Pied de Cochon is just what the doctor ordered.Sure, the name translates to the pig's feet, but the duck is where it's at.Foie gras poutine is about as rich and delicious as it sounds.The duck in a can (which COMES WITH FOIE GRAS) is also a must. Just watching the waiter take a can opener to it and drop it onto a plate is a thing of beauty. The entire can is boiled and then brought out. All the spices are infused and all the fattiness is preserved without getting boiled off. Super unique. Just don't overdo it. One can is probably enough for 3-4 people unless you REALLY want to feel unhealthy.We also got a side of duck fat fries, because WHY THE HELL NOT?There were 8 of us, so we did a few other entrees as well. One was the PDC's cut, which the waiter told us was a boneless pork chop (there was a bone). It looked dry, but it was actually incredibly moist. It was a gigantic hunk of meat too.We also did one of the specials - the Ahi tuna steak for two. Let me tell you, it was NOT for two. Maybe if you fasted and that was the only thing you ate that day. But it was also good. Perfectly rare, with a ton of veggies and cheese on the side. It was probably our least favorite of the dishes, but even still, it was very well done.We were seated all the way in the back by the wine cellar, so it was a bit of a tight squeeze (especially with another large group next to us), but there wasn't much else to complain about. They also have one hell of a wine list.Our waiter was super cool and gave us shots to round out the night.Probably one of the best meals I've ever had. Also, why I came back to the States with none of pants fitting anymore.Make reservations! Either call/email or reserve online. It's a must. Also come hungry, because, they serve a lot of food.This place gets super packed during the dinner rush. Even dining at the counter gets full.I'd recommend the foie gras duo to get the best out of APC. If you're dining with friends, then I'm sure you can taste each other's food. But for a single diner like myself, the foie gras duo comes with Foie Gras burger and foie gras poutine fries. Huge portions for about $50. Very fatty, very rich, and very good.I started off with the tuna tartare as an appetizer, but even though it is a small portion, I couldn't get through my foie gras duo because of the enormity of the portions. The tuna tartare was tarty and fresh.And I still wanted dessert after and I chose the toffee maple milk shake. They made it right in front me...I guess because I was in the counter, but you can see all the fatty goodness when they make this. Not to sweet, but I had enough room to finish it. I would order this again.Trying to find street parking might be hard for you during dinner time. And the metro station is several blocks away. You can probably try the bixi bikes if you have time to roam around this part of the Montreal neighborhood.Drip Drip Drip4 star for food and service but -0.5 star for all the water dripping from the vent on top of my head all through my dinner.Drip Drip Dip I know it was one of the hottest weekend in Montreal. It was end of July after all and I should be thankful for the nice cool interior of the restaurant with their AC on full blast. But with the water dripping on me the whole time (2 hour) while I was enjoying my dinner was not cool. The staff was all trying their best to stop the dripping from top of the AC vent which ran across the full depth of the restaurant by a squeegee sponge but it was not working....Drip Drip DripDinner was really good!! Excellent!We shared Tarragon Bison Tongue ($8.50) - I just love the Cornichon in that! And now I have a bottle in my fridge at home!Pâté de Campagne ($9) - So smooth and rich!Duck Carpaccio ($14) - Well seasoned, my first time having duck carpaccioDuck in a Can ($44) - So overhyped! The duck was dry and just not good! Foie Gras was so so. I don't believe I said that but I preferred mine seared...Braised Pig Feet with Side Pasta ($50) Seasonal - Must Order!! It was so tender and flavoured!! And the pasta which was prepared table side was so good! Perfect al dente and with BACON... Drip Drip DripI would have up my star to a 4 because the food was just amazing and the service was excellent. But the management really need to do something about their cooling system. I definitely would be back! PS The reservation system just got so much better as my reservation was confirmed by email and no need to play phone tag again!We had the foie gras poutine, stuffed pied de cochon with foie gras and a tuna dish. All were very rich in flavor and will lead to a heart attack BUT worth every bite. Poutine- get it! after all it is a Canadian dishStuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras- this is large enough for 3-4 people to share, the best part about this dish was the MASHED POTATO, it is sooooooooo good! it has a different texture from the typical mushy mashed potato. Tuna dish- our waiter picked this for us so I don't know what it's called but it's a pretty good dish with gravy and mashed potato on the bottom but it was a little salty though. Overall, amazing FATTY French Canadian food.Very rich food. If you like your food too creamy or too buttery, then this is your type of food. Everything was just very heavy and I couldn't seem to finish the dish. The FG is actually not bad as this was my first time tasting it. Definitely not something I would typically eat but at least I tried it! Plogue Champlain $29Pork filet $30Fg hamburger $39Squash risotto $24Fg poutine $24Eel tart $14The place was jam packed and there's absolutely no room to move if you're sitting on the outside of the table. Service is slow because of how busy it is. Might take you 10min to get the attention of a waitress and another 10 for the bill. Overall definitely a place to try but not something I would do again as its not really my type of food fare.I am judging overall as a meal and the service. First off, the place doesnt have a banner so it is difficult to spot if you dont know where it is. Foie gras poutine. Very good, the foie gras melted in with the poutine and you were able to taste the foie gras. The texture or the plate was consistant, there was cheesy, crispy and then the foie gras made it very good. you were able to taste that the fries were fried in the duck fat and the gravy was creamy and rich. with that being said, a very good dish but will get heavy and sickening after you eat too much of it.Foie gras a la champlain. foie gras on top of a thick slice of bacon, on a bed of thin crispy potato pancake (like a thin hashbrown), topped with a generous amount of maple syrup sauce. First bite was veryyyyy good!! So cripsy from the potato, the bacon was thick and the foie gras was enhanced in this plate, the maple syrup sauce was a good amount of sweet and salty. But this is definitely not a plate you eat on your own, its best for sharing because after a while the taste and maple syrup is quite overwhelming. table side Squash risotto. risotto was cooked very well but since it was table side she made it in the a large parmesan cheese, mixed it all together. She over poured the chicken broth and the risotto became a soup. The waiter asked how it was and I told him honestly that I did not like it because it was too watery. He left then about 3-4 mins later he asked me "do you want me to take it to the chef to try it", well no obviously not! She should have known when she served it because it was clearly too watery. He knew I was unhappy and he was the one that was pushing for this squash risotto, he didnt do anything to make up for the bad dish. At a resto like that I would expect so much more. Overall, theres definitely better. I'm glad I tried it but I would not be returning.We made the reservation two weeks ago. Probably because it's weekday, we are the only customers at 5:00pm.We didn't drink alcohol, only a bottle of water. The water is in glass bottle, taste better than thesame brand in plastic bottle.Tarragon Bison Tongue is the first dish. The tongue is from beef. Mr. Tang said it's good. I prefer the pickle, since I didn't try the tongue.Catch of the day, we picked the smoked eel. It also served with a piece of veal bone, you can eat the marrow(not sure if it's this word...).Fg poutine is great, although foie gras is too greasy for me.The duck in a can is great too. The duck is juicy and fresh, also with blood. The veggie taste a bit sour, really savory.The one missing star is for the dessert. Both icecream and pecan pie are too sweet for me to enjoy.After much hype, I made it here with a few colleagues on a Wednesday evening. The place was absolutely hopping and hard to get into, but we made a reservation a few weeks in advance.Once inside we sat at the bar, which is by far the best seat in the house. It comes with a direct view of the kitchen and all the goodness the chefs are whipping up. We started out with the ham special for appetizer, which was delicious. It came with a baguette and butter which made it perfect. We then had some poutine, which was also quite good. It was definitely better quality than most poutine dishes. For the main course, I went aggressive and got a mixed bowl consisting of blood sausage, pork sausage, mushrooms and onions sitting on top of mashed potatoes. The dish was very good, but not the amazing experience I was hoping for. Spices could have been a little better, but make no mistake it was a very good dish.With its popular reputation, upbeat atmosphere and good food, this is definitely a place worth visiting when in town. They also have a really good bar with interesting drinks. Great overall experience.Delicious food and a must if you're in Montreal. Come in hungry bc you'll get a rich and hearty meal. We ordered the infamous duck in a can, mushroom tortellini (tonites special), the steamed dumplings & plogue a Champlain "foie gras breakfast" - which was the highlight of the night. buckwheat pancake,  thick Canadian bacon, potatoes and cheese topped with foie gras. I wish it was one of the earlier items delivered I would have enjoyed a few more bites. Would def come here with a group to be able to taste more items on the menu. It's a busy restaurant so do make reservations. We scored 9:30 pm reservations on a Sunday night and place was packed with ppl still coming in with reservations after us. Service was slow and we had a really long wait b/t entrees coming out. We didn't leave until after 11:30. Luckily for us, our toddler was still on California time and was cooperative.Visit Montreal for a weekend and made a reservation two weeks in advance. Not too hard: I left a voicemail and someone called me back the next day. Between my friend and I, we ordered:- cromesquis de foie gras, basically deep fried fg. For $4, it was worth it. - temaki tartare, tartare Japanese hand roll. They didn't have bison available and we were offered veal. I quite enjoyed the layers of flavour and texture. - carpaccio de canard, duck carpaccio. My second favorite of the night. - and finally, poutine au foie gras. I hate to say it but this was a bit of a disappointment. I'm a fan of fg but this didn't have the ah-ha for me. We went later in the evening and 2 of the 3 cocktails were already sold out. My reco would be to go early. We also had a lot of trouble finding this place late at night. You really have to know what the front looks like!If you love pork and foie gras, this place is heaven. Recommend getting the foie gras poutine and the duck in a can. We also ordered the onion soup, duck carpaccio and the dumplings.Onion soup - your standard cheesy onion soup done right. Super tasty. Foie gras Poutine - must get!! Abundance of extra buttery and fatty foie gras with fries and gravy. This is a heavy dish so great for sharing and having a cold beer. Duck carpaccio - the presentation of the dish was beautiful. Thinly slice duck with chives, raw mushrooms and a yolk. Duck in a can - must get as well! The waiter brings over the can and opens it in front of the table. The content of the can contains the small duck, foie gras, cabbage which is all poured over the bread with carrot purée. The meat was tender and succulent.The service was very good - our waiter was extremely nice and helpful in making suggestions. There are so many options to choose from so it's great if you come with a big group and share everything!This place is insanely delicious.  The restaurant is a bit tight on space but the kitchen is opened. You can actually hear the staff call out orders.  There are so many options that we probably over ordered for two people!! For starters, we had poutine with foie gras, duck carpaccio and beef tongue.  For entrees we had the duck in a can and the blood sausage tart.  The duck in the can was amazing! We totally over did it on the foie gras but you only live once! We had so much foodWe had to call ahead so the restaurant could accommodate our baby.I went with a southern French person to this restaurant but he did not completely agree with my assessment. Just a caveat. :-)We really wanted to try a Montreal special, as this place is very well known. This place has the famous foie gras poutine and Duck in a Can. We decided to all share to try a few more dishes. The baguette is good!The ambience is nice. We went right when it opened and there was a small line waiting. You cannot get seated if you have not made a reservation. Plan ahead. 1. Garden salad: not on the menu, but we figured we were having so many animal parts this was probably a good idea. $15 for generic salad. The salad was fresh but basic. 2. Mushroom risotto: this dish is very expensive for what it is, but you get a show. They come to your table with a large cheese bowl and add the risotto, mushroom, and even Canadian bacon. This dish had potential but was much too salty. It was hard to finish. 3. Terragon Bison tongue: this is tongue well done. The texture is very soft, which is impressive given the quality of most tongues. The sauces and everything just work well together. However, it's game-y so just be warned. 4. Foie gras poutine: loved it. The fries were good. The gravy was also good. The foie gras was in large blocks and was nice and fatty. I think if you come here, you should get this dish! 5. Duck in a Can: I loved watching them pour half a duck out of a can. Life experience. It even looked nice coming out. The duck came out as a thick filet attached to a flap of lard and also fatty liver (foie gras). I enjoyed this dish very much. It was over puréed cauliflower. The issue I had was that the duck meat was very thick. I had to eat it with slices of the lard to complement the taste. Overall a good dish. 6. Dessert: we got the maple cake and the lemon pie. Both were pretty good. Get the maple cake for novelty sake! Very sweet but good flavors.

Have to admit I couldn't eat pork for a couple of weeks after but it was definitely worth every bite. Eating at Au Pied is a special event you don't want to miss.Do you love ducks? Or better yet, do you hate ducks? To the point where you'll eat ducks in every form for 3 different dishes? If so, Au Pied de Cochon is just what the doctor ordered.Sure, the name translates to the pig's feet, but the duck is where it's at.Foie gras poutine is about as rich and delicious as it sounds.The duck in a can (which COMES WITH FOIE GRAS) is also a must. Just watching the waiter take a can opener to it and drop it onto a plate is a thing of beauty. The entire can is boiled and then brought out. All the spices are infused and all the fattiness is preserved without getting boiled off. Super unique. Just don't overdo it. One can is probably enough for 3-4 people unless you REALLY want to feel unhealthy.We also got a side of duck fat fries, because WHY THE HELL NOT?There were 8 of us, so we did a few other entrees as well. One was the PDC's cut, which the waiter told us was a boneless pork chop (there was a bone). It looked dry, but it was actually incredibly moist. It was a gigantic hunk of meat too.We also did one of the specials - the Ahi tuna steak for two. Let me tell you, it was NOT for two. Maybe if you fasted and that was the only thing you ate that day. But it was also good. Perfectly rare, with a ton of veggies and cheese on the side. It was probably our least favorite of the dishes, but even still, it was very well done.We were seated all the way in the back by the wine cellar, so it was a bit of a tight squeeze (especially with another large group next to us), but there wasn't much else to complain about. They also have one hell of a wine list.Our waiter was super cool and gave us shots to round out the night.Probably one of the best meals I've ever had. Also, why I came back to the States with none of pants fitting anymore.Make reservations! Either call/email or reserve online. It's a must. Also come hungry, because, they serve a lot of food.This place gets super packed during the dinner rush. Even dining at the counter gets full.I'd recommend the foie gras duo to get the best out of APC. If you're dining with friends, then I'm sure you can taste each other's food. But for a single diner like myself, the foie gras duo comes with Foie Gras burger and foie gras poutine fries. Huge portions for about $50. Very fatty, very rich, and very good.I started off with the tuna tartare as an appetizer, but even though it is a small portion, I couldn't get through my foie gras duo because of the enormity of the portions. The tuna tartare was tarty and fresh.And I still wanted dessert after and I chose the toffee maple milk shake. They made it right in front me...I guess because I was in the counter, but you can see all the fatty goodness when they make this. Not to sweet, but I had enough room to finish it. I would order this again.Trying to find street parking might be hard for you during dinner time. And the metro station is several blocks away. You can probably try the bixi bikes if you have time to roam around this part of the Montreal neighborhood.Drip Drip Drip4 star for food and service but -0.5 star for all the water dripping from the vent on top of my head all through my dinner.Drip Drip Dip I know it was one of the hottest weekend in Montreal. It was end of July after all and I should be thankful for the nice cool interior of the restaurant with their AC on full blast. But with the water dripping on me the whole time (2 hour) while I was enjoying my dinner was not cool. The staff was all trying their best to stop the dripping from top of the AC vent which ran across the full depth of the restaurant by a squeegee sponge but it was not working....Drip Drip DripDinner was really good!! Excellent!We shared Tarragon Bison Tongue ($8.50) - I just love the Cornichon in that! And now I have a bottle in my fridge at home!Pâté de Campagne ($9) - So smooth and rich!Duck Carpaccio ($14) - Well seasoned, my first time having duck carpaccioDuck in a Can ($44) - So overhyped! The duck was dry and just not good! Foie Gras was so so. I don't believe I said that but I preferred mine seared...Braised Pig Feet with Side Pasta ($50) Seasonal - Must Order!! It was so tender and flavoured!! And the pasta which was prepared table side was so good! Perfect al dente and with BACON... Drip Drip DripI would have up my star to a 4 because the food was just amazing and the service was excellent. But the management really need to do something about their cooling system. I definitely would be back! PS The reservation system just got so much better as my reservation was confirmed by email and no need to play phone tag again!We had the foie gras poutine, stuffed pied de cochon with foie gras and a tuna dish. All were very rich in flavor and will lead to a heart attack BUT worth every bite. Poutine- get it! after all it is a Canadian dishStuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras- this is large enough for 3-4 people to share, the best part about this dish was the MASHED POTATO, it is sooooooooo good! it has a different texture from the typical mushy mashed potato. Tuna dish- our waiter picked this for us so I don't know what it's called but it's a pretty good dish with gravy and mashed potato on the bottom but it was a little salty though. Overall, amazing FATTY French Canadian food.Very rich food. If you like your food too creamy or too buttery, then this is your type of food. Everything was just very heavy and I couldn't seem to finish the dish. The FG is actually not bad as this was my first time tasting it. Definitely not something I would typically eat but at least I tried it! Plogue Champlain $29Pork filet $30Fg hamburger $39Squash risotto $24Fg poutine $24Eel tart $14The place was jam packed and there's absolutely no room to move if you're sitting on the outside of the table. Service is slow because of how busy it is. Might take you 10min to get the attention of a waitress and another 10 for the bill. Overall definitely a place to try but not something I would do again as its not really my type of food fare.I am judging overall as a meal and the service. First off, the place doesnt have a banner so it is difficult to spot if you dont know where it is. Foie gras poutine. Very good, the foie gras melted in with the poutine and you were able to taste the foie gras. The texture or the plate was consistant, there was cheesy, crispy and then the foie gras made it very good. you were able to taste that the fries were fried in the duck fat and the gravy was creamy and rich. with that being said, a very good dish but will get heavy and sickening after you eat too much of it.Foie gras a la champlain. foie gras on top of a thick slice of bacon, on a bed of thin crispy potato pancake (like a thin hashbrown), topped with a generous amount of maple syrup sauce. First bite was veryyyyy good!! So cripsy from the potato, the bacon was thick and the foie gras was enhanced in this plate, the maple syrup sauce was a good amount of sweet and salty. But this is definitely not a plate you eat on your own, its best for sharing because after a while the taste and maple syrup is quite overwhelming. table side Squash risotto. risotto was cooked very well but since it was table side she made it in the a large parmesan cheese, mixed it all together. She over poured the chicken broth and the risotto became a soup. The waiter asked how it was and I told him honestly that I did not like it because it was too watery. He left then about 3-4 mins later he asked me "do you want me to take it to the chef to try it", well no obviously not! She should have known when she served it because it was clearly too watery. He knew I was unhappy and he was the one that was pushing for this squash risotto, he didnt do anything to make up for the bad dish. At a resto like that I would expect so much more. Overall, theres definitely better. I'm glad I tried it but I would not be returning.We made the reservation two weeks ago. Probably because it's weekday, we are the only customers at 5:00pm.We didn't drink alcohol, only a bottle of water. The water is in glass bottle, taste better than thesame brand in plastic bottle.Tarragon Bison Tongue is the first dish. The tongue is from beef. Mr. Tang said it's good. I prefer the pickle, since I didn't try the tongue.Catch of the day, we picked the smoked eel. It also served with a piece of veal bone, you can eat the marrow(not sure if it's this word...).Fg poutine is great, although foie gras is too greasy for me.The duck in a can is great too. The duck is juicy and fresh, also with blood. The veggie taste a bit sour, really savory.The one missing star is for the dessert. Both icecream and pecan pie are too sweet for me to enjoy.After much hype, I made it here with a few colleagues on a Wednesday evening. The place was absolutely hopping and hard to get into, but we made a reservation a few weeks in advance.Once inside we sat at the bar, which is by far the best seat in the house. It comes with a direct view of the kitchen and all the goodness the chefs are whipping up. We started out with the ham special for appetizer, which was delicious. It came with a baguette and butter which made it perfect. We then had some poutine, which was also quite good. It was definitely better quality than most poutine dishes. For the main course, I went aggressive and got a mixed bowl consisting of blood sausage, pork sausage, mushrooms and onions sitting on top of mashed potatoes. The dish was very good, but not the amazing experience I was hoping for. Spices could have been a little better, but make no mistake it was a very good dish.With its popular reputation, upbeat atmosphere and good food, this is definitely a place worth visiting when in town. They also have a really good bar with interesting drinks. Great overall experience.Delicious food and a must if you're in Montreal. Come in hungry bc you'll get a rich and hearty meal. We ordered the infamous duck in a can, mushroom tortellini (tonites special), the steamed dumplings & plogue a Champlain "foie gras breakfast" - which was the highlight of the night. buckwheat pancake,  thick Canadian bacon, potatoes and cheese topped with foie gras. I wish it was one of the earlier items delivered I would have enjoyed a few more bites. Would def come here with a group to be able to taste more items on the menu. It's a busy restaurant so do make reservations. We scored 9:30 pm reservations on a Sunday night and place was packed with ppl still coming in with reservations after us. Service was slow and we had a really long wait b/t entrees coming out. We didn't leave until after 11:30. Luckily for us, our toddler was still on California time and was cooperative.Visit Montreal for a weekend and made a reservation two weeks in advance. Not too hard: I left a voicemail and someone called me back the next day. Between my friend and I, we ordered:- cromesquis de foie gras, basically deep fried fg. For $4, it was worth it. - temaki tartare, tartare Japanese hand roll. They didn't have bison available and we were offered veal. I quite enjoyed the layers of flavour and texture. - carpaccio de canard, duck carpaccio. My second favorite of the night. - and finally, poutine au foie gras. I hate to say it but this was a bit of a disappointment. I'm a fan of fg but this didn't have the ah-ha for me. We went later in the evening and 2 of the 3 cocktails were already sold out. My reco would be to go early. We also had a lot of trouble finding this place late at night. You really have to know what the front looks like!If you love pork and foie gras, this place is heaven. Recommend getting the foie gras poutine and the duck in a can. We also ordered the onion soup, duck carpaccio and the dumplings.Onion soup - your standard cheesy onion soup done right. Super tasty. Foie gras Poutine - must get!! Abundance of extra buttery and fatty foie gras with fries and gravy. This is a heavy dish so great for sharing and having a cold beer. Duck carpaccio - the presentation of the dish was beautiful. Thinly slice duck with chives, raw mushrooms and a yolk. Duck in a can - must get as well! The waiter brings over the can and opens it in front of the table. The content of the can contains the small duck, foie gras, cabbage which is all poured over the bread with carrot purée. The meat was tender and succulent.The service was very good - our waiter was extremely nice and helpful in making suggestions. There are so many options to choose from so it's great if you come with a big group and share everything!This place is insanely delicious.  The restaurant is a bit tight on space but the kitchen is opened. You can actually hear the staff call out orders.  There are so many options that we probably over ordered for two people!! For starters, we had poutine with foie gras, duck carpaccio and beef tongue.  For entrees we had the duck in a can and the blood sausage tart.  The duck in the can was amazing! We totally over did it on the foie gras but you only live once! We had so much foodWe had to call ahead so the restaurant could accommodate our baby.I went with a southern French person to this restaurant but he did not completely agree with my assessment. Just a caveat. :-)We really wanted to try a Montreal special, as this place is very well known. This place has the famous foie gras poutine and Duck in a Can. We decided to all share to try a few more dishes. The baguette is good!The ambience is nice. We went right when it opened and there was a small line waiting. You cannot get seated if you have not made a reservation. Plan ahead. 1. Garden salad: not on the menu, but we figured we were having so many animal parts this was probably a good idea. $15 for generic salad. The salad was fresh but basic. 2. Mushroom risotto: this dish is very expensive for what it is, but you get a show. They come to your table with a large cheese bowl and add the risotto, mushroom, and even Canadian bacon. This dish had potential but was much too salty. It was hard to finish. 3. Terragon Bison tongue: this is tongue well done. The texture is very soft, which is impressive given the quality of most tongues. The sauces and everything just work well together. However, it's game-y so just be warned. 4. Foie gras poutine: loved it. The fries were good. The gravy was also good. The foie gras was in large blocks and was nice and fatty. I think if you come here, you should get this dish! 5. Duck in a Can: I loved watching them pour half a duck out of a can. Life experience. It even looked nice coming out. The duck came out as a thick filet attached to a flap of lard and also fatty liver (foie gras). I enjoyed this dish very much. It was over puréed cauliflower. The issue I had was that the duck meat was very thick. I had to eat it with slices of the lard to complement the taste. Overall a good dish. 6. Dessert: we got the maple cake and the lemon pie. Both were pretty good. Get the maple cake for novelty sake! Very sweet but good flavors. It was a pricy meal, but for a specialty restaurant it made sense.When my friend and I were certain we wanted to try Au Pied de Cochon, I tried to make reservation (1 week in advance) but their voicemail box was full... I didn't know what to do except, trying to call in the following days... And finally, 2 days before the date we wanted to go, I was finally able to make a reservation (but there weren't any tables left, and the lady asked me if it was okay to be seated at the counter/bar, which I was fine with).Being seated at the counter/bar was actually one exciting experience since we were able to watch the chefs cook and take a glance at all the dishes other customers ordered! It was really mind-blowing watching them cook in a fast-moving environment! I really liked their open-kitchen. It was also fun to guess whether the dish was ours or not too (it was our first time at Au Pied de Cochon, so we didn't know what to expect!)Before coming to Au Pied de Cochon, I searched other people's reviews and made my mind that I wanted to try their Duck in a Can! And this was one of the two dishes we ordered. We didn't know what to order next and my friend thought the The PDC Melting Pot has an interesting name, so we ordered that! Our waiter served us bread and butter (we didn't eat a lot since we wanted to save the tummy for our main courses, but the bread was not too hard, it was perfect!)Duck in a Can: Ordered it like I said because a lot of reviews said it is a must there! It is without doubt an interesting and fun dish. It came in a heated can (like how the name of the dish suggested). So, the waiter brought it over and opened it in front of you, poured the content out of the can (which contains the duck breast, 100g of foie gras, cabbages, the sauce) over the bread with carrot and cauliflower purée. The meat was really tender and it went very well with the cabbage, especially when you eat it with a small piece of duck meat. I actually really like the cabbage! It balanced the richness of the duck meat and foie gras very well. The fat under the duck meat was so chewy (I like chewy stuff) but the other fat part was.... I didn't like it since it was too greasy but some people like the feeling of fat melting in the mouth. We finished the dish (expect for the fat part) since it was too much for us.Duck in a can was quite an experience to be honest, it might not be my favorite dish due to its richness and especially oiliness but it was definitely an unique and interesting experience due to the presentation of the dish in a can!PDC Melting Pot:We actually preferred the melting pot because the taste wasn't as heavy as Duck in a Can and the pot was full of surprises, which made it more interesting. This dish came in a pot which was already hinted with its name! There was pork sausages, shiitake mushrooms, buttery potato cheese which was like mashed potatoes with cheese at the bottom, blood sausage -boudin but it is not like the Asian style one-, pork belly (so yummy!), pork loin and onions. There were a lot of things inside the pot; a lots of surprises! I absolutely loved the "buttery potato cheese", it was so delicious and well-made! The pork was tender and everything in this pot went extremely well with the mashed potatoes! The onion sauce was perfect too! It was a rich dish but not overwhelming like Duck in a Can.We also ordered their Milkshake XXX. My thought of my first sip: this is quite sweet... But afterwards, it got better! I don't know what was inside this milkshake... It tasted like rum (I'm not sure if it contained alcohol though). This was one rich milkshake I would say!We were basically in a food coma after this! I would definitely like to come back again and try their bison tongue (saw good reviews about it!)P.S: Make sure to make a reservation!!! Keep on trying even when their voicemail box is full!Service is outstanding. The employees are so attentive and seem to really love their jobs. Food it also outstanding and some of the best I have had in Montreal. I will say the food is really heavy and I don't want to think about the fat and calories. You'll probably walk out having eaten 2000 calories and well over 50 grams of fat, per person. Then again, if you really care about that stuff, subways right around the corner. Treat yourself, check it out. You will not be disappointed.We came to celebrate my husband's birthday. We reserved via email. It's the easiest way. I highly recommend reserving this way. I do not recommend going on Sunday's. They're out of everything. They were out of a few items. I didn't care for some, but being out of Ribs, Sweetbread, and BEER?! That was very disappointing. I ended up getting the famous Duck in a Can. Great flavour. Very delicious. Duck cooked to perfection. Then the Ragout. I liked the texture and how all the ingredients complimented each other, but it was wayyy too salty. I loved how it was prepared in a cheese block in front of us. Our waitress was rude and short with everything. Uninformative. We felt very rushed by her. Pretty much everything sucked but the Duck in a Can. I will come back and perhaps the experience will be better to tie with the good food.One of the best restaurants I have ever been to (if not the best).I had the duck in a can and my friend the risotto.The risotto is mixed in inside a large parmeggiano cheesw block and the duck is cooked inside the can for 27 minutes to a perfect taste.What an experienceService was great too!!Ouff getting a reservation at au PdeC was not an easy task ... who still operates over voicemail? Especially over a voicemail box that is always full?!But au PdeC still seems to get away with it thanks to all the hype Anthony Bourdain created during his 24 hour Montreal layover (if you've never watched it: dailymotion.com/.../xo2k…...).Needless to say, we had to try it out ourselves or we couldn't be called true Montrealers. But the overwhelming foie gras stuffed courses were too much for two people to handle, so we brought 2 friends for back up! All in all, if you come knowing that this will not be a fine dining experience and that you WILL be overindulging in rich and heavy courses, then your experience will be a satisfying one. And let's be honest, everything just tastes better with fat!From the foie gras stuffed croquettes that just ooze in your mouth as you bite into them, to the decadent poutine topped with foie gras gravy and a whole piece of foie gras and then the squash risotto cooked in a whole wheel of parmesan...! Your reward center will be firing away happy signals for hours to come smile emoticonAll this goodness, paired with a nice bottle of french wine (they have an extensive french heavy wine list and some good beer on tap) made this a highly enjoyable 'tourist in your own city experience'. Good food, good wine and great company along with a surprisingly affordable tab... what's not to like?Heard lots of great reviews for Au Pied de Cochon. This restaurant was featured on one of the shows by Anthony Bourdain! Service was excellent.DRINKS:Pied de Cochon beer x 2TERRAINE OF FOIE GRAS (4/5)Came with jam and bread. So delicious - it's pure foie gras. The taste is very strong and flavourful. A must for foie gras lovers :) I actually enjoyed this dish better without adding the jam on my slice of bread.FOIE GRAS POUTINE (5/5)A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! The closer you are to Montreal, the better the poutine gets and this one is a 5-star poutine for sure! Large slices of foie gras and big chunks of cheese.. mm fatty good!DUCK IN A CAN (5/5)So creative! It's a mini show when the waiter comes over and open the can in front of us (I recorded it all haha). The duck meat was tender and juicy - delicious. I would order this again the next time I visit Au Pied de Cochon.This place is the epitome of French Canadian cuisine. If you want an authentic Canadian culinary experience then this is not to be missed. The food is not for the faint of hearts and definitely leave your vegetarian friends at home. I wouldn't say this is a good everyday-go-to kinda restaurant so come here when you have visitors from out of town or for a special occasion. On to our meal. After cleansing our palettes with foie gras croquettes, we were ready for our main event. We bravely ordered the whole pig's head for two and I can say that it has been one of my most memorable meals. The head of pig was roasted to glistening perfection. Paired with apple and root veggies, the whole plate was full of flavour and tender juicy porky deliciousness. Since they have an open kitchen, people took pictures of our food as it made its way towards our table. It was quite the show! Have to admit I couldn't eat pork for a couple of weeks after but it was definitely worth every bite. Eating at Au Pied is a special event you don't want to miss.Do you love ducks? Or better yet, do you hate ducks? To the point where you'll eat ducks in every form for 3 different dishes?

It came with a baguette and butter which made it perfect. We then had some poutine, which was also quite good. It was definitely better quality than most poutine dishes. For the main course, I went aggressive and got a mixed bowl consisting of blood sausage, pork sausage, mushrooms and onions sitting on top of mashed potatoes. The dish was very good, but not the amazing experience I was hoping for. Spices could have been a little better, but make no mistake it was a very good dish.With its popular reputation, upbeat atmosphere and good food, this is definitely a place worth visiting when in town. They also have a really good bar with interesting drinks. Great overall experience.Delicious food and a must if you're in Montreal. Come in hungry bc you'll get a rich and hearty meal. We ordered the infamous duck in a can, mushroom tortellini (tonites special), the steamed dumplings & plogue a Champlain "foie gras breakfast" - which was the highlight of the night. buckwheat pancake,  thick Canadian bacon, potatoes and cheese topped with foie gras. I wish it was one of the earlier items delivered I would have enjoyed a few more bites. Would def come here with a group to be able to taste more items on the menu. It's a busy restaurant so do make reservations. We scored 9:30 pm reservations on a Sunday night and place was packed with ppl still coming in with reservations after us. Service was slow and we had a really long wait b/t entrees coming out. We didn't leave until after 11:30. Luckily for us, our toddler was still on California time and was cooperative.Visit Montreal for a weekend and made a reservation two weeks in advance. Not too hard: I left a voicemail and someone called me back the next day. Between my friend and I, we ordered:- cromesquis de foie gras, basically deep fried fg. For $4, it was worth it. - temaki tartare, tartare Japanese hand roll. They didn't have bison available and we were offered veal. I quite enjoyed the layers of flavour and texture. - carpaccio de canard, duck carpaccio. My second favorite of the night. - and finally, poutine au foie gras. I hate to say it but this was a bit of a disappointment. I'm a fan of fg but this didn't have the ah-ha for me. We went later in the evening and 2 of the 3 cocktails were already sold out. My reco would be to go early. We also had a lot of trouble finding this place late at night. You really have to know what the front looks like!If you love pork and foie gras, this place is heaven. Recommend getting the foie gras poutine and the duck in a can. We also ordered the onion soup, duck carpaccio and the dumplings.Onion soup - your standard cheesy onion soup done right. Super tasty. Foie gras Poutine - must get!! Abundance of extra buttery and fatty foie gras with fries and gravy. This is a heavy dish so great for sharing and having a cold beer. Duck carpaccio - the presentation of the dish was beautiful. Thinly slice duck with chives, raw mushrooms and a yolk. Duck in a can - must get as well! The waiter brings over the can and opens it in front of the table. The content of the can contains the small duck, foie gras, cabbage which is all poured over the bread with carrot purée. The meat was tender and succulent.The service was very good - our waiter was extremely nice and helpful in making suggestions. There are so many options to choose from so it's great if you come with a big group and share everything!This place is insanely delicious.  The restaurant is a bit tight on space but the kitchen is opened. You can actually hear the staff call out orders.  There are so many options that we probably over ordered for two people!! For starters, we had poutine with foie gras, duck carpaccio and beef tongue.  For entrees we had the duck in a can and the blood sausage tart.  The duck in the can was amazing! We totally over did it on the foie gras but you only live once! We had so much foodWe had to call ahead so the restaurant could accommodate our baby.I went with a southern French person to this restaurant but he did not completely agree with my assessment. Just a caveat. :-)We really wanted to try a Montreal special, as this place is very well known. This place has the famous foie gras poutine and Duck in a Can. We decided to all share to try a few more dishes. The baguette is good!The ambience is nice. We went right when it opened and there was a small line waiting. You cannot get seated if you have not made a reservation. Plan ahead. 1. Garden salad: not on the menu, but we figured we were having so many animal parts this was probably a good idea. $15 for generic salad. The salad was fresh but basic. 2. Mushroom risotto: this dish is very expensive for what it is, but you get a show. They come to your table with a large cheese bowl and add the risotto, mushroom, and even Canadian bacon. This dish had potential but was much too salty. It was hard to finish. 3. Terragon Bison tongue: this is tongue well done. The texture is very soft, which is impressive given the quality of most tongues. The sauces and everything just work well together. However, it's game-y so just be warned. 4. Foie gras poutine: loved it. The fries were good. The gravy was also good. The foie gras was in large blocks and was nice and fatty. I think if you come here, you should get this dish! 5. Duck in a Can: I loved watching them pour half a duck out of a can. Life experience. It even looked nice coming out. The duck came out as a thick filet attached to a flap of lard and also fatty liver (foie gras). I enjoyed this dish very much. It was over puréed cauliflower. The issue I had was that the duck meat was very thick. I had to eat it with slices of the lard to complement the taste. Overall a good dish. 6. Dessert: we got the maple cake and the lemon pie. Both were pretty good. Get the maple cake for novelty sake! Very sweet but good flavors. It was a pricy meal, but for a specialty restaurant it made sense.When my friend and I were certain we wanted to try Au Pied de Cochon, I tried to make reservation (1 week in advance) but their voicemail box was full... I didn't know what to do except, trying to call in the following days... And finally, 2 days before the date we wanted to go, I was finally able to make a reservation (but there weren't any tables left, and the lady asked me if it was okay to be seated at the counter/bar, which I was fine with).Being seated at the counter/bar was actually one exciting experience since we were able to watch the chefs cook and take a glance at all the dishes other customers ordered! It was really mind-blowing watching them cook in a fast-moving environment! I really liked their open-kitchen. It was also fun to guess whether the dish was ours or not too (it was our first time at Au Pied de Cochon, so we didn't know what to expect!)Before coming to Au Pied de Cochon, I searched other people's reviews and made my mind that I wanted to try their Duck in a Can! And this was one of the two dishes we ordered. We didn't know what to order next and my friend thought the The PDC Melting Pot has an interesting name, so we ordered that! Our waiter served us bread and butter (we didn't eat a lot since we wanted to save the tummy for our main courses, but the bread was not too hard, it was perfect!)Duck in a Can: Ordered it like I said because a lot of reviews said it is a must there! It is without doubt an interesting and fun dish. It came in a heated can (like how the name of the dish suggested). So, the waiter brought it over and opened it in front of you, poured the content out of the can (which contains the duck breast, 100g of foie gras, cabbages, the sauce) over the bread with carrot and cauliflower purée. The meat was really tender and it went very well with the cabbage, especially when you eat it with a small piece of duck meat. I actually really like the cabbage! It balanced the richness of the duck meat and foie gras very well. The fat under the duck meat was so chewy (I like chewy stuff) but the other fat part was.... I didn't like it since it was too greasy but some people like the feeling of fat melting in the mouth. We finished the dish (expect for the fat part) since it was too much for us.Duck in a can was quite an experience to be honest, it might not be my favorite dish due to its richness and especially oiliness but it was definitely an unique and interesting experience due to the presentation of the dish in a can!PDC Melting Pot:We actually preferred the melting pot because the taste wasn't as heavy as Duck in a Can and the pot was full of surprises, which made it more interesting. This dish came in a pot which was already hinted with its name! There was pork sausages, shiitake mushrooms, buttery potato cheese which was like mashed potatoes with cheese at the bottom, blood sausage -boudin but it is not like the Asian style one-, pork belly (so yummy!), pork loin and onions. There were a lot of things inside the pot; a lots of surprises! I absolutely loved the "buttery potato cheese", it was so delicious and well-made! The pork was tender and everything in this pot went extremely well with the mashed potatoes! The onion sauce was perfect too! It was a rich dish but not overwhelming like Duck in a Can.We also ordered their Milkshake XXX. My thought of my first sip: this is quite sweet... But afterwards, it got better! I don't know what was inside this milkshake... It tasted like rum (I'm not sure if it contained alcohol though). This was one rich milkshake I would say!We were basically in a food coma after this! I would definitely like to come back again and try their bison tongue (saw good reviews about it!)P.S: Make sure to make a reservation!!! Keep on trying even when their voicemail box is full!Service is outstanding. The employees are so attentive and seem to really love their jobs. Food it also outstanding and some of the best I have had in Montreal. I will say the food is really heavy and I don't want to think about the fat and calories. You'll probably walk out having eaten 2000 calories and well over 50 grams of fat, per person. Then again, if you really care about that stuff, subways right around the corner. Treat yourself, check it out. You will not be disappointed.We came to celebrate my husband's birthday. We reserved via email. It's the easiest way. I highly recommend reserving this way. I do not recommend going on Sunday's. They're out of everything. They were out of a few items. I didn't care for some, but being out of Ribs, Sweetbread, and BEER?! That was very disappointing. I ended up getting the famous Duck in a Can. Great flavour. Very delicious. Duck cooked to perfection. Then the Ragout. I liked the texture and how all the ingredients complimented each other, but it was wayyy too salty. I loved how it was prepared in a cheese block in front of us. Our waitress was rude and short with everything. Uninformative. We felt very rushed by her. Pretty much everything sucked but the Duck in a Can. I will come back and perhaps the experience will be better to tie with the good food.One of the best restaurants I have ever been to (if not the best).I had the duck in a can and my friend the risotto.The risotto is mixed in inside a large parmeggiano cheesw block and the duck is cooked inside the can for 27 minutes to a perfect taste.What an experienceService was great too!!Ouff getting a reservation at au PdeC was not an easy task ... who still operates over voicemail? Especially over a voicemail box that is always full?!But au PdeC still seems to get away with it thanks to all the hype Anthony Bourdain created during his 24 hour Montreal layover (if you've never watched it: dailymotion.com/.../xo2k…...).Needless to say, we had to try it out ourselves or we couldn't be called true Montrealers. But the overwhelming foie gras stuffed courses were too much for two people to handle, so we brought 2 friends for back up! All in all, if you come knowing that this will not be a fine dining experience and that you WILL be overindulging in rich and heavy courses, then your experience will be a satisfying one. And let's be honest, everything just tastes better with fat!From the foie gras stuffed croquettes that just ooze in your mouth as you bite into them, to the decadent poutine topped with foie gras gravy and a whole piece of foie gras and then the squash risotto cooked in a whole wheel of parmesan...! Your reward center will be firing away happy signals for hours to come smile emoticonAll this goodness, paired with a nice bottle of french wine (they have an extensive french heavy wine list and some good beer on tap) made this a highly enjoyable 'tourist in your own city experience'. Good food, good wine and great company along with a surprisingly affordable tab... what's not to like?Heard lots of great reviews for Au Pied de Cochon. This restaurant was featured on one of the shows by Anthony Bourdain! Service was excellent.DRINKS:Pied de Cochon beer x 2TERRAINE OF FOIE GRAS (4/5)Came with jam and bread. So delicious - it's pure foie gras. The taste is very strong and flavourful. A must for foie gras lovers :) I actually enjoyed this dish better without adding the jam on my slice of bread.FOIE GRAS POUTINE (5/5)A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! The closer you are to Montreal, the better the poutine gets and this one is a 5-star poutine for sure! Large slices of foie gras and big chunks of cheese.. mm fatty good!DUCK IN A CAN (5/5)So creative! It's a mini show when the waiter comes over and open the can in front of us (I recorded it all haha). The duck meat was tender and juicy - delicious. I would order this again the next time I visit Au Pied de Cochon.This place is the epitome of French Canadian cuisine. If you want an authentic Canadian culinary experience then this is not to be missed. The food is not for the faint of hearts and definitely leave your vegetarian friends at home. I wouldn't say this is a good everyday-go-to kinda restaurant so come here when you have visitors from out of town or for a special occasion. On to our meal. After cleansing our palettes with foie gras croquettes, we were ready for our main event. We bravely ordered the whole pig's head for two and I can say that it has been one of my most memorable meals. The head of pig was roasted to glistening perfection. Paired with apple and root veggies, the whole plate was full of flavour and tender juicy porky deliciousness. Since they have an open kitchen, people took pictures of our food as it made its way towards our table. It was quite the show! Have to admit I couldn't eat pork for a couple of weeks after but it was definitely worth every bite. Eating at Au Pied is a special event you don't want to miss.Do you love ducks? Or better yet, do you hate ducks? To the point where you'll eat ducks in every form for 3 different dishes? If so, Au Pied de Cochon is just what the doctor ordered.Sure, the name translates to the pig's feet, but the duck is where it's at.Foie gras poutine is about as rich and delicious as it sounds.The duck in a can (which COMES WITH FOIE GRAS) is also a must. Just watching the waiter take a can opener to it and drop it onto a plate is a thing of beauty. The entire can is boiled and then brought out. All the spices are infused and all the fattiness is preserved without getting boiled off. Super unique. Just don't overdo it. One can is probably enough for 3-4 people unless you REALLY want to feel unhealthy.We also got a side of duck fat fries, because WHY THE HELL NOT?There were 8 of us, so we did a few other entrees as well. One was the PDC's cut, which the waiter told us was a boneless pork chop (there was a bone). It looked dry, but it was actually incredibly moist. It was a gigantic hunk of meat too.We also did one of the specials - the Ahi tuna steak for two. Let me tell you, it was NOT for two. Maybe if you fasted and that was the only thing you ate that day. But it was also good. Perfectly rare, with a ton of veggies and cheese on the side. It was probably our least favorite of the dishes, but even still, it was very well done.We were seated all the way in the back by the wine cellar, so it was a bit of a tight squeeze (especially with another large group next to us), but there wasn't much else to complain about. They also have one hell of a wine list.Our waiter was super cool and gave us shots to round out the night.Probably one of the best meals I've ever had. Also, why I came back to the States with none of pants fitting anymore.Make reservations! Either call/email or reserve online. It's a must. Also come hungry, because, they serve a lot of food.This place gets super packed during the dinner rush. Even dining at the counter gets full.I'd recommend the foie gras duo to get the best out of APC. If you're dining with friends, then I'm sure you can taste each other's food. But for a single diner like myself, the foie gras duo comes with Foie Gras burger and foie gras poutine fries. Huge portions for about $50. Very fatty, very rich, and very good.I started off with the tuna tartare as an appetizer, but even though it is a small portion, I couldn't get through my foie gras duo because of the enormity of the portions. The tuna tartare was tarty and fresh.And I still wanted dessert after and I chose the toffee maple milk shake. They made it right in front me...I guess because I was in the counter, but you can see all the fatty goodness when they make this. Not to sweet, but I had enough room to finish it. I would order this again.Trying to find street parking might be hard for you during dinner time. And the metro station is several blocks away. You can probably try the bixi bikes if you have time to roam around this part of the Montreal neighborhood.Drip Drip Drip4 star for food and service but -0.5 star for all the water dripping from the vent on top of my head all through my dinner.Drip Drip Dip I know it was one of the hottest weekend in Montreal. It was end of July after all and I should be thankful for the nice cool interior of the restaurant with their AC on full blast. But with the water dripping on me the whole time (2 hour) while I was enjoying my dinner was not cool. The staff was all trying their best to stop the dripping from top of the AC vent which ran across the full depth of the restaurant by a squeegee sponge but it was not working....Drip Drip DripDinner was really good!! Excellent!We shared Tarragon Bison Tongue ($8.50) - I just love the Cornichon in that! And now I have a bottle in my fridge at home!Pâté de Campagne ($9) - So smooth and rich!Duck Carpaccio ($14) - Well seasoned, my first time having duck carpaccioDuck in a Can ($44) - So overhyped! The duck was dry and just not good! Foie Gras was so so. I don't believe I said that but I preferred mine seared...Braised Pig Feet with Side Pasta ($50) Seasonal - Must Order!! It was so tender and flavoured!! And the pasta which was prepared table side was so good! Perfect al dente and with BACON... Drip Drip DripI would have up my star to a 4 because the food was just amazing and the service was excellent. But the management really need to do something about their cooling system. I definitely would be back! PS The reservation system just got so much better as my reservation was confirmed by email and no need to play phone tag again!We had the foie gras poutine, stuffed pied de cochon with foie gras and a tuna dish. All were very rich in flavor and will lead to a heart attack BUT worth every bite. Poutine- get it! after all it is a Canadian dishStuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras- this is large enough for 3-4 people to share, the best part about this dish was the MASHED POTATO, it is sooooooooo good! it has a different texture from the typical mushy mashed potato. Tuna dish- our waiter picked this for us so I don't know what it's called but it's a pretty good dish with gravy and mashed potato on the bottom but it was a little salty though. Overall, amazing FATTY French Canadian food.Very rich food. If you like your food too creamy or too buttery, then this is your type of food. Everything was just very heavy and I couldn't seem to finish the dish. The FG is actually not bad as this was my first time tasting it. Definitely not something I would typically eat but at least I tried it! Plogue Champlain $29Pork filet $30Fg hamburger $39Squash risotto $24Fg poutine $24Eel tart $14The place was jam packed and there's absolutely no room to move if you're sitting on the outside of the table. Service is slow because of how busy it is. Might take you 10min to get the attention of a waitress and another 10 for the bill. Overall definitely a place to try but not something I would do again as its not really my type of food fare.I am judging overall as a meal and the service. First off, the place doesnt have a banner so it is difficult to spot if you dont know where it is. Foie gras poutine. Very good, the foie gras melted in with the poutine and you were able to taste the foie gras. The texture or the plate was consistant, there was cheesy, crispy and then the foie gras made it very good. you were able to taste that the fries were fried in the duck fat and the gravy was creamy and rich. with that being said, a very good dish but will get heavy and sickening after you eat too much of it.Foie gras a la champlain. foie gras on top of a thick slice of bacon, on a bed of thin crispy potato pancake (like a thin hashbrown), topped with a generous amount of maple syrup sauce. First bite was veryyyyy good!! So cripsy from the potato, the bacon was thick and the foie gras was enhanced in this plate, the maple syrup sauce was a good amount of sweet and salty. But this is definitely not a plate you eat on your own, its best for sharing because after a while the taste and maple syrup is quite overwhelming. table side Squash risotto. risotto was cooked very well but since it was table side she made it in the a large parmesan cheese, mixed it all together. She over poured the chicken broth and the risotto became a soup. The waiter asked how it was and I told him honestly that I did not like it because it was too watery. He left then about 3-4 mins later he asked me "do you want me to take it to the chef to try it", well no obviously not! She should have known when she served it because it was clearly too watery. He knew I was unhappy and he was the one that was pushing for this squash risotto, he didnt do anything to make up for the bad dish. At a resto like that I would expect so much more. Overall, theres definitely better. I'm glad I tried it but I would not be returning.We made the reservation two weeks ago. Probably because it's weekday, we are the only customers at 5:00pm.We didn't drink alcohol, only a bottle of water. The water is in glass bottle, taste better than thesame brand in plastic bottle.Tarragon Bison Tongue is the first dish. The tongue is from beef. Mr. Tang said it's good. I prefer the pickle, since I didn't try the tongue.Catch of the day, we picked the smoked eel. It also served with a piece of veal bone, you can eat the marrow(not sure if it's this word...).Fg poutine is great, although foie gras is too greasy for me.The duck in a can is great too. The duck is juicy and fresh, also with blood. The veggie taste a bit sour, really savory.The one missing star is for the dessert. Both icecream and pecan pie are too sweet for me to enjoy.After much hype, I made it here with a few colleagues on a Wednesday evening. The place was absolutely hopping and hard to get into, but we made a reservation a few weeks in advance.Once inside we sat at the bar, which is by far the best seat in the house. It comes with a direct view of the kitchen and all the goodness the chefs are whipping up. We started out with the ham special for appetizer, which was delicious. It came with a baguette and butter which made it perfect. We then had some poutine, which was also quite good. It was definitely better quality than most poutine dishes.

I would definitely like to come back again and try their bison tongue (saw good reviews about it!)P.S: Make sure to make a reservation!!! Keep on trying even when their voicemail box is full!Service is outstanding. The employees are so attentive and seem to really love their jobs. Food it also outstanding and some of the best I have had in Montreal. I will say the food is really heavy and I don't want to think about the fat and calories. You'll probably walk out having eaten 2000 calories and well over 50 grams of fat, per person. Then again, if you really care about that stuff, subways right around the corner. Treat yourself, check it out. You will not be disappointed.We came to celebrate my husband's birthday. We reserved via email. It's the easiest way. I highly recommend reserving this way. I do not recommend going on Sunday's. They're out of everything. They were out of a few items. I didn't care for some, but being out of Ribs, Sweetbread, and BEER?! That was very disappointing. I ended up getting the famous Duck in a Can. Great flavour. Very delicious. Duck cooked to perfection. Then the Ragout. I liked the texture and how all the ingredients complimented each other, but it was wayyy too salty. I loved how it was prepared in a cheese block in front of us. Our waitress was rude and short with everything. Uninformative. We felt very rushed by her. Pretty much everything sucked but the Duck in a Can. I will come back and perhaps the experience will be better to tie with the good food.One of the best restaurants I have ever been to (if not the best).I had the duck in a can and my friend the risotto.The risotto is mixed in inside a large parmeggiano cheesw block and the duck is cooked inside the can for 27 minutes to a perfect taste.What an experienceService was great too!!Ouff getting a reservation at au PdeC was not an easy task ... who still operates over voicemail? Especially over a voicemail box that is always full?!But au PdeC still seems to get away with it thanks to all the hype Anthony Bourdain created during his 24 hour Montreal layover (if you've never watched it: dailymotion.com/.../xo2k…...).Needless to say, we had to try it out ourselves or we couldn't be called true Montrealers. But the overwhelming foie gras stuffed courses were too much for two people to handle, so we brought 2 friends for back up! All in all, if you come knowing that this will not be a fine dining experience and that you WILL be overindulging in rich and heavy courses, then your experience will be a satisfying one. And let's be honest, everything just tastes better with fat!From the foie gras stuffed croquettes that just ooze in your mouth as you bite into them, to the decadent poutine topped with foie gras gravy and a whole piece of foie gras and then the squash risotto cooked in a whole wheel of parmesan...! Your reward center will be firing away happy signals for hours to come smile emoticonAll this goodness, paired with a nice bottle of french wine (they have an extensive french heavy wine list and some good beer on tap) made this a highly enjoyable 'tourist in your own city experience'. Good food, good wine and great company along with a surprisingly affordable tab... what's not to like?Heard lots of great reviews for Au Pied de Cochon. This restaurant was featured on one of the shows by Anthony Bourdain! Service was excellent.DRINKS:Pied de Cochon beer x 2TERRAINE OF FOIE GRAS (4/5)Came with jam and bread. So delicious - it's pure foie gras. The taste is very strong and flavourful. A must for foie gras lovers :) I actually enjoyed this dish better without adding the jam on my slice of bread.FOIE GRAS POUTINE (5/5)A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! The closer you are to Montreal, the better the poutine gets and this one is a 5-star poutine for sure! Large slices of foie gras and big chunks of cheese.. mm fatty good!DUCK IN A CAN (5/5)So creative! It's a mini show when the waiter comes over and open the can in front of us (I recorded it all haha). The duck meat was tender and juicy - delicious. I would order this again the next time I visit Au Pied de Cochon.This place is the epitome of French Canadian cuisine. If you want an authentic Canadian culinary experience then this is not to be missed. The food is not for the faint of hearts and definitely leave your vegetarian friends at home. I wouldn't say this is a good everyday-go-to kinda restaurant so come here when you have visitors from out of town or for a special occasion. On to our meal. After cleansing our palettes with foie gras croquettes, we were ready for our main event. We bravely ordered the whole pig's head for two and I can say that it has been one of my most memorable meals. The head of pig was roasted to glistening perfection. Paired with apple and root veggies, the whole plate was full of flavour and tender juicy porky deliciousness. Since they have an open kitchen, people took pictures of our food as it made its way towards our table. It was quite the show! Have to admit I couldn't eat pork for a couple of weeks after but it was definitely worth every bite. Eating at Au Pied is a special event you don't want to miss.Do you love ducks? Or better yet, do you hate ducks? To the point where you'll eat ducks in every form for 3 different dishes? If so, Au Pied de Cochon is just what the doctor ordered.Sure, the name translates to the pig's feet, but the duck is where it's at.Foie gras poutine is about as rich and delicious as it sounds.The duck in a can (which COMES WITH FOIE GRAS) is also a must. Just watching the waiter take a can opener to it and drop it onto a plate is a thing of beauty. The entire can is boiled and then brought out. All the spices are infused and all the fattiness is preserved without getting boiled off. Super unique. Just don't overdo it. One can is probably enough for 3-4 people unless you REALLY want to feel unhealthy.We also got a side of duck fat fries, because WHY THE HELL NOT?There were 8 of us, so we did a few other entrees as well. One was the PDC's cut, which the waiter told us was a boneless pork chop (there was a bone). It looked dry, but it was actually incredibly moist. It was a gigantic hunk of meat too.We also did one of the specials - the Ahi tuna steak for two. Let me tell you, it was NOT for two. Maybe if you fasted and that was the only thing you ate that day. But it was also good. Perfectly rare, with a ton of veggies and cheese on the side. It was probably our least favorite of the dishes, but even still, it was very well done.We were seated all the way in the back by the wine cellar, so it was a bit of a tight squeeze (especially with another large group next to us), but there wasn't much else to complain about. They also have one hell of a wine list.Our waiter was super cool and gave us shots to round out the night.Probably one of the best meals I've ever had. Also, why I came back to the States with none of pants fitting anymore.Make reservations! Either call/email or reserve online. It's a must. Also come hungry, because, they serve a lot of food.This place gets super packed during the dinner rush. Even dining at the counter gets full.I'd recommend the foie gras duo to get the best out of APC. If you're dining with friends, then I'm sure you can taste each other's food. But for a single diner like myself, the foie gras duo comes with Foie Gras burger and foie gras poutine fries. Huge portions for about $50. Very fatty, very rich, and very good.I started off with the tuna tartare as an appetizer, but even though it is a small portion, I couldn't get through my foie gras duo because of the enormity of the portions. The tuna tartare was tarty and fresh.And I still wanted dessert after and I chose the toffee maple milk shake. They made it right in front me...I guess because I was in the counter, but you can see all the fatty goodness when they make this. Not to sweet, but I had enough room to finish it. I would order this again.Trying to find street parking might be hard for you during dinner time. And the metro station is several blocks away. You can probably try the bixi bikes if you have time to roam around this part of the Montreal neighborhood.Drip Drip Drip4 star for food and service but -0.5 star for all the water dripping from the vent on top of my head all through my dinner.Drip Drip Dip I know it was one of the hottest weekend in Montreal. It was end of July after all and I should be thankful for the nice cool interior of the restaurant with their AC on full blast. But with the water dripping on me the whole time (2 hour) while I was enjoying my dinner was not cool. The staff was all trying their best to stop the dripping from top of the AC vent which ran across the full depth of the restaurant by a squeegee sponge but it was not working....Drip Drip DripDinner was really good!! Excellent!We shared Tarragon Bison Tongue ($8.50) - I just love the Cornichon in that! And now I have a bottle in my fridge at home!Pâté de Campagne ($9) - So smooth and rich!Duck Carpaccio ($14) - Well seasoned, my first time having duck carpaccioDuck in a Can ($44) - So overhyped! The duck was dry and just not good! Foie Gras was so so. I don't believe I said that but I preferred mine seared...Braised Pig Feet with Side Pasta ($50) Seasonal - Must Order!! It was so tender and flavoured!! And the pasta which was prepared table side was so good! Perfect al dente and with BACON... Drip Drip DripI would have up my star to a 4 because the food was just amazing and the service was excellent. But the management really need to do something about their cooling system. I definitely would be back! PS The reservation system just got so much better as my reservation was confirmed by email and no need to play phone tag again!We had the foie gras poutine, stuffed pied de cochon with foie gras and a tuna dish. All were very rich in flavor and will lead to a heart attack BUT worth every bite. Poutine- get it! after all it is a Canadian dishStuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras- this is large enough for 3-4 people to share, the best part about this dish was the MASHED POTATO, it is sooooooooo good! it has a different texture from the typical mushy mashed potato. Tuna dish- our waiter picked this for us so I don't know what it's called but it's a pretty good dish with gravy and mashed potato on the bottom but it was a little salty though. Overall, amazing FATTY French Canadian food.Very rich food. If you like your food too creamy or too buttery, then this is your type of food. Everything was just very heavy and I couldn't seem to finish the dish. The FG is actually not bad as this was my first time tasting it. Definitely not something I would typically eat but at least I tried it! Plogue Champlain $29Pork filet $30Fg hamburger $39Squash risotto $24Fg poutine $24Eel tart $14The place was jam packed and there's absolutely no room to move if you're sitting on the outside of the table. Service is slow because of how busy it is. Might take you 10min to get the attention of a waitress and another 10 for the bill. Overall definitely a place to try but not something I would do again as its not really my type of food fare.I am judging overall as a meal and the service. First off, the place doesnt have a banner so it is difficult to spot if you dont know where it is. Foie gras poutine. Very good, the foie gras melted in with the poutine and you were able to taste the foie gras. The texture or the plate was consistant, there was cheesy, crispy and then the foie gras made it very good. you were able to taste that the fries were fried in the duck fat and the gravy was creamy and rich. with that being said, a very good dish but will get heavy and sickening after you eat too much of it.Foie gras a la champlain. foie gras on top of a thick slice of bacon, on a bed of thin crispy potato pancake (like a thin hashbrown), topped with a generous amount of maple syrup sauce. First bite was veryyyyy good!! So cripsy from the potato, the bacon was thick and the foie gras was enhanced in this plate, the maple syrup sauce was a good amount of sweet and salty. But this is definitely not a plate you eat on your own, its best for sharing because after a while the taste and maple syrup is quite overwhelming. table side Squash risotto. risotto was cooked very well but since it was table side she made it in the a large parmesan cheese, mixed it all together. She over poured the chicken broth and the risotto became a soup. The waiter asked how it was and I told him honestly that I did not like it because it was too watery. He left then about 3-4 mins later he asked me "do you want me to take it to the chef to try it", well no obviously not! She should have known when she served it because it was clearly too watery. He knew I was unhappy and he was the one that was pushing for this squash risotto, he didnt do anything to make up for the bad dish. At a resto like that I would expect so much more. Overall, theres definitely better. I'm glad I tried it but I would not be returning.We made the reservation two weeks ago. Probably because it's weekday, we are the only customers at 5:00pm.We didn't drink alcohol, only a bottle of water. The water is in glass bottle, taste better than thesame brand in plastic bottle.Tarragon Bison Tongue is the first dish. The tongue is from beef. Mr. Tang said it's good. I prefer the pickle, since I didn't try the tongue.Catch of the day, we picked the smoked eel. It also served with a piece of veal bone, you can eat the marrow(not sure if it's this word...).Fg poutine is great, although foie gras is too greasy for me.The duck in a can is great too. The duck is juicy and fresh, also with blood. The veggie taste a bit sour, really savory.The one missing star is for the dessert. Both icecream and pecan pie are too sweet for me to enjoy.After much hype, I made it here with a few colleagues on a Wednesday evening. The place was absolutely hopping and hard to get into, but we made a reservation a few weeks in advance.Once inside we sat at the bar, which is by far the best seat in the house. It comes with a direct view of the kitchen and all the goodness the chefs are whipping up. We started out with the ham special for appetizer, which was delicious. It came with a baguette and butter which made it perfect. We then had some poutine, which was also quite good. It was definitely better quality than most poutine dishes. For the main course, I went aggressive and got a mixed bowl consisting of blood sausage, pork sausage, mushrooms and onions sitting on top of mashed potatoes. The dish was very good, but not the amazing experience I was hoping for. Spices could have been a little better, but make no mistake it was a very good dish.With its popular reputation, upbeat atmosphere and good food, this is definitely a place worth visiting when in town. They also have a really good bar with interesting drinks. Great overall experience.Delicious food and a must if you're in Montreal. Come in hungry bc you'll get a rich and hearty meal. We ordered the infamous duck in a can, mushroom tortellini (tonites special), the steamed dumplings & plogue a Champlain "foie gras breakfast" - which was the highlight of the night. buckwheat pancake,  thick Canadian bacon, potatoes and cheese topped with foie gras. I wish it was one of the earlier items delivered I would have enjoyed a few more bites. Would def come here with a group to be able to taste more items on the menu. It's a busy restaurant so do make reservations. We scored 9:30 pm reservations on a Sunday night and place was packed with ppl still coming in with reservations after us. Service was slow and we had a really long wait b/t entrees coming out. We didn't leave until after 11:30. Luckily for us, our toddler was still on California time and was cooperative.Visit Montreal for a weekend and made a reservation two weeks in advance. Not too hard: I left a voicemail and someone called me back the next day. Between my friend and I, we ordered:- cromesquis de foie gras, basically deep fried fg. For $4, it was worth it. - temaki tartare, tartare Japanese hand roll. They didn't have bison available and we were offered veal. I quite enjoyed the layers of flavour and texture. - carpaccio de canard, duck carpaccio. My second favorite of the night. - and finally, poutine au foie gras. I hate to say it but this was a bit of a disappointment. I'm a fan of fg but this didn't have the ah-ha for me. We went later in the evening and 2 of the 3 cocktails were already sold out. My reco would be to go early. We also had a lot of trouble finding this place late at night. You really have to know what the front looks like!If you love pork and foie gras, this place is heaven. Recommend getting the foie gras poutine and the duck in a can. We also ordered the onion soup, duck carpaccio and the dumplings.Onion soup - your standard cheesy onion soup done right. Super tasty. Foie gras Poutine - must get!! Abundance of extra buttery and fatty foie gras with fries and gravy. This is a heavy dish so great for sharing and having a cold beer. Duck carpaccio - the presentation of the dish was beautiful. Thinly slice duck with chives, raw mushrooms and a yolk. Duck in a can - must get as well! The waiter brings over the can and opens it in front of the table. The content of the can contains the small duck, foie gras, cabbage which is all poured over the bread with carrot purée. The meat was tender and succulent.The service was very good - our waiter was extremely nice and helpful in making suggestions. There are so many options to choose from so it's great if you come with a big group and share everything!This place is insanely delicious.  The restaurant is a bit tight on space but the kitchen is opened. You can actually hear the staff call out orders.  There are so many options that we probably over ordered for two people!! For starters, we had poutine with foie gras, duck carpaccio and beef tongue.  For entrees we had the duck in a can and the blood sausage tart.  The duck in the can was amazing! We totally over did it on the foie gras but you only live once! We had so much foodWe had to call ahead so the restaurant could accommodate our baby.I went with a southern French person to this restaurant but he did not completely agree with my assessment. Just a caveat. :-)We really wanted to try a Montreal special, as this place is very well known. This place has the famous foie gras poutine and Duck in a Can. We decided to all share to try a few more dishes. The baguette is good!The ambience is nice. We went right when it opened and there was a small line waiting. You cannot get seated if you have not made a reservation. Plan ahead. 1. Garden salad: not on the menu, but we figured we were having so many animal parts this was probably a good idea. $15 for generic salad. The salad was fresh but basic. 2. Mushroom risotto: this dish is very expensive for what it is, but you get a show. They come to your table with a large cheese bowl and add the risotto, mushroom, and even Canadian bacon. This dish had potential but was much too salty. It was hard to finish. 3. Terragon Bison tongue: this is tongue well done. The texture is very soft, which is impressive given the quality of most tongues. The sauces and everything just work well together. However, it's game-y so just be warned. 4. Foie gras poutine: loved it. The fries were good. The gravy was also good. The foie gras was in large blocks and was nice and fatty. I think if you come here, you should get this dish! 5. Duck in a Can: I loved watching them pour half a duck out of a can. Life experience. It even looked nice coming out. The duck came out as a thick filet attached to a flap of lard and also fatty liver (foie gras). I enjoyed this dish very much. It was over puréed cauliflower. The issue I had was that the duck meat was very thick. I had to eat it with slices of the lard to complement the taste. Overall a good dish. 6. Dessert: we got the maple cake and the lemon pie. Both were pretty good. Get the maple cake for novelty sake! Very sweet but good flavors. It was a pricy meal, but for a specialty restaurant it made sense.When my friend and I were certain we wanted to try Au Pied de Cochon, I tried to make reservation (1 week in advance) but their voicemail box was full... I didn't know what to do except, trying to call in the following days... And finally, 2 days before the date we wanted to go, I was finally able to make a reservation (but there weren't any tables left, and the lady asked me if it was okay to be seated at the counter/bar, which I was fine with).Being seated at the counter/bar was actually one exciting experience since we were able to watch the chefs cook and take a glance at all the dishes other customers ordered! It was really mind-blowing watching them cook in a fast-moving environment! I really liked their open-kitchen. It was also fun to guess whether the dish was ours or not too (it was our first time at Au Pied de Cochon, so we didn't know what to expect!)Before coming to Au Pied de Cochon, I searched other people's reviews and made my mind that I wanted to try their Duck in a Can! And this was one of the two dishes we ordered. We didn't know what to order next and my friend thought the The PDC Melting Pot has an interesting name, so we ordered that! Our waiter served us bread and butter (we didn't eat a lot since we wanted to save the tummy for our main courses, but the bread was not too hard, it was perfect!)Duck in a Can: Ordered it like I said because a lot of reviews said it is a must there! It is without doubt an interesting and fun dish. It came in a heated can (like how the name of the dish suggested). So, the waiter brought it over and opened it in front of you, poured the content out of the can (which contains the duck breast, 100g of foie gras, cabbages, the sauce) over the bread with carrot and cauliflower purée. The meat was really tender and it went very well with the cabbage, especially when you eat it with a small piece of duck meat. I actually really like the cabbage! It balanced the richness of the duck meat and foie gras very well. The fat under the duck meat was so chewy (I like chewy stuff) but the other fat part was.... I didn't like it since it was too greasy but some people like the feeling of fat melting in the mouth. We finished the dish (expect for the fat part) since it was too much for us.Duck in a can was quite an experience to be honest, it might not be my favorite dish due to its richness and especially oiliness but it was definitely an unique and interesting experience due to the presentation of the dish in a can!PDC Melting Pot:We actually preferred the melting pot because the taste wasn't as heavy as Duck in a Can and the pot was full of surprises, which made it more interesting. This dish came in a pot which was already hinted with its name! There was pork sausages, shiitake mushrooms, buttery potato cheese which was like mashed potatoes with cheese at the bottom, blood sausage -boudin but it is not like the Asian style one-, pork belly (so yummy!), pork loin and onions. There were a lot of things inside the pot; a lots of surprises! I absolutely loved the "buttery potato cheese", it was so delicious and well-made! The pork was tender and everything in this pot went extremely well with the mashed potatoes! The onion sauce was perfect too! It was a rich dish but not overwhelming like Duck in a Can.We also ordered their Milkshake XXX. My thought of my first sip: this is quite sweet... But afterwards, it got better! I don't know what was inside this milkshake... It tasted like rum (I'm not sure if it contained alcohol though). This was one rich milkshake I would say!We were basically in a food coma after this! I would definitely like to come back again and try their bison tongue (saw good reviews about it!)P.S: Make sure to make a reservation!!! Keep on trying even when their voicemail box is full!Service is outstanding. The employees are so attentive and seem to really love their jobs. Food it also outstanding and some of the best I have had in Montreal. I will say the food is really heavy and I don't want to think about the fat and calories.

It was so tender and flavoured!! And the pasta which was prepared table side was so good! Perfect al dente and with BACON... Drip Drip DripI would have up my star to a 4 because the food was just amazing and the service was excellent. But the management really need to do something about their cooling system. I definitely would be back! PS The reservation system just got so much better as my reservation was confirmed by email and no need to play phone tag again!We had the foie gras poutine, stuffed pied de cochon with foie gras and a tuna dish. All were very rich in flavor and will lead to a heart attack BUT worth every bite. Poutine- get it! after all it is a Canadian dishStuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras- this is large enough for 3-4 people to share, the best part about this dish was the MASHED POTATO, it is sooooooooo good! it has a different texture from the typical mushy mashed potato. Tuna dish- our waiter picked this for us so I don't know what it's called but it's a pretty good dish with gravy and mashed potato on the bottom but it was a little salty though. Overall, amazing FATTY French Canadian food.Very rich food. If you like your food too creamy or too buttery, then this is your type of food. Everything was just very heavy and I couldn't seem to finish the dish. The FG is actually not bad as this was my first time tasting it. Definitely not something I would typically eat but at least I tried it! Plogue Champlain $29Pork filet $30Fg hamburger $39Squash risotto $24Fg poutine $24Eel tart $14The place was jam packed and there's absolutely no room to move if you're sitting on the outside of the table. Service is slow because of how busy it is. Might take you 10min to get the attention of a waitress and another 10 for the bill. Overall definitely a place to try but not something I would do again as its not really my type of food fare.I am judging overall as a meal and the service. First off, the place doesnt have a banner so it is difficult to spot if you dont know where it is. Foie gras poutine. Very good, the foie gras melted in with the poutine and you were able to taste the foie gras. The texture or the plate was consistant, there was cheesy, crispy and then the foie gras made it very good. you were able to taste that the fries were fried in the duck fat and the gravy was creamy and rich. with that being said, a very good dish but will get heavy and sickening after you eat too much of it.Foie gras a la champlain. foie gras on top of a thick slice of bacon, on a bed of thin crispy potato pancake (like a thin hashbrown), topped with a generous amount of maple syrup sauce. First bite was veryyyyy good!! So cripsy from the potato, the bacon was thick and the foie gras was enhanced in this plate, the maple syrup sauce was a good amount of sweet and salty. But this is definitely not a plate you eat on your own, its best for sharing because after a while the taste and maple syrup is quite overwhelming. table side Squash risotto. risotto was cooked very well but since it was table side she made it in the a large parmesan cheese, mixed it all together. She over poured the chicken broth and the risotto became a soup. The waiter asked how it was and I told him honestly that I did not like it because it was too watery. He left then about 3-4 mins later he asked me "do you want me to take it to the chef to try it", well no obviously not! She should have known when she served it because it was clearly too watery. He knew I was unhappy and he was the one that was pushing for this squash risotto, he didnt do anything to make up for the bad dish. At a resto like that I would expect so much more. Overall, theres definitely better. I'm glad I tried it but I would not be returning.We made the reservation two weeks ago. Probably because it's weekday, we are the only customers at 5:00pm.We didn't drink alcohol, only a bottle of water. The water is in glass bottle, taste better than thesame brand in plastic bottle.Tarragon Bison Tongue is the first dish. The tongue is from beef. Mr. Tang said it's good. I prefer the pickle, since I didn't try the tongue.Catch of the day, we picked the smoked eel. It also served with a piece of veal bone, you can eat the marrow(not sure if it's this word...).Fg poutine is great, although foie gras is too greasy for me.The duck in a can is great too. The duck is juicy and fresh, also with blood. The veggie taste a bit sour, really savory.The one missing star is for the dessert. Both icecream and pecan pie are too sweet for me to enjoy.After much hype, I made it here with a few colleagues on a Wednesday evening. The place was absolutely hopping and hard to get into, but we made a reservation a few weeks in advance.Once inside we sat at the bar, which is by far the best seat in the house. It comes with a direct view of the kitchen and all the goodness the chefs are whipping up. We started out with the ham special for appetizer, which was delicious. It came with a baguette and butter which made it perfect. We then had some poutine, which was also quite good. It was definitely better quality than most poutine dishes. For the main course, I went aggressive and got a mixed bowl consisting of blood sausage, pork sausage, mushrooms and onions sitting on top of mashed potatoes. The dish was very good, but not the amazing experience I was hoping for. Spices could have been a little better, but make no mistake it was a very good dish.With its popular reputation, upbeat atmosphere and good food, this is definitely a place worth visiting when in town. They also have a really good bar with interesting drinks. Great overall experience.Delicious food and a must if you're in Montreal. Come in hungry bc you'll get a rich and hearty meal. We ordered the infamous duck in a can, mushroom tortellini (tonites special), the steamed dumplings & plogue a Champlain "foie gras breakfast" - which was the highlight of the night. buckwheat pancake,  thick Canadian bacon, potatoes and cheese topped with foie gras. I wish it was one of the earlier items delivered I would have enjoyed a few more bites. Would def come here with a group to be able to taste more items on the menu. It's a busy restaurant so do make reservations. We scored 9:30 pm reservations on a Sunday night and place was packed with ppl still coming in with reservations after us. Service was slow and we had a really long wait b/t entrees coming out. We didn't leave until after 11:30. Luckily for us, our toddler was still on California time and was cooperative.Visit Montreal for a weekend and made a reservation two weeks in advance. Not too hard: I left a voicemail and someone called me back the next day. Between my friend and I, we ordered:- cromesquis de foie gras, basically deep fried fg. For $4, it was worth it. - temaki tartare, tartare Japanese hand roll. They didn't have bison available and we were offered veal. I quite enjoyed the layers of flavour and texture. - carpaccio de canard, duck carpaccio. My second favorite of the night. - and finally, poutine au foie gras. I hate to say it but this was a bit of a disappointment. I'm a fan of fg but this didn't have the ah-ha for me. We went later in the evening and 2 of the 3 cocktails were already sold out. My reco would be to go early. We also had a lot of trouble finding this place late at night. You really have to know what the front looks like!If you love pork and foie gras, this place is heaven. Recommend getting the foie gras poutine and the duck in a can. We also ordered the onion soup, duck carpaccio and the dumplings.Onion soup - your standard cheesy onion soup done right. Super tasty. Foie gras Poutine - must get!! Abundance of extra buttery and fatty foie gras with fries and gravy. This is a heavy dish so great for sharing and having a cold beer. Duck carpaccio - the presentation of the dish was beautiful. Thinly slice duck with chives, raw mushrooms and a yolk. Duck in a can - must get as well! The waiter brings over the can and opens it in front of the table. The content of the can contains the small duck, foie gras, cabbage which is all poured over the bread with carrot purée. The meat was tender and succulent.The service was very good - our waiter was extremely nice and helpful in making suggestions. There are so many options to choose from so it's great if you come with a big group and share everything!This place is insanely delicious.  The restaurant is a bit tight on space but the kitchen is opened. You can actually hear the staff call out orders.  There are so many options that we probably over ordered for two people!! For starters, we had poutine with foie gras, duck carpaccio and beef tongue.  For entrees we had the duck in a can and the blood sausage tart.  The duck in the can was amazing! We totally over did it on the foie gras but you only live once! We had so much foodWe had to call ahead so the restaurant could accommodate our baby.I went with a southern French person to this restaurant but he did not completely agree with my assessment. Just a caveat. :-)We really wanted to try a Montreal special, as this place is very well known. This place has the famous foie gras poutine and Duck in a Can. We decided to all share to try a few more dishes. The baguette is good!The ambience is nice. We went right when it opened and there was a small line waiting. You cannot get seated if you have not made a reservation. Plan ahead. 1. Garden salad: not on the menu, but we figured we were having so many animal parts this was probably a good idea. $15 for generic salad. The salad was fresh but basic. 2. Mushroom risotto: this dish is very expensive for what it is, but you get a show. They come to your table with a large cheese bowl and add the risotto, mushroom, and even Canadian bacon. This dish had potential but was much too salty. It was hard to finish. 3. Terragon Bison tongue: this is tongue well done. The texture is very soft, which is impressive given the quality of most tongues. The sauces and everything just work well together. However, it's game-y so just be warned. 4. Foie gras poutine: loved it. The fries were good. The gravy was also good. The foie gras was in large blocks and was nice and fatty. I think if you come here, you should get this dish! 5. Duck in a Can: I loved watching them pour half a duck out of a can. Life experience. It even looked nice coming out. The duck came out as a thick filet attached to a flap of lard and also fatty liver (foie gras). I enjoyed this dish very much. It was over puréed cauliflower. The issue I had was that the duck meat was very thick. I had to eat it with slices of the lard to complement the taste. Overall a good dish. 6. Dessert: we got the maple cake and the lemon pie. Both were pretty good. Get the maple cake for novelty sake! Very sweet but good flavors. It was a pricy meal, but for a specialty restaurant it made sense.When my friend and I were certain we wanted to try Au Pied de Cochon, I tried to make reservation (1 week in advance) but their voicemail box was full... I didn't know what to do except, trying to call in the following days... And finally, 2 days before the date we wanted to go, I was finally able to make a reservation (but there weren't any tables left, and the lady asked me if it was okay to be seated at the counter/bar, which I was fine with).Being seated at the counter/bar was actually one exciting experience since we were able to watch the chefs cook and take a glance at all the dishes other customers ordered! It was really mind-blowing watching them cook in a fast-moving environment! I really liked their open-kitchen. It was also fun to guess whether the dish was ours or not too (it was our first time at Au Pied de Cochon, so we didn't know what to expect!)Before coming to Au Pied de Cochon, I searched other people's reviews and made my mind that I wanted to try their Duck in a Can! And this was one of the two dishes we ordered. We didn't know what to order next and my friend thought the The PDC Melting Pot has an interesting name, so we ordered that! Our waiter served us bread and butter (we didn't eat a lot since we wanted to save the tummy for our main courses, but the bread was not too hard, it was perfect!)Duck in a Can: Ordered it like I said because a lot of reviews said it is a must there! It is without doubt an interesting and fun dish. It came in a heated can (like how the name of the dish suggested). So, the waiter brought it over and opened it in front of you, poured the content out of the can (which contains the duck breast, 100g of foie gras, cabbages, the sauce) over the bread with carrot and cauliflower purée. The meat was really tender and it went very well with the cabbage, especially when you eat it with a small piece of duck meat. I actually really like the cabbage! It balanced the richness of the duck meat and foie gras very well. The fat under the duck meat was so chewy (I like chewy stuff) but the other fat part was.... I didn't like it since it was too greasy but some people like the feeling of fat melting in the mouth. We finished the dish (expect for the fat part) since it was too much for us.Duck in a can was quite an experience to be honest, it might not be my favorite dish due to its richness and especially oiliness but it was definitely an unique and interesting experience due to the presentation of the dish in a can!PDC Melting Pot:We actually preferred the melting pot because the taste wasn't as heavy as Duck in a Can and the pot was full of surprises, which made it more interesting. This dish came in a pot which was already hinted with its name! There was pork sausages, shiitake mushrooms, buttery potato cheese which was like mashed potatoes with cheese at the bottom, blood sausage -boudin but it is not like the Asian style one-, pork belly (so yummy!), pork loin and onions. There were a lot of things inside the pot; a lots of surprises! I absolutely loved the "buttery potato cheese", it was so delicious and well-made! The pork was tender and everything in this pot went extremely well with the mashed potatoes! The onion sauce was perfect too! It was a rich dish but not overwhelming like Duck in a Can.We also ordered their Milkshake XXX. My thought of my first sip: this is quite sweet... But afterwards, it got better! I don't know what was inside this milkshake... It tasted like rum (I'm not sure if it contained alcohol though). This was one rich milkshake I would say!We were basically in a food coma after this! I would definitely like to come back again and try their bison tongue (saw good reviews about it!)P.S: Make sure to make a reservation!!! Keep on trying even when their voicemail box is full!Service is outstanding. The employees are so attentive and seem to really love their jobs. Food it also outstanding and some of the best I have had in Montreal. I will say the food is really heavy and I don't want to think about the fat and calories. You'll probably walk out having eaten 2000 calories and well over 50 grams of fat, per person. Then again, if you really care about that stuff, subways right around the corner. Treat yourself, check it out. You will not be disappointed.We came to celebrate my husband's birthday. We reserved via email. It's the easiest way. I highly recommend reserving this way. I do not recommend going on Sunday's. They're out of everything. They were out of a few items. I didn't care for some, but being out of Ribs, Sweetbread, and BEER?! That was very disappointing. I ended up getting the famous Duck in a Can. Great flavour. Very delicious. Duck cooked to perfection. Then the Ragout. I liked the texture and how all the ingredients complimented each other, but it was wayyy too salty. I loved how it was prepared in a cheese block in front of us. Our waitress was rude and short with everything. Uninformative. We felt very rushed by her. Pretty much everything sucked but the Duck in a Can. I will come back and perhaps the experience will be better to tie with the good food.One of the best restaurants I have ever been to (if not the best).I had the duck in a can and my friend the risotto.The risotto is mixed in inside a large parmeggiano cheesw block and the duck is cooked inside the can for 27 minutes to a perfect taste.What an experienceService was great too!!Ouff getting a reservation at au PdeC was not an easy task ... who still operates over voicemail? Especially over a voicemail box that is always full?!But au PdeC still seems to get away with it thanks to all the hype Anthony Bourdain created during his 24 hour Montreal layover (if you've never watched it: dailymotion.com/.../xo2k…...).Needless to say, we had to try it out ourselves or we couldn't be called true Montrealers. But the overwhelming foie gras stuffed courses were too much for two people to handle, so we brought 2 friends for back up! All in all, if you come knowing that this will not be a fine dining experience and that you WILL be overindulging in rich and heavy courses, then your experience will be a satisfying one. And let's be honest, everything just tastes better with fat!From the foie gras stuffed croquettes that just ooze in your mouth as you bite into them, to the decadent poutine topped with foie gras gravy and a whole piece of foie gras and then the squash risotto cooked in a whole wheel of parmesan...! Your reward center will be firing away happy signals for hours to come smile emoticonAll this goodness, paired with a nice bottle of french wine (they have an extensive french heavy wine list and some good beer on tap) made this a highly enjoyable 'tourist in your own city experience'. Good food, good wine and great company along with a surprisingly affordable tab... what's not to like?Heard lots of great reviews for Au Pied de Cochon. This restaurant was featured on one of the shows by Anthony Bourdain! Service was excellent.DRINKS:Pied de Cochon beer x 2TERRAINE OF FOIE GRAS (4/5)Came with jam and bread. So delicious - it's pure foie gras. The taste is very strong and flavourful. A must for foie gras lovers :) I actually enjoyed this dish better without adding the jam on my slice of bread.FOIE GRAS POUTINE (5/5)A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! The closer you are to Montreal, the better the poutine gets and this one is a 5-star poutine for sure! Large slices of foie gras and big chunks of cheese.. mm fatty good!DUCK IN A CAN (5/5)So creative! It's a mini show when the waiter comes over and open the can in front of us (I recorded it all haha). The duck meat was tender and juicy - delicious. I would order this again the next time I visit Au Pied de Cochon.This place is the epitome of French Canadian cuisine. If you want an authentic Canadian culinary experience then this is not to be missed. The food is not for the faint of hearts and definitely leave your vegetarian friends at home. I wouldn't say this is a good everyday-go-to kinda restaurant so come here when you have visitors from out of town or for a special occasion. On to our meal. After cleansing our palettes with foie gras croquettes, we were ready for our main event. We bravely ordered the whole pig's head for two and I can say that it has been one of my most memorable meals. The head of pig was roasted to glistening perfection. Paired with apple and root veggies, the whole plate was full of flavour and tender juicy porky deliciousness. Since they have an open kitchen, people took pictures of our food as it made its way towards our table. It was quite the show! Have to admit I couldn't eat pork for a couple of weeks after but it was definitely worth every bite. Eating at Au Pied is a special event you don't want to miss.Do you love ducks? Or better yet, do you hate ducks? To the point where you'll eat ducks in every form for 3 different dishes? If so, Au Pied de Cochon is just what the doctor ordered.Sure, the name translates to the pig's feet, but the duck is where it's at.Foie gras poutine is about as rich and delicious as it sounds.The duck in a can (which COMES WITH FOIE GRAS) is also a must. Just watching the waiter take a can opener to it and drop it onto a plate is a thing of beauty. The entire can is boiled and then brought out. All the spices are infused and all the fattiness is preserved without getting boiled off. Super unique. Just don't overdo it. One can is probably enough for 3-4 people unless you REALLY want to feel unhealthy.We also got a side of duck fat fries, because WHY THE HELL NOT?There were 8 of us, so we did a few other entrees as well. One was the PDC's cut, which the waiter told us was a boneless pork chop (there was a bone). It looked dry, but it was actually incredibly moist. It was a gigantic hunk of meat too.We also did one of the specials - the Ahi tuna steak for two. Let me tell you, it was NOT for two. Maybe if you fasted and that was the only thing you ate that day. But it was also good. Perfectly rare, with a ton of veggies and cheese on the side. It was probably our least favorite of the dishes, but even still, it was very well done.We were seated all the way in the back by the wine cellar, so it was a bit of a tight squeeze (especially with another large group next to us), but there wasn't much else to complain about. They also have one hell of a wine list.Our waiter was super cool and gave us shots to round out the night.Probably one of the best meals I've ever had. Also, why I came back to the States with none of pants fitting anymore.Make reservations! Either call/email or reserve online. It's a must. Also come hungry, because, they serve a lot of food.This place gets super packed during the dinner rush. Even dining at the counter gets full.I'd recommend the foie gras duo to get the best out of APC. If you're dining with friends, then I'm sure you can taste each other's food. But for a single diner like myself, the foie gras duo comes with Foie Gras burger and foie gras poutine fries. Huge portions for about $50. Very fatty, very rich, and very good.I started off with the tuna tartare as an appetizer, but even though it is a small portion, I couldn't get through my foie gras duo because of the enormity of the portions. The tuna tartare was tarty and fresh.And I still wanted dessert after and I chose the toffee maple milk shake. They made it right in front me...I guess because I was in the counter, but you can see all the fatty goodness when they make this. Not to sweet, but I had enough room to finish it. I would order this again.Trying to find street parking might be hard for you during dinner time. And the metro station is several blocks away. You can probably try the bixi bikes if you have time to roam around this part of the Montreal neighborhood.Drip Drip Drip4 star for food and service but -0.5 star for all the water dripping from the vent on top of my head all through my dinner.Drip Drip Dip I know it was one of the hottest weekend in Montreal. It was end of July after all and I should be thankful for the nice cool interior of the restaurant with their AC on full blast. But with the water dripping on me the whole time (2 hour) while I was enjoying my dinner was not cool. The staff was all trying their best to stop the dripping from top of the AC vent which ran across the full depth of the restaurant by a squeegee sponge but it was not working....Drip Drip DripDinner was really good!! Excellent!We shared Tarragon Bison Tongue ($8.50) - I just love the Cornichon in that! And now I have a bottle in my fridge at home!Pâté de Campagne ($9) - So smooth and rich!Duck Carpaccio ($14) - Well seasoned, my first time having duck carpaccioDuck in a Can ($44) - So overhyped! The duck was dry and just not good! Foie Gras was so so. I don't believe I said that but I preferred mine seared...Braised Pig Feet with Side Pasta ($50) Seasonal - Must Order!! It was so tender and flavoured!! And the pasta which was prepared table side was so good! Perfect al dente and with BACON... Drip Drip DripI would have up my star to a 4 because the food was just amazing and the service was excellent. But the management really need to do something about their cooling system. I definitely would be back! PS The reservation system just got so much better as my reservation was confirmed by email and no need to play phone tag again!We had the foie gras poutine, stuffed pied de cochon with foie gras and a tuna dish.

Garden salad: not on the menu, but we figured we were having so many animal parts this was probably a good idea. $15 for generic salad. The salad was fresh but basic. 2. Mushroom risotto: this dish is very expensive for what it is, but you get a show. They come to your table with a large cheese bowl and add the risotto, mushroom, and even Canadian bacon. This dish had potential but was much too salty. It was hard to finish. 3. Terragon Bison tongue: this is tongue well done. The texture is very soft, which is impressive given the quality of most tongues. The sauces and everything just work well together. However, it's game-y so just be warned. 4. Foie gras poutine: loved it. The fries were good. The gravy was also good. The foie gras was in large blocks and was nice and fatty. I think if you come here, you should get this dish! 5. Duck in a Can: I loved watching them pour half a duck out of a can. Life experience. It even looked nice coming out. The duck came out as a thick filet attached to a flap of lard and also fatty liver (foie gras). I enjoyed this dish very much. It was over puréed cauliflower. The issue I had was that the duck meat was very thick. I had to eat it with slices of the lard to complement the taste. Overall a good dish. 6. Dessert: we got the maple cake and the lemon pie. Both were pretty good. Get the maple cake for novelty sake! Very sweet but good flavors. It was a pricy meal, but for a specialty restaurant it made sense.When my friend and I were certain we wanted to try Au Pied de Cochon, I tried to make reservation (1 week in advance) but their voicemail box was full... I didn't know what to do except, trying to call in the following days... And finally, 2 days before the date we wanted to go, I was finally able to make a reservation (but there weren't any tables left, and the lady asked me if it was okay to be seated at the counter/bar, which I was fine with).Being seated at the counter/bar was actually one exciting experience since we were able to watch the chefs cook and take a glance at all the dishes other customers ordered! It was really mind-blowing watching them cook in a fast-moving environment! I really liked their open-kitchen. It was also fun to guess whether the dish was ours or not too (it was our first time at Au Pied de Cochon, so we didn't know what to expect!)Before coming to Au Pied de Cochon, I searched other people's reviews and made my mind that I wanted to try their Duck in a Can! And this was one of the two dishes we ordered. We didn't know what to order next and my friend thought the The PDC Melting Pot has an interesting name, so we ordered that! Our waiter served us bread and butter (we didn't eat a lot since we wanted to save the tummy for our main courses, but the bread was not too hard, it was perfect!)Duck in a Can: Ordered it like I said because a lot of reviews said it is a must there! It is without doubt an interesting and fun dish. It came in a heated can (like how the name of the dish suggested). So, the waiter brought it over and opened it in front of you, poured the content out of the can (which contains the duck breast, 100g of foie gras, cabbages, the sauce) over the bread with carrot and cauliflower purée. The meat was really tender and it went very well with the cabbage, especially when you eat it with a small piece of duck meat. I actually really like the cabbage! It balanced the richness of the duck meat and foie gras very well. The fat under the duck meat was so chewy (I like chewy stuff) but the other fat part was.... I didn't like it since it was too greasy but some people like the feeling of fat melting in the mouth. We finished the dish (expect for the fat part) since it was too much for us.Duck in a can was quite an experience to be honest, it might not be my favorite dish due to its richness and especially oiliness but it was definitely an unique and interesting experience due to the presentation of the dish in a can!PDC Melting Pot:We actually preferred the melting pot because the taste wasn't as heavy as Duck in a Can and the pot was full of surprises, which made it more interesting. This dish came in a pot which was already hinted with its name! There was pork sausages, shiitake mushrooms, buttery potato cheese which was like mashed potatoes with cheese at the bottom, blood sausage -boudin but it is not like the Asian style one-, pork belly (so yummy!), pork loin and onions. There were a lot of things inside the pot; a lots of surprises! I absolutely loved the "buttery potato cheese", it was so delicious and well-made! The pork was tender and everything in this pot went extremely well with the mashed potatoes! The onion sauce was perfect too! It was a rich dish but not overwhelming like Duck in a Can.We also ordered their Milkshake XXX. My thought of my first sip: this is quite sweet... But afterwards, it got better! I don't know what was inside this milkshake... It tasted like rum (I'm not sure if it contained alcohol though). This was one rich milkshake I would say!We were basically in a food coma after this! I would definitely like to come back again and try their bison tongue (saw good reviews about it!)P.S: Make sure to make a reservation!!! Keep on trying even when their voicemail box is full!Service is outstanding. The employees are so attentive and seem to really love their jobs. Food it also outstanding and some of the best I have had in Montreal. I will say the food is really heavy and I don't want to think about the fat and calories. You'll probably walk out having eaten 2000 calories and well over 50 grams of fat, per person. Then again, if you really care about that stuff, subways right around the corner. Treat yourself, check it out. You will not be disappointed.We came to celebrate my husband's birthday. We reserved via email. It's the easiest way. I highly recommend reserving this way. I do not recommend going on Sunday's. They're out of everything. They were out of a few items. I didn't care for some, but being out of Ribs, Sweetbread, and BEER?! That was very disappointing. I ended up getting the famous Duck in a Can. Great flavour. Very delicious. Duck cooked to perfection. Then the Ragout. I liked the texture and how all the ingredients complimented each other, but it was wayyy too salty. I loved how it was prepared in a cheese block in front of us. Our waitress was rude and short with everything. Uninformative. We felt very rushed by her. Pretty much everything sucked but the Duck in a Can. I will come back and perhaps the experience will be better to tie with the good food.One of the best restaurants I have ever been to (if not the best).I had the duck in a can and my friend the risotto.The risotto is mixed in inside a large parmeggiano cheesw block and the duck is cooked inside the can for 27 minutes to a perfect taste.What an experienceService was great too!!Ouff getting a reservation at au PdeC was not an easy task ... who still operates over voicemail? Especially over a voicemail box that is always full?!But au PdeC still seems to get away with it thanks to all the hype Anthony Bourdain created during his 24 hour Montreal layover (if you've never watched it: dailymotion.com/.../xo2k…...).Needless to say, we had to try it out ourselves or we couldn't be called true Montrealers. But the overwhelming foie gras stuffed courses were too much for two people to handle, so we brought 2 friends for back up! All in all, if you come knowing that this will not be a fine dining experience and that you WILL be overindulging in rich and heavy courses, then your experience will be a satisfying one. And let's be honest, everything just tastes better with fat!From the foie gras stuffed croquettes that just ooze in your mouth as you bite into them, to the decadent poutine topped with foie gras gravy and a whole piece of foie gras and then the squash risotto cooked in a whole wheel of parmesan...! Your reward center will be firing away happy signals for hours to come smile emoticonAll this goodness, paired with a nice bottle of french wine (they have an extensive french heavy wine list and some good beer on tap) made this a highly enjoyable 'tourist in your own city experience'. Good food, good wine and great company along with a surprisingly affordable tab... what's not to like?Heard lots of great reviews for Au Pied de Cochon. This restaurant was featured on one of the shows by Anthony Bourdain! Service was excellent.DRINKS:Pied de Cochon beer x 2TERRAINE OF FOIE GRAS (4/5)Came with jam and bread. So delicious - it's pure foie gras. The taste is very strong and flavourful. A must for foie gras lovers :) I actually enjoyed this dish better without adding the jam on my slice of bread.FOIE GRAS POUTINE (5/5)A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! The closer you are to Montreal, the better the poutine gets and this one is a 5-star poutine for sure! Large slices of foie gras and big chunks of cheese.. mm fatty good!DUCK IN A CAN (5/5)So creative! It's a mini show when the waiter comes over and open the can in front of us (I recorded it all haha). The duck meat was tender and juicy - delicious. I would order this again the next time I visit Au Pied de Cochon.This place is the epitome of French Canadian cuisine. If you want an authentic Canadian culinary experience then this is not to be missed. The food is not for the faint of hearts and definitely leave your vegetarian friends at home. I wouldn't say this is a good everyday-go-to kinda restaurant so come here when you have visitors from out of town or for a special occasion. On to our meal. After cleansing our palettes with foie gras croquettes, we were ready for our main event. We bravely ordered the whole pig's head for two and I can say that it has been one of my most memorable meals. The head of pig was roasted to glistening perfection. Paired with apple and root veggies, the whole plate was full of flavour and tender juicy porky deliciousness. Since they have an open kitchen, people took pictures of our food as it made its way towards our table. It was quite the show! Have to admit I couldn't eat pork for a couple of weeks after but it was definitely worth every bite. Eating at Au Pied is a special event you don't want to miss.Do you love ducks? Or better yet, do you hate ducks? To the point where you'll eat ducks in every form for 3 different dishes? If so, Au Pied de Cochon is just what the doctor ordered.Sure, the name translates to the pig's feet, but the duck is where it's at.Foie gras poutine is about as rich and delicious as it sounds.The duck in a can (which COMES WITH FOIE GRAS) is also a must. Just watching the waiter take a can opener to it and drop it onto a plate is a thing of beauty. The entire can is boiled and then brought out. All the spices are infused and all the fattiness is preserved without getting boiled off. Super unique. Just don't overdo it. One can is probably enough for 3-4 people unless you REALLY want to feel unhealthy.We also got a side of duck fat fries, because WHY THE HELL NOT?There were 8 of us, so we did a few other entrees as well. One was the PDC's cut, which the waiter told us was a boneless pork chop (there was a bone). It looked dry, but it was actually incredibly moist. It was a gigantic hunk of meat too.We also did one of the specials - the Ahi tuna steak for two. Let me tell you, it was NOT for two. Maybe if you fasted and that was the only thing you ate that day. But it was also good. Perfectly rare, with a ton of veggies and cheese on the side. It was probably our least favorite of the dishes, but even still, it was very well done.We were seated all the way in the back by the wine cellar, so it was a bit of a tight squeeze (especially with another large group next to us), but there wasn't much else to complain about. They also have one hell of a wine list.Our waiter was super cool and gave us shots to round out the night.Probably one of the best meals I've ever had. Also, why I came back to the States with none of pants fitting anymore.Make reservations! Either call/email or reserve online. It's a must. Also come hungry, because, they serve a lot of food.This place gets super packed during the dinner rush. Even dining at the counter gets full.I'd recommend the foie gras duo to get the best out of APC. If you're dining with friends, then I'm sure you can taste each other's food. But for a single diner like myself, the foie gras duo comes with Foie Gras burger and foie gras poutine fries. Huge portions for about $50. Very fatty, very rich, and very good.I started off with the tuna tartare as an appetizer, but even though it is a small portion, I couldn't get through my foie gras duo because of the enormity of the portions. The tuna tartare was tarty and fresh.And I still wanted dessert after and I chose the toffee maple milk shake. They made it right in front me...I guess because I was in the counter, but you can see all the fatty goodness when they make this. Not to sweet, but I had enough room to finish it. I would order this again.Trying to find street parking might be hard for you during dinner time. And the metro station is several blocks away. You can probably try the bixi bikes if you have time to roam around this part of the Montreal neighborhood.Drip Drip Drip4 star for food and service but -0.5 star for all the water dripping from the vent on top of my head all through my dinner.Drip Drip Dip I know it was one of the hottest weekend in Montreal. It was end of July after all and I should be thankful for the nice cool interior of the restaurant with their AC on full blast. But with the water dripping on me the whole time (2 hour) while I was enjoying my dinner was not cool. The staff was all trying their best to stop the dripping from top of the AC vent which ran across the full depth of the restaurant by a squeegee sponge but it was not working....Drip Drip DripDinner was really good!! Excellent!We shared Tarragon Bison Tongue ($8.50) - I just love the Cornichon in that! And now I have a bottle in my fridge at home!Pâté de Campagne ($9) - So smooth and rich!Duck Carpaccio ($14) - Well seasoned, my first time having duck carpaccioDuck in a Can ($44) - So overhyped! The duck was dry and just not good! Foie Gras was so so. I don't believe I said that but I preferred mine seared...Braised Pig Feet with Side Pasta ($50) Seasonal - Must Order!! It was so tender and flavoured!! And the pasta which was prepared table side was so good! Perfect al dente and with BACON... Drip Drip DripI would have up my star to a 4 because the food was just amazing and the service was excellent. But the management really need to do something about their cooling system. I definitely would be back! PS The reservation system just got so much better as my reservation was confirmed by email and no need to play phone tag again!We had the foie gras poutine, stuffed pied de cochon with foie gras and a tuna dish. All were very rich in flavor and will lead to a heart attack BUT worth every bite. Poutine- get it! after all it is a Canadian dishStuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras- this is large enough for 3-4 people to share, the best part about this dish was the MASHED POTATO, it is sooooooooo good! it has a different texture from the typical mushy mashed potato. Tuna dish- our waiter picked this for us so I don't know what it's called but it's a pretty good dish with gravy and mashed potato on the bottom but it was a little salty though. Overall, amazing FATTY French Canadian food.Very rich food. If you like your food too creamy or too buttery, then this is your type of food. Everything was just very heavy and I couldn't seem to finish the dish. The FG is actually not bad as this was my first time tasting it. Definitely not something I would typically eat but at least I tried it! Plogue Champlain $29Pork filet $30Fg hamburger $39Squash risotto $24Fg poutine $24Eel tart $14The place was jam packed and there's absolutely no room to move if you're sitting on the outside of the table. Service is slow because of how busy it is. Might take you 10min to get the attention of a waitress and another 10 for the bill. Overall definitely a place to try but not something I would do again as its not really my type of food fare.I am judging overall as a meal and the service. First off, the place doesnt have a banner so it is difficult to spot if you dont know where it is. Foie gras poutine. Very good, the foie gras melted in with the poutine and you were able to taste the foie gras. The texture or the plate was consistant, there was cheesy, crispy and then the foie gras made it very good. you were able to taste that the fries were fried in the duck fat and the gravy was creamy and rich. with that being said, a very good dish but will get heavy and sickening after you eat too much of it.Foie gras a la champlain. foie gras on top of a thick slice of bacon, on a bed of thin crispy potato pancake (like a thin hashbrown), topped with a generous amount of maple syrup sauce. First bite was veryyyyy good!! So cripsy from the potato, the bacon was thick and the foie gras was enhanced in this plate, the maple syrup sauce was a good amount of sweet and salty. But this is definitely not a plate you eat on your own, its best for sharing because after a while the taste and maple syrup is quite overwhelming. table side Squash risotto. risotto was cooked very well but since it was table side she made it in the a large parmesan cheese, mixed it all together. She over poured the chicken broth and the risotto became a soup. The waiter asked how it was and I told him honestly that I did not like it because it was too watery. He left then about 3-4 mins later he asked me "do you want me to take it to the chef to try it", well no obviously not! She should have known when she served it because it was clearly too watery. He knew I was unhappy and he was the one that was pushing for this squash risotto, he didnt do anything to make up for the bad dish. At a resto like that I would expect so much more. Overall, theres definitely better. I'm glad I tried it but I would not be returning.We made the reservation two weeks ago. Probably because it's weekday, we are the only customers at 5:00pm.We didn't drink alcohol, only a bottle of water. The water is in glass bottle, taste better than thesame brand in plastic bottle.Tarragon Bison Tongue is the first dish. The tongue is from beef. Mr. Tang said it's good. I prefer the pickle, since I didn't try the tongue.Catch of the day, we picked the smoked eel. It also served with a piece of veal bone, you can eat the marrow(not sure if it's this word...).Fg poutine is great, although foie gras is too greasy for me.The duck in a can is great too. The duck is juicy and fresh, also with blood. The veggie taste a bit sour, really savory.The one missing star is for the dessert. Both icecream and pecan pie are too sweet for me to enjoy.After much hype, I made it here with a few colleagues on a Wednesday evening. The place was absolutely hopping and hard to get into, but we made a reservation a few weeks in advance.Once inside we sat at the bar, which is by far the best seat in the house. It comes with a direct view of the kitchen and all the goodness the chefs are whipping up. We started out with the ham special for appetizer, which was delicious. It came with a baguette and butter which made it perfect. We then had some poutine, which was also quite good. It was definitely better quality than most poutine dishes. For the main course, I went aggressive and got a mixed bowl consisting of blood sausage, pork sausage, mushrooms and onions sitting on top of mashed potatoes. The dish was very good, but not the amazing experience I was hoping for. Spices could have been a little better, but make no mistake it was a very good dish.With its popular reputation, upbeat atmosphere and good food, this is definitely a place worth visiting when in town. They also have a really good bar with interesting drinks. Great overall experience.Delicious food and a must if you're in Montreal. Come in hungry bc you'll get a rich and hearty meal. We ordered the infamous duck in a can, mushroom tortellini (tonites special), the steamed dumplings & plogue a Champlain "foie gras breakfast" - which was the highlight of the night. buckwheat pancake,  thick Canadian bacon, potatoes and cheese topped with foie gras. I wish it was one of the earlier items delivered I would have enjoyed a few more bites. Would def come here with a group to be able to taste more items on the menu. It's a busy restaurant so do make reservations. We scored 9:30 pm reservations on a Sunday night and place was packed with ppl still coming in with reservations after us. Service was slow and we had a really long wait b/t entrees coming out. We didn't leave until after 11:30. Luckily for us, our toddler was still on California time and was cooperative.Visit Montreal for a weekend and made a reservation two weeks in advance. Not too hard: I left a voicemail and someone called me back the next day. Between my friend and I, we ordered:- cromesquis de foie gras, basically deep fried fg. For $4, it was worth it. - temaki tartare, tartare Japanese hand roll. They didn't have bison available and we were offered veal. I quite enjoyed the layers of flavour and texture. - carpaccio de canard, duck carpaccio. My second favorite of the night. - and finally, poutine au foie gras. I hate to say it but this was a bit of a disappointment. I'm a fan of fg but this didn't have the ah-ha for me. We went later in the evening and 2 of the 3 cocktails were already sold out. My reco would be to go early. We also had a lot of trouble finding this place late at night. You really have to know what the front looks like!If you love pork and foie gras, this place is heaven. Recommend getting the foie gras poutine and the duck in a can. We also ordered the onion soup, duck carpaccio and the dumplings.Onion soup - your standard cheesy onion soup done right. Super tasty. Foie gras Poutine - must get!! Abundance of extra buttery and fatty foie gras with fries and gravy. This is a heavy dish so great for sharing and having a cold beer. Duck carpaccio - the presentation of the dish was beautiful. Thinly slice duck with chives, raw mushrooms and a yolk. Duck in a can - must get as well! The waiter brings over the can and opens it in front of the table. The content of the can contains the small duck, foie gras, cabbage which is all poured over the bread with carrot purée. The meat was tender and succulent.The service was very good - our waiter was extremely nice and helpful in making suggestions. There are so many options to choose from so it's great if you come with a big group and share everything!This place is insanely delicious.  The restaurant is a bit tight on space but the kitchen is opened. You can actually hear the staff call out orders.  There are so many options that we probably over ordered for two people!! For starters, we had poutine with foie gras, duck carpaccio and beef tongue.  For entrees we had the duck in a can and the blood sausage tart.  The duck in the can was amazing! We totally over did it on the foie gras but you only live once! We had so much foodWe had to call ahead so the restaurant could accommodate our baby.I went with a southern French person to this restaurant but he did not completely agree with my assessment. Just a caveat. :-)We really wanted to try a Montreal special, as this place is very well known. This place has the famous foie gras poutine and Duck in a Can. We decided to all share to try a few more dishes. The baguette is good!The ambience is nice. We went right when it opened and there was a small line waiting. You cannot get seated if you have not made a reservation. Plan ahead. 1.

Duck in a Can: I loved watching them pour half a duck out of a can. Life experience. It even looked nice coming out. The duck came out as a thick filet attached to a flap of lard and also fatty liver (foie gras). I enjoyed this dish very much. It was over puréed cauliflower. The issue I had was that the duck meat was very thick. I had to eat it with slices of the lard to complement the taste. Overall a good dish. 6. Dessert: we got the maple cake and the lemon pie.

After cleansing our palettes with foie gras croquettes, we were ready for our main event. We bravely ordered the whole pig's head for two and I can say that it has been one of my most memorable meals. The head of pig was roasted to glistening perfection. Paired with apple and root veggies, the whole plate was full of flavour and tender juicy porky deliciousness. Since they have an open kitchen, people took pictures of our food as it made its way towards our table. It was quite the show! Have to admit I couldn't eat pork for a couple of weeks after but it was definitely worth every bite. Eating at Au Pied is a special event you don't want to miss.Do you love ducks? Or better yet, do you hate ducks? To the point where you'll eat ducks in every form for 3 different dishes? If so, Au Pied de Cochon is just what the doctor ordered.Sure, the name translates to the pig's feet, but the duck is where it's at.Foie gras poutine is about as rich and delicious as it sounds.The duck in a can (which COMES WITH FOIE GRAS) is also a must. Just watching the waiter take a can opener to it and drop it onto a plate is a thing of beauty. The entire can is boiled and then brought out. All the spices are infused and all the fattiness is preserved without getting boiled off. Super unique. Just don't overdo it. One can is probably enough for 3-4 people unless you REALLY want to feel unhealthy.We also got a side of duck fat fries, because WHY THE HELL NOT?There were 8 of us, so we did a few other entrees as well. One was the PDC's cut, which the waiter told us was a boneless pork chop (there was a bone). It looked dry, but it was actually incredibly moist. It was a gigantic hunk of meat too.We also did one of the specials - the Ahi tuna steak for two. Let me tell you, it was NOT for two. Maybe if you fasted and that was the only thing you ate that day. But it was also good. Perfectly rare, with a ton of veggies and cheese on the side. It was probably our least favorite of the dishes, but even still, it was very well done.We were seated all the way in the back by the wine cellar, so it was a bit of a tight squeeze (especially with another large group next to us), but there wasn't much else to complain about. They also have one hell of a wine list.Our waiter was super cool and gave us shots to round out the night.Probably one of the best meals I've ever had. Also, why I came back to the States with none of pants fitting anymore.Make reservations! Either call/email or reserve online. It's a must. Also come hungry, because, they serve a lot of food.This place gets super packed during the dinner rush. Even dining at the counter gets full.I'd recommend the foie gras duo to get the best out of APC. If you're dining with friends, then I'm sure you can taste each other's food. But for a single diner like myself, the foie gras duo comes with Foie Gras burger and foie gras poutine fries. Huge portions for about $50. Very fatty, very rich, and very good.I started off with the tuna tartare as an appetizer, but even though it is a small portion, I couldn't get through my foie gras duo because of the enormity of the portions. The tuna tartare was tarty and fresh.And I still wanted dessert after and I chose the toffee maple milk shake. They made it right in front me...I guess because I was in the counter, but you can see all the fatty goodness when they make this. Not to sweet, but I had enough room to finish it. I would order this again.Trying to find street parking might be hard for you during dinner time. And the metro station is several blocks away. You can probably try the bixi bikes if you have time to roam around this part of the Montreal neighborhood.Drip Drip Drip4 star for food and service but -0.5 star for all the water dripping from the vent on top of my head all through my dinner.Drip Drip Dip I know it was one of the hottest weekend in Montreal. It was end of July after all and I should be thankful for the nice cool interior of the restaurant with their AC on full blast. But with the water dripping on me the whole time (2 hour) while I was enjoying my dinner was not cool. The staff was all trying their best to stop the dripping from top of the AC vent which ran across the full depth of the restaurant by a squeegee sponge but it was not working....Drip Drip DripDinner was really good!! Excellent!We shared Tarragon Bison Tongue ($8.50) - I just love the Cornichon in that! And now I have a bottle in my fridge at home!Pâté de Campagne ($9) - So smooth and rich!Duck Carpaccio ($14) - Well seasoned, my first time having duck carpaccioDuck in a Can ($44) - So overhyped! The duck was dry and just not good! Foie Gras was so so. I don't believe I said that but I preferred mine seared...Braised Pig Feet with Side Pasta ($50) Seasonal - Must Order!! It was so tender and flavoured!! And the pasta which was prepared table side was so good! Perfect al dente and with BACON... Drip Drip DripI would have up my star to a 4 because the food was just amazing and the service was excellent. But the management really need to do something about their cooling system. I definitely would be back! PS The reservation system just got so much better as my reservation was confirmed by email and no need to play phone tag again!We had the foie gras poutine, stuffed pied de cochon with foie gras and a tuna dish. All were very rich in flavor and will lead to a heart attack BUT worth every bite. Poutine- get it! after all it is a Canadian dishStuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras- this is large enough for 3-4 people to share, the best part about this dish was the MASHED POTATO, it is sooooooooo good! it has a different texture from the typical mushy mashed potato. Tuna dish- our waiter picked this for us so I don't know what it's called but it's a pretty good dish with gravy and mashed potato on the bottom but it was a little salty though. Overall, amazing FATTY French Canadian food.Very rich food. If you like your food too creamy or too buttery, then this is your type of food. Everything was just very heavy and I couldn't seem to finish the dish. The FG is actually not bad as this was my first time tasting it. Definitely not something I would typically eat but at least I tried it! Plogue Champlain $29Pork filet $30Fg hamburger $39Squash risotto $24Fg poutine $24Eel tart $14The place was jam packed and there's absolutely no room to move if you're sitting on the outside of the table. Service is slow because of how busy it is. Might take you 10min to get the attention of a waitress and another 10 for the bill. Overall definitely a place to try but not something I would do again as its not really my type of food fare.I am judging overall as a meal and the service. First off, the place doesnt have a banner so it is difficult to spot if you dont know where it is. Foie gras poutine. Very good, the foie gras melted in with the poutine and you were able to taste the foie gras. The texture or the plate was consistant, there was cheesy, crispy and then the foie gras made it very good. you were able to taste that the fries were fried in the duck fat and the gravy was creamy and rich. with that being said, a very good dish but will get heavy and sickening after you eat too much of it.Foie gras a la champlain. foie gras on top of a thick slice of bacon, on a bed of thin crispy potato pancake (like a thin hashbrown), topped with a generous amount of maple syrup sauce. First bite was veryyyyy good!! So cripsy from the potato, the bacon was thick and the foie gras was enhanced in this plate, the maple syrup sauce was a good amount of sweet and salty. But this is definitely not a plate you eat on your own, its best for sharing because after a while the taste and maple syrup is quite overwhelming. table side Squash risotto. risotto was cooked very well but since it was table side she made it in the a large parmesan cheese, mixed it all together. She over poured the chicken broth and the risotto became a soup. The waiter asked how it was and I told him honestly that I did not like it because it was too watery. He left then about 3-4 mins later he asked me "do you want me to take it to the chef to try it", well no obviously not! She should have known when she served it because it was clearly too watery. He knew I was unhappy and he was the one that was pushing for this squash risotto, he didnt do anything to make up for the bad dish. At a resto like that I would expect so much more. Overall, theres definitely better. I'm glad I tried it but I would not be returning.We made the reservation two weeks ago. Probably because it's weekday, we are the only customers at 5:00pm.We didn't drink alcohol, only a bottle of water. The water is in glass bottle, taste better than thesame brand in plastic bottle.Tarragon Bison Tongue is the first dish. The tongue is from beef. Mr. Tang said it's good. I prefer the pickle, since I didn't try the tongue.Catch of the day, we picked the smoked eel. It also served with a piece of veal bone, you can eat the marrow(not sure if it's this word...).Fg poutine is great, although foie gras is too greasy for me.The duck in a can is great too. The duck is juicy and fresh, also with blood. The veggie taste a bit sour, really savory.The one missing star is for the dessert. Both icecream and pecan pie are too sweet for me to enjoy.After much hype, I made it here with a few colleagues on a Wednesday evening. The place was absolutely hopping and hard to get into, but we made a reservation a few weeks in advance.Once inside we sat at the bar, which is by far the best seat in the house. It comes with a direct view of the kitchen and all the goodness the chefs are whipping up. We started out with the ham special for appetizer, which was delicious. It came with a baguette and butter which made it perfect. We then had some poutine, which was also quite good. It was definitely better quality than most poutine dishes. For the main course, I went aggressive and got a mixed bowl consisting of blood sausage, pork sausage, mushrooms and onions sitting on top of mashed potatoes. The dish was very good, but not the amazing experience I was hoping for. Spices could have been a little better, but make no mistake it was a very good dish.With its popular reputation, upbeat atmosphere and good food, this is definitely a place worth visiting when in town. They also have a really good bar with interesting drinks. Great overall experience.Delicious food and a must if you're in Montreal. Come in hungry bc you'll get a rich and hearty meal. We ordered the infamous duck in a can, mushroom tortellini (tonites special), the steamed dumplings & plogue a Champlain "foie gras breakfast" - which was the highlight of the night. buckwheat pancake,  thick Canadian bacon, potatoes and cheese topped with foie gras. I wish it was one of the earlier items delivered I would have enjoyed a few more bites. Would def come here with a group to be able to taste more items on the menu. It's a busy restaurant so do make reservations. We scored 9:30 pm reservations on a Sunday night and place was packed with ppl still coming in with reservations after us. Service was slow and we had a really long wait b/t entrees coming out. We didn't leave until after 11:30. Luckily for us, our toddler was still on California time and was cooperative.Visit Montreal for a weekend and made a reservation two weeks in advance. Not too hard: I left a voicemail and someone called me back the next day. Between my friend and I, we ordered:- cromesquis de foie gras, basically deep fried fg. For $4, it was worth it. - temaki tartare, tartare Japanese hand roll. They didn't have bison available and we were offered veal. I quite enjoyed the layers of flavour and texture. - carpaccio de canard, duck carpaccio. My second favorite of the night. - and finally, poutine au foie gras. I hate to say it but this was a bit of a disappointment. I'm a fan of fg but this didn't have the ah-ha for me. We went later in the evening and 2 of the 3 cocktails were already sold out. My reco would be to go early. We also had a lot of trouble finding this place late at night. You really have to know what the front looks like!If you love pork and foie gras, this place is heaven. Recommend getting the foie gras poutine and the duck in a can. We also ordered the onion soup, duck carpaccio and the dumplings.Onion soup - your standard cheesy onion soup done right. Super tasty. Foie gras Poutine - must get!! Abundance of extra buttery and fatty foie gras with fries and gravy. This is a heavy dish so great for sharing and having a cold beer. Duck carpaccio - the presentation of the dish was beautiful. Thinly slice duck with chives, raw mushrooms and a yolk. Duck in a can - must get as well! The waiter brings over the can and opens it in front of the table. The content of the can contains the small duck, foie gras, cabbage which is all poured over the bread with carrot purée. The meat was tender and succulent.The service was very good - our waiter was extremely nice and helpful in making suggestions. There are so many options to choose from so it's great if you come with a big group and share everything!This place is insanely delicious.  The restaurant is a bit tight on space but the kitchen is opened. You can actually hear the staff call out orders.  There are so many options that we probably over ordered for two people!! For starters, we had poutine with foie gras, duck carpaccio and beef tongue.  For entrees we had the duck in a can and the blood sausage tart.  The duck in the can was amazing! We totally over did it on the foie gras but you only live once! We had so much foodWe had to call ahead so the restaurant could accommodate our baby.I went with a southern French person to this restaurant but he did not completely agree with my assessment. Just a caveat. :-)We really wanted to try a Montreal special, as this place is very well known. This place has the famous foie gras poutine and Duck in a Can. We decided to all share to try a few more dishes. The baguette is good!The ambience is nice. We went right when it opened and there was a small line waiting. You cannot get seated if you have not made a reservation. Plan ahead. 1. Garden salad: not on the menu, but we figured we were having so many animal parts this was probably a good idea. $15 for generic salad. The salad was fresh but basic. 2. Mushroom risotto: this dish is very expensive for what it is, but you get a show. They come to your table with a large cheese bowl and add the risotto, mushroom, and even Canadian bacon. This dish had potential but was much too salty. It was hard to finish. 3. Terragon Bison tongue: this is tongue well done. The texture is very soft, which is impressive given the quality of most tongues. The sauces and everything just work well together. However, it's game-y so just be warned. 4. Foie gras poutine: loved it. The fries were good. The gravy was also good. The foie gras was in large blocks and was nice and fatty. I think if you come here, you should get this dish! 5. Duck in a Can: I loved watching them pour half a duck out of a can. Life experience. It even looked nice coming out. The duck came out as a thick filet attached to a flap of lard and also fatty liver (foie gras). I enjoyed this dish very much. It was over puréed cauliflower. The issue I had was that the duck meat was very thick. I had to eat it with slices of the lard to complement the taste. Overall a good dish. 6. Dessert: we got the maple cake and the lemon pie. Both were pretty good. Get the maple cake for novelty sake! Very sweet but good flavors. It was a pricy meal, but for a specialty restaurant it made sense.When my friend and I were certain we wanted to try Au Pied de Cochon, I tried to make reservation (1 week in advance) but their voicemail box was full... I didn't know what to do except, trying to call in the following days... And finally, 2 days before the date we wanted to go, I was finally able to make a reservation (but there weren't any tables left, and the lady asked me if it was okay to be seated at the counter/bar, which I was fine with).Being seated at the counter/bar was actually one exciting experience since we were able to watch the chefs cook and take a glance at all the dishes other customers ordered! It was really mind-blowing watching them cook in a fast-moving environment! I really liked their open-kitchen. It was also fun to guess whether the dish was ours or not too (it was our first time at Au Pied de Cochon, so we didn't know what to expect!)Before coming to Au Pied de Cochon, I searched other people's reviews and made my mind that I wanted to try their Duck in a Can! And this was one of the two dishes we ordered. We didn't know what to order next and my friend thought the The PDC Melting Pot has an interesting name, so we ordered that! Our waiter served us bread and butter (we didn't eat a lot since we wanted to save the tummy for our main courses, but the bread was not too hard, it was perfect!)Duck in a Can: Ordered it like I said because a lot of reviews said it is a must there! It is without doubt an interesting and fun dish. It came in a heated can (like how the name of the dish suggested). So, the waiter brought it over and opened it in front of you, poured the content out of the can (which contains the duck breast, 100g of foie gras, cabbages, the sauce) over the bread with carrot and cauliflower purée. The meat was really tender and it went very well with the cabbage, especially when you eat it with a small piece of duck meat. I actually really like the cabbage! It balanced the richness of the duck meat and foie gras very well. The fat under the duck meat was so chewy (I like chewy stuff) but the other fat part was.... I didn't like it since it was too greasy but some people like the feeling of fat melting in the mouth. We finished the dish (expect for the fat part) since it was too much for us.Duck in a can was quite an experience to be honest, it might not be my favorite dish due to its richness and especially oiliness but it was definitely an unique and interesting experience due to the presentation of the dish in a can!PDC Melting Pot:We actually preferred the melting pot because the taste wasn't as heavy as Duck in a Can and the pot was full of surprises, which made it more interesting. This dish came in a pot which was already hinted with its name! There was pork sausages, shiitake mushrooms, buttery potato cheese which was like mashed potatoes with cheese at the bottom, blood sausage -boudin but it is not like the Asian style one-, pork belly (so yummy!), pork loin and onions. There were a lot of things inside the pot; a lots of surprises! I absolutely loved the "buttery potato cheese", it was so delicious and well-made! The pork was tender and everything in this pot went extremely well with the mashed potatoes! The onion sauce was perfect too! It was a rich dish but not overwhelming like Duck in a Can.We also ordered their Milkshake XXX. My thought of my first sip: this is quite sweet... But afterwards, it got better! I don't know what was inside this milkshake... It tasted like rum (I'm not sure if it contained alcohol though). This was one rich milkshake I would say!We were basically in a food coma after this! I would definitely like to come back again and try their bison tongue (saw good reviews about it!)P.S: Make sure to make a reservation!!! Keep on trying even when their voicemail box is full!Service is outstanding. The employees are so attentive and seem to really love their jobs. Food it also outstanding and some of the best I have had in Montreal. I will say the food is really heavy and I don't want to think about the fat and calories. You'll probably walk out having eaten 2000 calories and well over 50 grams of fat, per person. Then again, if you really care about that stuff, subways right around the corner. Treat yourself, check it out. You will not be disappointed.We came to celebrate my husband's birthday. We reserved via email. It's the easiest way. I highly recommend reserving this way. I do not recommend going on Sunday's. They're out of everything. They were out of a few items. I didn't care for some, but being out of Ribs, Sweetbread, and BEER?! That was very disappointing. I ended up getting the famous Duck in a Can. Great flavour. Very delicious. Duck cooked to perfection. Then the Ragout. I liked the texture and how all the ingredients complimented each other, but it was wayyy too salty. I loved how it was prepared in a cheese block in front of us. Our waitress was rude and short with everything. Uninformative. We felt very rushed by her. Pretty much everything sucked but the Duck in a Can. I will come back and perhaps the experience will be better to tie with the good food.One of the best restaurants I have ever been to (if not the best).I had the duck in a can and my friend the risotto.The risotto is mixed in inside a large parmeggiano cheesw block and the duck is cooked inside the can for 27 minutes to a perfect taste.What an experienceService was great too!!Ouff getting a reservation at au PdeC was not an easy task ... who still operates over voicemail? Especially over a voicemail box that is always full?!But au PdeC still seems to get away with it thanks to all the hype Anthony Bourdain created during his 24 hour Montreal layover (if you've never watched it: dailymotion.com/.../xo2k…...).Needless to say, we had to try it out ourselves or we couldn't be called true Montrealers. But the overwhelming foie gras stuffed courses were too much for two people to handle, so we brought 2 friends for back up! All in all, if you come knowing that this will not be a fine dining experience and that you WILL be overindulging in rich and heavy courses, then your experience will be a satisfying one. And let's be honest, everything just tastes better with fat!From the foie gras stuffed croquettes that just ooze in your mouth as you bite into them, to the decadent poutine topped with foie gras gravy and a whole piece of foie gras and then the squash risotto cooked in a whole wheel of parmesan...! Your reward center will be firing away happy signals for hours to come smile emoticonAll this goodness, paired with a nice bottle of french wine (they have an extensive french heavy wine list and some good beer on tap) made this a highly enjoyable 'tourist in your own city experience'. Good food, good wine and great company along with a surprisingly affordable tab... what's not to like?Heard lots of great reviews for Au Pied de Cochon. This restaurant was featured on one of the shows by Anthony Bourdain! Service was excellent.DRINKS:Pied de Cochon beer x 2TERRAINE OF FOIE GRAS (4/5)Came with jam and bread. So delicious - it's pure foie gras. The taste is very strong and flavourful. A must for foie gras lovers :) I actually enjoyed this dish better without adding the jam on my slice of bread.FOIE GRAS POUTINE (5/5)A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! The closer you are to Montreal, the better the poutine gets and this one is a 5-star poutine for sure! Large slices of foie gras and big chunks of cheese.. mm fatty good!DUCK IN A CAN (5/5)So creative! It's a mini show when the waiter comes over and open the can in front of us (I recorded it all haha). The duck meat was tender and juicy - delicious. I would order this again the next time I visit Au Pied de Cochon.This place is the epitome of French Canadian cuisine. If you want an authentic Canadian culinary experience then this is not to be missed. The food is not for the faint of hearts and definitely leave your vegetarian friends at home. I wouldn't say this is a good everyday-go-to kinda restaurant so come here when you have visitors from out of town or for a special occasion. On to our meal.

Both icecream and pecan pie are too sweet for me to enjoy.After much hype, I made it here with a few colleagues on a Wednesday evening. The place was absolutely hopping and hard to get into, but we made a reservation a few weeks in advance.Once inside we sat at the bar, which is by far the best seat in the house. It comes with a direct view of the kitchen and all the goodness the chefs are whipping up. We started out with the ham special for appetizer, which was delicious. It came with a baguette and butter which made it perfect. We then had some poutine, which was also quite good. It was definitely better quality than most poutine dishes. For the main course, I went aggressive and got a mixed bowl consisting of blood sausage, pork sausage, mushrooms and onions sitting on top of mashed potatoes. The dish was very good, but not the amazing experience I was hoping for. Spices could have been a little better, but make no mistake it was a very good dish.With its popular reputation, upbeat atmosphere and good food, this is definitely a place worth visiting when in town. They also have a really good bar with interesting drinks. Great overall experience.Delicious food and a must if you're in Montreal. Come in hungry bc you'll get a rich and hearty meal. We ordered the infamous duck in a can, mushroom tortellini (tonites special), the steamed dumplings & plogue a Champlain "foie gras breakfast" - which was the highlight of the night. buckwheat pancake,  thick Canadian bacon, potatoes and cheese topped with foie gras. I wish it was one of the earlier items delivered I would have enjoyed a few more bites. Would def come here with a group to be able to taste more items on the menu. It's a busy restaurant so do make reservations. We scored 9:30 pm reservations on a Sunday night and place was packed with ppl still coming in with reservations after us. Service was slow and we had a really long wait b/t entrees coming out. We didn't leave until after 11:30. Luckily for us, our toddler was still on California time and was cooperative.Visit Montreal for a weekend and made a reservation two weeks in advance. Not too hard: I left a voicemail and someone called me back the next day. Between my friend and I, we ordered:- cromesquis de foie gras, basically deep fried fg. For $4, it was worth it. - temaki tartare, tartare Japanese hand roll. They didn't have bison available and we were offered veal. I quite enjoyed the layers of flavour and texture. - carpaccio de canard, duck carpaccio. My second favorite of the night. - and finally, poutine au foie gras. I hate to say it but this was a bit of a disappointment. I'm a fan of fg but this didn't have the ah-ha for me. We went later in the evening and 2 of the 3 cocktails were already sold out. My reco would be to go early. We also had a lot of trouble finding this place late at night. You really have to know what the front looks like!If you love pork and foie gras, this place is heaven. Recommend getting the foie gras poutine and the duck in a can. We also ordered the onion soup, duck carpaccio and the dumplings.Onion soup - your standard cheesy onion soup done right. Super tasty. Foie gras Poutine - must get!! Abundance of extra buttery and fatty foie gras with fries and gravy. This is a heavy dish so great for sharing and having a cold beer. Duck carpaccio - the presentation of the dish was beautiful. Thinly slice duck with chives, raw mushrooms and a yolk. Duck in a can - must get as well! The waiter brings over the can and opens it in front of the table. The content of the can contains the small duck, foie gras, cabbage which is all poured over the bread with carrot purée. The meat was tender and succulent.The service was very good - our waiter was extremely nice and helpful in making suggestions. There are so many options to choose from so it's great if you come with a big group and share everything!This place is insanely delicious.  The restaurant is a bit tight on space but the kitchen is opened. You can actually hear the staff call out orders.  There are so many options that we probably over ordered for two people!! For starters, we had poutine with foie gras, duck carpaccio and beef tongue.  For entrees we had the duck in a can and the blood sausage tart.  The duck in the can was amazing! We totally over did it on the foie gras but you only live once! We had so much foodWe had to call ahead so the restaurant could accommodate our baby.I went with a southern French person to this restaurant but he did not completely agree with my assessment. Just a caveat. :-)We really wanted to try a Montreal special, as this place is very well known. This place has the famous foie gras poutine and Duck in a Can. We decided to all share to try a few more dishes. The baguette is good!The ambience is nice. We went right when it opened and there was a small line waiting. You cannot get seated if you have not made a reservation. Plan ahead. 1. Garden salad: not on the menu, but we figured we were having so many animal parts this was probably a good idea. $15 for generic salad. The salad was fresh but basic. 2. Mushroom risotto: this dish is very expensive for what it is, but you get a show. They come to your table with a large cheese bowl and add the risotto, mushroom, and even Canadian bacon. This dish had potential but was much too salty. It was hard to finish. 3. Terragon Bison tongue: this is tongue well done. The texture is very soft, which is impressive given the quality of most tongues. The sauces and everything just work well together. However, it's game-y so just be warned. 4. Foie gras poutine: loved it. The fries were good. The gravy was also good. The foie gras was in large blocks and was nice and fatty. I think if you come here, you should get this dish! 5. Duck in a Can: I loved watching them pour half a duck out of a can. Life experience. It even looked nice coming out. The duck came out as a thick filet attached to a flap of lard and also fatty liver (foie gras). I enjoyed this dish very much. It was over puréed cauliflower. The issue I had was that the duck meat was very thick. I had to eat it with slices of the lard to complement the taste. Overall a good dish. 6. Dessert: we got the maple cake and the lemon pie. Both were pretty good. Get the maple cake for novelty sake! Very sweet but good flavors. It was a pricy meal, but for a specialty restaurant it made sense.When my friend and I were certain we wanted to try Au Pied de Cochon, I tried to make reservation (1 week in advance) but their voicemail box was full... I didn't know what to do except, trying to call in the following days... And finally, 2 days before the date we wanted to go, I was finally able to make a reservation (but there weren't any tables left, and the lady asked me if it was okay to be seated at the counter/bar, which I was fine with).Being seated at the counter/bar was actually one exciting experience since we were able to watch the chefs cook and take a glance at all the dishes other customers ordered! It was really mind-blowing watching them cook in a fast-moving environment! I really liked their open-kitchen. It was also fun to guess whether the dish was ours or not too (it was our first time at Au Pied de Cochon, so we didn't know what to expect!)Before coming to Au Pied de Cochon, I searched other people's reviews and made my mind that I wanted to try their Duck in a Can! And this was one of the two dishes we ordered. We didn't know what to order next and my friend thought the The PDC Melting Pot has an interesting name, so we ordered that! Our waiter served us bread and butter (we didn't eat a lot since we wanted to save the tummy for our main courses, but the bread was not too hard, it was perfect!)Duck in a Can: Ordered it like I said because a lot of reviews said it is a must there! It is without doubt an interesting and fun dish. It came in a heated can (like how the name of the dish suggested). So, the waiter brought it over and opened it in front of you, poured the content out of the can (which contains the duck breast, 100g of foie gras, cabbages, the sauce) over the bread with carrot and cauliflower purée. The meat was really tender and it went very well with the cabbage, especially when you eat it with a small piece of duck meat. I actually really like the cabbage! It balanced the richness of the duck meat and foie gras very well. The fat under the duck meat was so chewy (I like chewy stuff) but the other fat part was.... I didn't like it since it was too greasy but some people like the feeling of fat melting in the mouth. We finished the dish (expect for the fat part) since it was too much for us.Duck in a can was quite an experience to be honest, it might not be my favorite dish due to its richness and especially oiliness but it was definitely an unique and interesting experience due to the presentation of the dish in a can!PDC Melting Pot:We actually preferred the melting pot because the taste wasn't as heavy as Duck in a Can and the pot was full of surprises, which made it more interesting. This dish came in a pot which was already hinted with its name! There was pork sausages, shiitake mushrooms, buttery potato cheese which was like mashed potatoes with cheese at the bottom, blood sausage -boudin but it is not like the Asian style one-, pork belly (so yummy!), pork loin and onions. There were a lot of things inside the pot; a lots of surprises! I absolutely loved the "buttery potato cheese", it was so delicious and well-made! The pork was tender and everything in this pot went extremely well with the mashed potatoes! The onion sauce was perfect too! It was a rich dish but not overwhelming like Duck in a Can.We also ordered their Milkshake XXX. My thought of my first sip: this is quite sweet... But afterwards, it got better! I don't know what was inside this milkshake... It tasted like rum (I'm not sure if it contained alcohol though). This was one rich milkshake I would say!We were basically in a food coma after this! I would definitely like to come back again and try their bison tongue (saw good reviews about it!)P.S: Make sure to make a reservation!!! Keep on trying even when their voicemail box is full!Service is outstanding. The employees are so attentive and seem to really love their jobs. Food it also outstanding and some of the best I have had in Montreal. I will say the food is really heavy and I don't want to think about the fat and calories. You'll probably walk out having eaten 2000 calories and well over 50 grams of fat, per person. Then again, if you really care about that stuff, subways right around the corner. Treat yourself, check it out. You will not be disappointed.We came to celebrate my husband's birthday. We reserved via email. It's the easiest way. I highly recommend reserving this way. I do not recommend going on Sunday's. They're out of everything. They were out of a few items. I didn't care for some, but being out of Ribs, Sweetbread, and BEER?! That was very disappointing. I ended up getting the famous Duck in a Can. Great flavour. Very delicious. Duck cooked to perfection. Then the Ragout. I liked the texture and how all the ingredients complimented each other, but it was wayyy too salty. I loved how it was prepared in a cheese block in front of us. Our waitress was rude and short with everything. Uninformative. We felt very rushed by her. Pretty much everything sucked but the Duck in a Can. I will come back and perhaps the experience will be better to tie with the good food.One of the best restaurants I have ever been to (if not the best).I had the duck in a can and my friend the risotto.The risotto is mixed in inside a large parmeggiano cheesw block and the duck is cooked inside the can for 27 minutes to a perfect taste.What an experienceService was great too!!Ouff getting a reservation at au PdeC was not an easy task ... who still operates over voicemail? Especially over a voicemail box that is always full?!But au PdeC still seems to get away with it thanks to all the hype Anthony Bourdain created during his 24 hour Montreal layover (if you've never watched it: dailymotion.com/.../xo2k…...).Needless to say, we had to try it out ourselves or we couldn't be called true Montrealers. But the overwhelming foie gras stuffed courses were too much for two people to handle, so we brought 2 friends for back up! All in all, if you come knowing that this will not be a fine dining experience and that you WILL be overindulging in rich and heavy courses, then your experience will be a satisfying one. And let's be honest, everything just tastes better with fat!From the foie gras stuffed croquettes that just ooze in your mouth as you bite into them, to the decadent poutine topped with foie gras gravy and a whole piece of foie gras and then the squash risotto cooked in a whole wheel of parmesan...! Your reward center will be firing away happy signals for hours to come smile emoticonAll this goodness, paired with a nice bottle of french wine (they have an extensive french heavy wine list and some good beer on tap) made this a highly enjoyable 'tourist in your own city experience'. Good food, good wine and great company along with a surprisingly affordable tab... what's not to like?Heard lots of great reviews for Au Pied de Cochon. This restaurant was featured on one of the shows by Anthony Bourdain! Service was excellent.DRINKS:Pied de Cochon beer x 2TERRAINE OF FOIE GRAS (4/5)Came with jam and bread. So delicious - it's pure foie gras. The taste is very strong and flavourful. A must for foie gras lovers :) I actually enjoyed this dish better without adding the jam on my slice of bread.FOIE GRAS POUTINE (5/5)A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! The closer you are to Montreal, the better the poutine gets and this one is a 5-star poutine for sure! Large slices of foie gras and big chunks of cheese.. mm fatty good!DUCK IN A CAN (5/5)So creative! It's a mini show when the waiter comes over and open the can in front of us (I recorded it all haha). The duck meat was tender and juicy - delicious. I would order this again the next time I visit Au Pied de Cochon.This place is the epitome of French Canadian cuisine. If you want an authentic Canadian culinary experience then this is not to be missed. The food is not for the faint of hearts and definitely leave your vegetarian friends at home. I wouldn't say this is a good everyday-go-to kinda restaurant so come here when you have visitors from out of town or for a special occasion. On to our meal. After cleansing our palettes with foie gras croquettes, we were ready for our main event. We bravely ordered the whole pig's head for two and I can say that it has been one of my most memorable meals. The head of pig was roasted to glistening perfection. Paired with apple and root veggies, the whole plate was full of flavour and tender juicy porky deliciousness. Since they have an open kitchen, people took pictures of our food as it made its way towards our table. It was quite the show! Have to admit I couldn't eat pork for a couple of weeks after but it was definitely worth every bite. Eating at Au Pied is a special event you don't want to miss.Do you love ducks? Or better yet, do you hate ducks? To the point where you'll eat ducks in every form for 3 different dishes? If so, Au Pied de Cochon is just what the doctor ordered.Sure, the name translates to the pig's feet, but the duck is where it's at.Foie gras poutine is about as rich and delicious as it sounds.The duck in a can (which COMES WITH FOIE GRAS) is also a must. Just watching the waiter take a can opener to it and drop it onto a plate is a thing of beauty. The entire can is boiled and then brought out. All the spices are infused and all the fattiness is preserved without getting boiled off. Super unique. Just don't overdo it. One can is probably enough for 3-4 people unless you REALLY want to feel unhealthy.We also got a side of duck fat fries, because WHY THE HELL NOT?There were 8 of us, so we did a few other entrees as well. One was the PDC's cut, which the waiter told us was a boneless pork chop (there was a bone). It looked dry, but it was actually incredibly moist. It was a gigantic hunk of meat too.We also did one of the specials - the Ahi tuna steak for two. Let me tell you, it was NOT for two. Maybe if you fasted and that was the only thing you ate that day. But it was also good. Perfectly rare, with a ton of veggies and cheese on the side. It was probably our least favorite of the dishes, but even still, it was very well done.We were seated all the way in the back by the wine cellar, so it was a bit of a tight squeeze (especially with another large group next to us), but there wasn't much else to complain about. They also have one hell of a wine list.Our waiter was super cool and gave us shots to round out the night.Probably one of the best meals I've ever had. Also, why I came back to the States with none of pants fitting anymore.Make reservations! Either call/email or reserve online. It's a must. Also come hungry, because, they serve a lot of food.This place gets super packed during the dinner rush. Even dining at the counter gets full.I'd recommend the foie gras duo to get the best out of APC. If you're dining with friends, then I'm sure you can taste each other's food. But for a single diner like myself, the foie gras duo comes with Foie Gras burger and foie gras poutine fries. Huge portions for about $50. Very fatty, very rich, and very good.I started off with the tuna tartare as an appetizer, but even though it is a small portion, I couldn't get through my foie gras duo because of the enormity of the portions. The tuna tartare was tarty and fresh.And I still wanted dessert after and I chose the toffee maple milk shake. They made it right in front me...I guess because I was in the counter, but you can see all the fatty goodness when they make this. Not to sweet, but I had enough room to finish it. I would order this again.Trying to find street parking might be hard for you during dinner time. And the metro station is several blocks away. You can probably try the bixi bikes if you have time to roam around this part of the Montreal neighborhood.Drip Drip Drip4 star for food and service but -0.5 star for all the water dripping from the vent on top of my head all through my dinner.Drip Drip Dip I know it was one of the hottest weekend in Montreal. It was end of July after all and I should be thankful for the nice cool interior of the restaurant with their AC on full blast. But with the water dripping on me the whole time (2 hour) while I was enjoying my dinner was not cool. The staff was all trying their best to stop the dripping from top of the AC vent which ran across the full depth of the restaurant by a squeegee sponge but it was not working....Drip Drip DripDinner was really good!! Excellent!We shared Tarragon Bison Tongue ($8.50) - I just love the Cornichon in that! And now I have a bottle in my fridge at home!Pâté de Campagne ($9) - So smooth and rich!Duck Carpaccio ($14) - Well seasoned, my first time having duck carpaccioDuck in a Can ($44) - So overhyped! The duck was dry and just not good! Foie Gras was so so. I don't believe I said that but I preferred mine seared...Braised Pig Feet with Side Pasta ($50) Seasonal - Must Order!! It was so tender and flavoured!! And the pasta which was prepared table side was so good! Perfect al dente and with BACON... Drip Drip DripI would have up my star to a 4 because the food was just amazing and the service was excellent. But the management really need to do something about their cooling system. I definitely would be back! PS The reservation system just got so much better as my reservation was confirmed by email and no need to play phone tag again!We had the foie gras poutine, stuffed pied de cochon with foie gras and a tuna dish. All were very rich in flavor and will lead to a heart attack BUT worth every bite. Poutine- get it! after all it is a Canadian dishStuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras- this is large enough for 3-4 people to share, the best part about this dish was the MASHED POTATO, it is sooooooooo good! it has a different texture from the typical mushy mashed potato. Tuna dish- our waiter picked this for us so I don't know what it's called but it's a pretty good dish with gravy and mashed potato on the bottom but it was a little salty though. Overall, amazing FATTY French Canadian food.Very rich food. If you like your food too creamy or too buttery, then this is your type of food. Everything was just very heavy and I couldn't seem to finish the dish. The FG is actually not bad as this was my first time tasting it. Definitely not something I would typically eat but at least I tried it! Plogue Champlain $29Pork filet $30Fg hamburger $39Squash risotto $24Fg poutine $24Eel tart $14The place was jam packed and there's absolutely no room to move if you're sitting on the outside of the table. Service is slow because of how busy it is. Might take you 10min to get the attention of a waitress and another 10 for the bill. Overall definitely a place to try but not something I would do again as its not really my type of food fare.I am judging overall as a meal and the service. First off, the place doesnt have a banner so it is difficult to spot if you dont know where it is. Foie gras poutine. Very good, the foie gras melted in with the poutine and you were able to taste the foie gras. The texture or the plate was consistant, there was cheesy, crispy and then the foie gras made it very good. you were able to taste that the fries were fried in the duck fat and the gravy was creamy and rich. with that being said, a very good dish but will get heavy and sickening after you eat too much of it.Foie gras a la champlain. foie gras on top of a thick slice of bacon, on a bed of thin crispy potato pancake (like a thin hashbrown), topped with a generous amount of maple syrup sauce. First bite was veryyyyy good!! So cripsy from the potato, the bacon was thick and the foie gras was enhanced in this plate, the maple syrup sauce was a good amount of sweet and salty. But this is definitely not a plate you eat on your own, its best for sharing because after a while the taste and maple syrup is quite overwhelming. table side Squash risotto. risotto was cooked very well but since it was table side she made it in the a large parmesan cheese, mixed it all together. She over poured the chicken broth and the risotto became a soup. The waiter asked how it was and I told him honestly that I did not like it because it was too watery. He left then about 3-4 mins later he asked me "do you want me to take it to the chef to try it", well no obviously not! She should have known when she served it because it was clearly too watery. He knew I was unhappy and he was the one that was pushing for this squash risotto, he didnt do anything to make up for the bad dish. At a resto like that I would expect so much more. Overall, theres definitely better. I'm glad I tried it but I would not be returning.We made the reservation two weeks ago. Probably because it's weekday, we are the only customers at 5:00pm.We didn't drink alcohol, only a bottle of water. The water is in glass bottle, taste better than thesame brand in plastic bottle.Tarragon Bison Tongue is the first dish. The tongue is from beef. Mr. Tang said it's good. I prefer the pickle, since I didn't try the tongue.Catch of the day, we picked the smoked eel. It also served with a piece of veal bone, you can eat the marrow(not sure if it's this word...).Fg poutine is great, although foie gras is too greasy for me.The duck in a can is great too. The duck is juicy and fresh, also with blood. The veggie taste a bit sour, really savory.The one missing star is for the dessert. Both icecream and pecan pie are too sweet for me to enjoy.After much hype, I made it here with a few colleagues on a Wednesday evening. The place was absolutely hopping and hard to get into, but we made a reservation a few weeks in advance.Once inside we sat at the bar, which is by far the best seat in the house.

It was a rich dish but not overwhelming like Duck in a Can.We also ordered their Milkshake XXX. My thought of my first sip: this is quite sweet... But afterwards, it got better! I don't know what was inside this milkshake... It tasted like rum (I'm not sure if it contained alcohol though). This was one rich milkshake I would say!We were basically in a food coma after this! I would definitely like to come back again and try their bison tongue (saw good reviews about it!)P.S: Make sure to make a reservation!!! Keep on trying even when their voicemail box is full!Service is outstanding. The employees are so attentive and seem to really love their jobs. Food it also outstanding and some of the best I have had in Montreal. I will say the food is really heavy and I don't want to think about the fat and calories. You'll probably walk out having eaten 2000 calories and well over 50 grams of fat, per person. Then again, if you really care about that stuff, subways right around the corner. Treat yourself, check it out. You will not be disappointed.We came to celebrate my husband's birthday. We reserved via email. It's the easiest way. I highly recommend reserving this way. I do not recommend going on Sunday's. They're out of everything. They were out of a few items. I didn't care for some, but being out of Ribs, Sweetbread, and BEER?! That was very disappointing. I ended up getting the famous Duck in a Can. Great flavour. Very delicious. Duck cooked to perfection. Then the Ragout. I liked the texture and how all the ingredients complimented each other, but it was wayyy too salty. I loved how it was prepared in a cheese block in front of us. Our waitress was rude and short with everything. Uninformative. We felt very rushed by her. Pretty much everything sucked but the Duck in a Can. I will come back and perhaps the experience will be better to tie with the good food.One of the best restaurants I have ever been to (if not the best).I had the duck in a can and my friend the risotto.The risotto is mixed in inside a large parmeggiano cheesw block and the duck is cooked inside the can for 27 minutes to a perfect taste.What an experienceService was great too!!Ouff getting a reservation at au PdeC was not an easy task ... who still operates over voicemail? Especially over a voicemail box that is always full?!But au PdeC still seems to get away with it thanks to all the hype Anthony Bourdain created during his 24 hour Montreal layover (if you've never watched it: dailymotion.com/.../xo2k…...).Needless to say, we had to try it out ourselves or we couldn't be called true Montrealers. But the overwhelming foie gras stuffed courses were too much for two people to handle, so we brought 2 friends for back up! All in all, if you come knowing that this will not be a fine dining experience and that you WILL be overindulging in rich and heavy courses, then your experience will be a satisfying one. And let's be honest, everything just tastes better with fat!From the foie gras stuffed croquettes that just ooze in your mouth as you bite into them, to the decadent poutine topped with foie gras gravy and a whole piece of foie gras and then the squash risotto cooked in a whole wheel of parmesan...! Your reward center will be firing away happy signals for hours to come smile emoticonAll this goodness, paired with a nice bottle of french wine (they have an extensive french heavy wine list and some good beer on tap) made this a highly enjoyable 'tourist in your own city experience'. Good food, good wine and great company along with a surprisingly affordable tab... what's not to like?Heard lots of great reviews for Au Pied de Cochon. This restaurant was featured on one of the shows by Anthony Bourdain! Service was excellent.DRINKS:Pied de Cochon beer x 2TERRAINE OF FOIE GRAS (4/5)Came with jam and bread. So delicious - it's pure foie gras. The taste is very strong and flavourful. A must for foie gras lovers :) I actually enjoyed this dish better without adding the jam on my slice of bread.FOIE GRAS POUTINE (5/5)A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! The closer you are to Montreal, the better the poutine gets and this one is a 5-star poutine for sure! Large slices of foie gras and big chunks of cheese.. mm fatty good!DUCK IN A CAN (5/5)So creative! It's a mini show when the waiter comes over and open the can in front of us (I recorded it all haha). The duck meat was tender and juicy - delicious. I would order this again the next time I visit Au Pied de Cochon.This place is the epitome of French Canadian cuisine. If you want an authentic Canadian culinary experience then this is not to be missed. The food is not for the faint of hearts and definitely leave your vegetarian friends at home. I wouldn't say this is a good everyday-go-to kinda restaurant so come here when you have visitors from out of town or for a special occasion. On to our meal. After cleansing our palettes with foie gras croquettes, we were ready for our main event. We bravely ordered the whole pig's head for two and I can say that it has been one of my most memorable meals. The head of pig was roasted to glistening perfection. Paired with apple and root veggies, the whole plate was full of flavour and tender juicy porky deliciousness. Since they have an open kitchen, people took pictures of our food as it made its way towards our table. It was quite the show! Have to admit I couldn't eat pork for a couple of weeks after but it was definitely worth every bite. Eating at Au Pied is a special event you don't want to miss.Do you love ducks? Or better yet, do you hate ducks? To the point where you'll eat ducks in every form for 3 different dishes? If so, Au Pied de Cochon is just what the doctor ordered.Sure, the name translates to the pig's feet, but the duck is where it's at.Foie gras poutine is about as rich and delicious as it sounds.The duck in a can (which COMES WITH FOIE GRAS) is also a must. Just watching the waiter take a can opener to it and drop it onto a plate is a thing of beauty. The entire can is boiled and then brought out. All the spices are infused and all the fattiness is preserved without getting boiled off. Super unique. Just don't overdo it. One can is probably enough for 3-4 people unless you REALLY want to feel unhealthy.We also got a side of duck fat fries, because WHY THE HELL NOT?There were 8 of us, so we did a few other entrees as well. One was the PDC's cut, which the waiter told us was a boneless pork chop (there was a bone). It looked dry, but it was actually incredibly moist. It was a gigantic hunk of meat too.We also did one of the specials - the Ahi tuna steak for two. Let me tell you, it was NOT for two. Maybe if you fasted and that was the only thing you ate that day. But it was also good. Perfectly rare, with a ton of veggies and cheese on the side. It was probably our least favorite of the dishes, but even still, it was very well done.We were seated all the way in the back by the wine cellar, so it was a bit of a tight squeeze (especially with another large group next to us), but there wasn't much else to complain about. They also have one hell of a wine list.Our waiter was super cool and gave us shots to round out the night.Probably one of the best meals I've ever had. Also, why I came back to the States with none of pants fitting anymore.Make reservations! Either call/email or reserve online. It's a must. Also come hungry, because, they serve a lot of food.This place gets super packed during the dinner rush. Even dining at the counter gets full.I'd recommend the foie gras duo to get the best out of APC. If you're dining with friends, then I'm sure you can taste each other's food. But for a single diner like myself, the foie gras duo comes with Foie Gras burger and foie gras poutine fries. Huge portions for about $50. Very fatty, very rich, and very good.I started off with the tuna tartare as an appetizer, but even though it is a small portion, I couldn't get through my foie gras duo because of the enormity of the portions. The tuna tartare was tarty and fresh.And I still wanted dessert after and I chose the toffee maple milk shake. They made it right in front me...I guess because I was in the counter, but you can see all the fatty goodness when they make this. Not to sweet, but I had enough room to finish it. I would order this again.Trying to find street parking might be hard for you during dinner time. And the metro station is several blocks away. You can probably try the bixi bikes if you have time to roam around this part of the Montreal neighborhood.Drip Drip Drip4 star for food and service but -0.5 star for all the water dripping from the vent on top of my head all through my dinner.Drip Drip Dip I know it was one of the hottest weekend in Montreal. It was end of July after all and I should be thankful for the nice cool interior of the restaurant with their AC on full blast. But with the water dripping on me the whole time (2 hour) while I was enjoying my dinner was not cool. The staff was all trying their best to stop the dripping from top of the AC vent which ran across the full depth of the restaurant by a squeegee sponge but it was not working....Drip Drip DripDinner was really good!! Excellent!We shared Tarragon Bison Tongue ($8.50) - I just love the Cornichon in that! And now I have a bottle in my fridge at home!Pâté de Campagne ($9) - So smooth and rich!Duck Carpaccio ($14) - Well seasoned, my first time having duck carpaccioDuck in a Can ($44) - So overhyped! The duck was dry and just not good! Foie Gras was so so. I don't believe I said that but I preferred mine seared...Braised Pig Feet with Side Pasta ($50) Seasonal - Must Order!! It was so tender and flavoured!! And the pasta which was prepared table side was so good! Perfect al dente and with BACON... Drip Drip DripI would have up my star to a 4 because the food was just amazing and the service was excellent. But the management really need to do something about their cooling system. I definitely would be back! PS The reservation system just got so much better as my reservation was confirmed by email and no need to play phone tag again!We had the foie gras poutine, stuffed pied de cochon with foie gras and a tuna dish. All were very rich in flavor and will lead to a heart attack BUT worth every bite. Poutine- get it! after all it is a Canadian dishStuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras- this is large enough for 3-4 people to share, the best part about this dish was the MASHED POTATO, it is sooooooooo good! it has a different texture from the typical mushy mashed potato. Tuna dish- our waiter picked this for us so I don't know what it's called but it's a pretty good dish with gravy and mashed potato on the bottom but it was a little salty though. Overall, amazing FATTY French Canadian food.Very rich food. If you like your food too creamy or too buttery, then this is your type of food. Everything was just very heavy and I couldn't seem to finish the dish. The FG is actually not bad as this was my first time tasting it. Definitely not something I would typically eat but at least I tried it! Plogue Champlain $29Pork filet $30Fg hamburger $39Squash risotto $24Fg poutine $24Eel tart $14The place was jam packed and there's absolutely no room to move if you're sitting on the outside of the table. Service is slow because of how busy it is. Might take you 10min to get the attention of a waitress and another 10 for the bill. Overall definitely a place to try but not something I would do again as its not really my type of food fare.I am judging overall as a meal and the service. First off, the place doesnt have a banner so it is difficult to spot if you dont know where it is. Foie gras poutine. Very good, the foie gras melted in with the poutine and you were able to taste the foie gras. The texture or the plate was consistant, there was cheesy, crispy and then the foie gras made it very good. you were able to taste that the fries were fried in the duck fat and the gravy was creamy and rich. with that being said, a very good dish but will get heavy and sickening after you eat too much of it.Foie gras a la champlain. foie gras on top of a thick slice of bacon, on a bed of thin crispy potato pancake (like a thin hashbrown), topped with a generous amount of maple syrup sauce. First bite was veryyyyy good!! So cripsy from the potato, the bacon was thick and the foie gras was enhanced in this plate, the maple syrup sauce was a good amount of sweet and salty. But this is definitely not a plate you eat on your own, its best for sharing because after a while the taste and maple syrup is quite overwhelming. table side Squash risotto. risotto was cooked very well but since it was table side she made it in the a large parmesan cheese, mixed it all together. She over poured the chicken broth and the risotto became a soup. The waiter asked how it was and I told him honestly that I did not like it because it was too watery. He left then about 3-4 mins later he asked me "do you want me to take it to the chef to try it", well no obviously not! She should have known when she served it because it was clearly too watery. He knew I was unhappy and he was the one that was pushing for this squash risotto, he didnt do anything to make up for the bad dish. At a resto like that I would expect so much more. Overall, theres definitely better. I'm glad I tried it but I would not be returning.We made the reservation two weeks ago. Probably because it's weekday, we are the only customers at 5:00pm.We didn't drink alcohol, only a bottle of water. The water is in glass bottle, taste better than thesame brand in plastic bottle.Tarragon Bison Tongue is the first dish. The tongue is from beef. Mr. Tang said it's good. I prefer the pickle, since I didn't try the tongue.Catch of the day, we picked the smoked eel. It also served with a piece of veal bone, you can eat the marrow(not sure if it's this word...).Fg poutine is great, although foie gras is too greasy for me.The duck in a can is great too. The duck is juicy and fresh, also with blood. The veggie taste a bit sour, really savory.The one missing star is for the dessert. Both icecream and pecan pie are too sweet for me to enjoy.After much hype, I made it here with a few colleagues on a Wednesday evening. The place was absolutely hopping and hard to get into, but we made a reservation a few weeks in advance.Once inside we sat at the bar, which is by far the best seat in the house. It comes with a direct view of the kitchen and all the goodness the chefs are whipping up. We started out with the ham special for appetizer, which was delicious. It came with a baguette and butter which made it perfect. We then had some poutine, which was also quite good. It was definitely better quality than most poutine dishes. For the main course, I went aggressive and got a mixed bowl consisting of blood sausage, pork sausage, mushrooms and onions sitting on top of mashed potatoes. The dish was very good, but not the amazing experience I was hoping for. Spices could have been a little better, but make no mistake it was a very good dish.With its popular reputation, upbeat atmosphere and good food, this is definitely a place worth visiting when in town. They also have a really good bar with interesting drinks. Great overall experience.Delicious food and a must if you're in Montreal. Come in hungry bc you'll get a rich and hearty meal. We ordered the infamous duck in a can, mushroom tortellini (tonites special), the steamed dumplings & plogue a Champlain "foie gras breakfast" - which was the highlight of the night. buckwheat pancake,  thick Canadian bacon, potatoes and cheese topped with foie gras. I wish it was one of the earlier items delivered I would have enjoyed a few more bites. Would def come here with a group to be able to taste more items on the menu. It's a busy restaurant so do make reservations. We scored 9:30 pm reservations on a Sunday night and place was packed with ppl still coming in with reservations after us. Service was slow and we had a really long wait b/t entrees coming out. We didn't leave until after 11:30. Luckily for us, our toddler was still on California time and was cooperative.Visit Montreal for a weekend and made a reservation two weeks in advance. Not too hard: I left a voicemail and someone called me back the next day. Between my friend and I, we ordered:- cromesquis de foie gras, basically deep fried fg. For $4, it was worth it. - temaki tartare, tartare Japanese hand roll. They didn't have bison available and we were offered veal. I quite enjoyed the layers of flavour and texture. - carpaccio de canard, duck carpaccio. My second favorite of the night. - and finally, poutine au foie gras. I hate to say it but this was a bit of a disappointment. I'm a fan of fg but this didn't have the ah-ha for me. We went later in the evening and 2 of the 3 cocktails were already sold out. My reco would be to go early. We also had a lot of trouble finding this place late at night. You really have to know what the front looks like!If you love pork and foie gras, this place is heaven. Recommend getting the foie gras poutine and the duck in a can. We also ordered the onion soup, duck carpaccio and the dumplings.Onion soup - your standard cheesy onion soup done right. Super tasty. Foie gras Poutine - must get!! Abundance of extra buttery and fatty foie gras with fries and gravy. This is a heavy dish so great for sharing and having a cold beer. Duck carpaccio - the presentation of the dish was beautiful. Thinly slice duck with chives, raw mushrooms and a yolk. Duck in a can - must get as well! The waiter brings over the can and opens it in front of the table. The content of the can contains the small duck, foie gras, cabbage which is all poured over the bread with carrot purée. The meat was tender and succulent.The service was very good - our waiter was extremely nice and helpful in making suggestions. There are so many options to choose from so it's great if you come with a big group and share everything!This place is insanely delicious.  The restaurant is a bit tight on space but the kitchen is opened. You can actually hear the staff call out orders.  There are so many options that we probably over ordered for two people!! For starters, we had poutine with foie gras, duck carpaccio and beef tongue.  For entrees we had the duck in a can and the blood sausage tart.  The duck in the can was amazing! We totally over did it on the foie gras but you only live once! We had so much foodWe had to call ahead so the restaurant could accommodate our baby.I went with a southern French person to this restaurant but he did not completely agree with my assessment. Just a caveat. :-)We really wanted to try a Montreal special, as this place is very well known. This place has the famous foie gras poutine and Duck in a Can. We decided to all share to try a few more dishes. The baguette is good!The ambience is nice. We went right when it opened and there was a small line waiting. You cannot get seated if you have not made a reservation. Plan ahead. 1. Garden salad: not on the menu, but we figured we were having so many animal parts this was probably a good idea. $15 for generic salad. The salad was fresh but basic. 2. Mushroom risotto: this dish is very expensive for what it is, but you get a show. They come to your table with a large cheese bowl and add the risotto, mushroom, and even Canadian bacon. This dish had potential but was much too salty. It was hard to finish. 3. Terragon Bison tongue: this is tongue well done. The texture is very soft, which is impressive given the quality of most tongues. The sauces and everything just work well together. However, it's game-y so just be warned. 4. Foie gras poutine: loved it. The fries were good. The gravy was also good. The foie gras was in large blocks and was nice and fatty. I think if you come here, you should get this dish! 5. Duck in a Can: I loved watching them pour half a duck out of a can. Life experience. It even looked nice coming out. The duck came out as a thick filet attached to a flap of lard and also fatty liver (foie gras). I enjoyed this dish very much. It was over puréed cauliflower. The issue I had was that the duck meat was very thick. I had to eat it with slices of the lard to complement the taste. Overall a good dish. 6. Dessert: we got the maple cake and the lemon pie. Both were pretty good. Get the maple cake for novelty sake! Very sweet but good flavors. It was a pricy meal, but for a specialty restaurant it made sense.When my friend and I were certain we wanted to try Au Pied de Cochon, I tried to make reservation (1 week in advance) but their voicemail box was full... I didn't know what to do except, trying to call in the following days... And finally, 2 days before the date we wanted to go, I was finally able to make a reservation (but there weren't any tables left, and the lady asked me if it was okay to be seated at the counter/bar, which I was fine with).Being seated at the counter/bar was actually one exciting experience since we were able to watch the chefs cook and take a glance at all the dishes other customers ordered! It was really mind-blowing watching them cook in a fast-moving environment! I really liked their open-kitchen. It was also fun to guess whether the dish was ours or not too (it was our first time at Au Pied de Cochon, so we didn't know what to expect!)Before coming to Au Pied de Cochon, I searched other people's reviews and made my mind that I wanted to try their Duck in a Can! And this was one of the two dishes we ordered. We didn't know what to order next and my friend thought the The PDC Melting Pot has an interesting name, so we ordered that! Our waiter served us bread and butter (we didn't eat a lot since we wanted to save the tummy for our main courses, but the bread was not too hard, it was perfect!)Duck in a Can: Ordered it like I said because a lot of reviews said it is a must there! It is without doubt an interesting and fun dish. It came in a heated can (like how the name of the dish suggested). So, the waiter brought it over and opened it in front of you, poured the content out of the can (which contains the duck breast, 100g of foie gras, cabbages, the sauce) over the bread with carrot and cauliflower purée. The meat was really tender and it went very well with the cabbage, especially when you eat it with a small piece of duck meat. I actually really like the cabbage! It balanced the richness of the duck meat and foie gras very well. The fat under the duck meat was so chewy (I like chewy stuff) but the other fat part was.... I didn't like it since it was too greasy but some people like the feeling of fat melting in the mouth. We finished the dish (expect for the fat part) since it was too much for us.Duck in a can was quite an experience to be honest, it might not be my favorite dish due to its richness and especially oiliness but it was definitely an unique and interesting experience due to the presentation of the dish in a can!PDC Melting Pot:We actually preferred the melting pot because the taste wasn't as heavy as Duck in a Can and the pot was full of surprises, which made it more interesting. This dish came in a pot which was already hinted with its name! There was pork sausages, shiitake mushrooms, buttery potato cheese which was like mashed potatoes with cheese at the bottom, blood sausage -boudin but it is not like the Asian style one-, pork belly (so yummy!), pork loin and onions. There were a lot of things inside the pot; a lots of surprises! I absolutely loved the "buttery potato cheese", it was so delicious and well-made! The pork was tender and everything in this pot went extremely well with the mashed potatoes! The onion sauce was perfect too! It was a rich dish but not overwhelming like Duck in a Can.We also ordered their Milkshake XXX. My thought of my first sip: this is quite sweet... But afterwards, it got better! I don't know what was inside this milkshake... It tasted like rum (I'm not sure if it contained alcohol though). This was one rich milkshake I would say!We were basically in a food coma after this! I would definitely like to come back again and try their bison tongue (saw good reviews about it!)P.S: Make sure to make a reservation!!! Keep on trying even when their voicemail box is full!Service is outstanding. The employees are so attentive and seem to really love their jobs. Food it also outstanding and some of the best I have had in Montreal. I will say the food is really heavy and I don't want to think about the fat and calories.

And now I have a bottle in my fridge at home!Pâté de Campagne ($9) - So smooth and rich!Duck Carpaccio ($14) - Well seasoned, my first time having duck carpaccioDuck in a Can ($44) - So overhyped! The duck was dry and just not good! Foie Gras was so so. I don't believe I said that but I preferred mine seared...Braised Pig Feet with Side Pasta ($50) Seasonal - Must Order!! It was so tender and flavoured!! And the pasta which was prepared table side was so good! Perfect al dente and with BACON... Drip Drip DripI would have up my star to a 4 because the food was just amazing and the service was excellent. But the management really need to do something about their cooling system. I definitely would be back! PS The reservation system just got so much better as my reservation was confirmed by email and no need to play phone tag again!We had the foie gras poutine, stuffed pied de cochon with foie gras and a tuna dish. All were very rich in flavor and will lead to a heart attack BUT worth every bite. Poutine- get it! after all it is a Canadian dishStuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras- this is large enough for 3-4 people to share, the best part about this dish was the MASHED POTATO, it is sooooooooo good! it has a different texture from the typical mushy mashed potato. Tuna dish- our waiter picked this for us so I don't know what it's called but it's a pretty good dish with gravy and mashed potato on the bottom but it was a little salty though. Overall, amazing FATTY French Canadian food.Very rich food. If you like your food too creamy or too buttery, then this is your type of food. Everything was just very heavy and I couldn't seem to finish the dish. The FG is actually not bad as this was my first time tasting it. Definitely not something I would typically eat but at least I tried it! Plogue Champlain $29Pork filet $30Fg hamburger $39Squash risotto $24Fg poutine $24Eel tart $14The place was jam packed and there's absolutely no room to move if you're sitting on the outside of the table. Service is slow because of how busy it is. Might take you 10min to get the attention of a waitress and another 10 for the bill. Overall definitely a place to try but not something I would do again as its not really my type of food fare.I am judging overall as a meal and the service. First off, the place doesnt have a banner so it is difficult to spot if you dont know where it is. Foie gras poutine. Very good, the foie gras melted in with the poutine and you were able to taste the foie gras. The texture or the plate was consistant, there was cheesy, crispy and then the foie gras made it very good. you were able to taste that the fries were fried in the duck fat and the gravy was creamy and rich. with that being said, a very good dish but will get heavy and sickening after you eat too much of it.Foie gras a la champlain. foie gras on top of a thick slice of bacon, on a bed of thin crispy potato pancake (like a thin hashbrown), topped with a generous amount of maple syrup sauce. First bite was veryyyyy good!! So cripsy from the potato, the bacon was thick and the foie gras was enhanced in this plate, the maple syrup sauce was a good amount of sweet and salty. But this is definitely not a plate you eat on your own, its best for sharing because after a while the taste and maple syrup is quite overwhelming. table side Squash risotto. risotto was cooked very well but since it was table side she made it in the a large parmesan cheese, mixed it all together. She over poured the chicken broth and the risotto became a soup. The waiter asked how it was and I told him honestly that I did not like it because it was too watery. He left then about 3-4 mins later he asked me "do you want me to take it to the chef to try it", well no obviously not! She should have known when she served it because it was clearly too watery. He knew I was unhappy and he was the one that was pushing for this squash risotto, he didnt do anything to make up for the bad dish. At a resto like that I would expect so much more. Overall, theres definitely better. I'm glad I tried it but I would not be returning.We made the reservation two weeks ago. Probably because it's weekday, we are the only customers at 5:00pm.We didn't drink alcohol, only a bottle of water. The water is in glass bottle, taste better than thesame brand in plastic bottle.Tarragon Bison Tongue is the first dish. The tongue is from beef. Mr. Tang said it's good. I prefer the pickle, since I didn't try the tongue.Catch of the day, we picked the smoked eel. It also served with a piece of veal bone, you can eat the marrow(not sure if it's this word...).Fg poutine is great, although foie gras is too greasy for me.The duck in a can is great too. The duck is juicy and fresh, also with blood. The veggie taste a bit sour, really savory.The one missing star is for the dessert. Both icecream and pecan pie are too sweet for me to enjoy.After much hype, I made it here with a few colleagues on a Wednesday evening. The place was absolutely hopping and hard to get into, but we made a reservation a few weeks in advance.Once inside we sat at the bar, which is by far the best seat in the house. It comes with a direct view of the kitchen and all the goodness the chefs are whipping up. We started out with the ham special for appetizer, which was delicious. It came with a baguette and butter which made it perfect. We then had some poutine, which was also quite good. It was definitely better quality than most poutine dishes. For the main course, I went aggressive and got a mixed bowl consisting of blood sausage, pork sausage, mushrooms and onions sitting on top of mashed potatoes. The dish was very good, but not the amazing experience I was hoping for. Spices could have been a little better, but make no mistake it was a very good dish.With its popular reputation, upbeat atmosphere and good food, this is definitely a place worth visiting when in town. They also have a really good bar with interesting drinks. Great overall experience.Delicious food and a must if you're in Montreal. Come in hungry bc you'll get a rich and hearty meal. We ordered the infamous duck in a can, mushroom tortellini (tonites special), the steamed dumplings & plogue a Champlain "foie gras breakfast" - which was the highlight of the night. buckwheat pancake,  thick Canadian bacon, potatoes and cheese topped with foie gras. I wish it was one of the earlier items delivered I would have enjoyed a few more bites. Would def come here with a group to be able to taste more items on the menu. It's a busy restaurant so do make reservations. We scored 9:30 pm reservations on a Sunday night and place was packed with ppl still coming in with reservations after us. Service was slow and we had a really long wait b/t entrees coming out. We didn't leave until after 11:30. Luckily for us, our toddler was still on California time and was cooperative.Visit Montreal for a weekend and made a reservation two weeks in advance. Not too hard: I left a voicemail and someone called me back the next day. Between my friend and I, we ordered:- cromesquis de foie gras, basically deep fried fg. For $4, it was worth it. - temaki tartare, tartare Japanese hand roll. They didn't have bison available and we were offered veal. I quite enjoyed the layers of flavour and texture. - carpaccio de canard, duck carpaccio. My second favorite of the night. - and finally, poutine au foie gras. I hate to say it but this was a bit of a disappointment. I'm a fan of fg but this didn't have the ah-ha for me. We went later in the evening and 2 of the 3 cocktails were already sold out. My reco would be to go early. We also had a lot of trouble finding this place late at night. You really have to know what the front looks like!If you love pork and foie gras, this place is heaven. Recommend getting the foie gras poutine and the duck in a can. We also ordered the onion soup, duck carpaccio and the dumplings.Onion soup - your standard cheesy onion soup done right. Super tasty. Foie gras Poutine - must get!! Abundance of extra buttery and fatty foie gras with fries and gravy. This is a heavy dish so great for sharing and having a cold beer. Duck carpaccio - the presentation of the dish was beautiful. Thinly slice duck with chives, raw mushrooms and a yolk. Duck in a can - must get as well! The waiter brings over the can and opens it in front of the table. The content of the can contains the small duck, foie gras, cabbage which is all poured over the bread with carrot purée. The meat was tender and succulent.The service was very good - our waiter was extremely nice and helpful in making suggestions. There are so many options to choose from so it's great if you come with a big group and share everything!This place is insanely delicious.  The restaurant is a bit tight on space but the kitchen is opened. You can actually hear the staff call out orders.  There are so many options that we probably over ordered for two people!! For starters, we had poutine with foie gras, duck carpaccio and beef tongue.  For entrees we had the duck in a can and the blood sausage tart.  The duck in the can was amazing! We totally over did it on the foie gras but you only live once! We had so much foodWe had to call ahead so the restaurant could accommodate our baby.I went with a southern French person to this restaurant but he did not completely agree with my assessment. Just a caveat. :-)We really wanted to try a Montreal special, as this place is very well known. This place has the famous foie gras poutine and Duck in a Can. We decided to all share to try a few more dishes. The baguette is good!The ambience is nice. We went right when it opened and there was a small line waiting. You cannot get seated if you have not made a reservation. Plan ahead. 1. Garden salad: not on the menu, but we figured we were having so many animal parts this was probably a good idea. $15 for generic salad. The salad was fresh but basic. 2. Mushroom risotto: this dish is very expensive for what it is, but you get a show. They come to your table with a large cheese bowl and add the risotto, mushroom, and even Canadian bacon. This dish had potential but was much too salty. It was hard to finish. 3. Terragon Bison tongue: this is tongue well done. The texture is very soft, which is impressive given the quality of most tongues. The sauces and everything just work well together. However, it's game-y so just be warned. 4. Foie gras poutine: loved it. The fries were good. The gravy was also good. The foie gras was in large blocks and was nice and fatty. I think if you come here, you should get this dish! 5. Duck in a Can: I loved watching them pour half a duck out of a can. Life experience. It even looked nice coming out. The duck came out as a thick filet attached to a flap of lard and also fatty liver (foie gras). I enjoyed this dish very much. It was over puréed cauliflower. The issue I had was that the duck meat was very thick. I had to eat it with slices of the lard to complement the taste. Overall a good dish. 6. Dessert: we got the maple cake and the lemon pie. Both were pretty good. Get the maple cake for novelty sake! Very sweet but good flavors. It was a pricy meal, but for a specialty restaurant it made sense.When my friend and I were certain we wanted to try Au Pied de Cochon, I tried to make reservation (1 week in advance) but their voicemail box was full... I didn't know what to do except, trying to call in the following days... And finally, 2 days before the date we wanted to go, I was finally able to make a reservation (but there weren't any tables left, and the lady asked me if it was okay to be seated at the counter/bar, which I was fine with).Being seated at the counter/bar was actually one exciting experience since we were able to watch the chefs cook and take a glance at all the dishes other customers ordered! It was really mind-blowing watching them cook in a fast-moving environment! I really liked their open-kitchen. It was also fun to guess whether the dish was ours or not too (it was our first time at Au Pied de Cochon, so we didn't know what to expect!)Before coming to Au Pied de Cochon, I searched other people's reviews and made my mind that I wanted to try their Duck in a Can! And this was one of the two dishes we ordered. We didn't know what to order next and my friend thought the The PDC Melting Pot has an interesting name, so we ordered that! Our waiter served us bread and butter (we didn't eat a lot since we wanted to save the tummy for our main courses, but the bread was not too hard, it was perfect!)Duck in a Can: Ordered it like I said because a lot of reviews said it is a must there! It is without doubt an interesting and fun dish. It came in a heated can (like how the name of the dish suggested). So, the waiter brought it over and opened it in front of you, poured the content out of the can (which contains the duck breast, 100g of foie gras, cabbages, the sauce) over the bread with carrot and cauliflower purée. The meat was really tender and it went very well with the cabbage, especially when you eat it with a small piece of duck meat. I actually really like the cabbage! It balanced the richness of the duck meat and foie gras very well. The fat under the duck meat was so chewy (I like chewy stuff) but the other fat part was.... I didn't like it since it was too greasy but some people like the feeling of fat melting in the mouth. We finished the dish (expect for the fat part) since it was too much for us.Duck in a can was quite an experience to be honest, it might not be my favorite dish due to its richness and especially oiliness but it was definitely an unique and interesting experience due to the presentation of the dish in a can!PDC Melting Pot:We actually preferred the melting pot because the taste wasn't as heavy as Duck in a Can and the pot was full of surprises, which made it more interesting. This dish came in a pot which was already hinted with its name! There was pork sausages, shiitake mushrooms, buttery potato cheese which was like mashed potatoes with cheese at the bottom, blood sausage -boudin but it is not like the Asian style one-, pork belly (so yummy!), pork loin and onions. There were a lot of things inside the pot; a lots of surprises! I absolutely loved the "buttery potato cheese", it was so delicious and well-made! The pork was tender and everything in this pot went extremely well with the mashed potatoes! The onion sauce was perfect too! It was a rich dish but not overwhelming like Duck in a Can.We also ordered their Milkshake XXX. My thought of my first sip: this is quite sweet... But afterwards, it got better! I don't know what was inside this milkshake... It tasted like rum (I'm not sure if it contained alcohol though). This was one rich milkshake I would say!We were basically in a food coma after this! I would definitely like to come back again and try their bison tongue (saw good reviews about it!)P.S: Make sure to make a reservation!!! Keep on trying even when their voicemail box is full!Service is outstanding. The employees are so attentive and seem to really love their jobs. Food it also outstanding and some of the best I have had in Montreal. I will say the food is really heavy and I don't want to think about the fat and calories. You'll probably walk out having eaten 2000 calories and well over 50 grams of fat, per person. Then again, if you really care about that stuff, subways right around the corner. Treat yourself, check it out. You will not be disappointed.We came to celebrate my husband's birthday. We reserved via email. It's the easiest way. I highly recommend reserving this way. I do not recommend going on Sunday's. They're out of everything. They were out of a few items. I didn't care for some, but being out of Ribs, Sweetbread, and BEER?! That was very disappointing. I ended up getting the famous Duck in a Can. Great flavour. Very delicious. Duck cooked to perfection. Then the Ragout. I liked the texture and how all the ingredients complimented each other, but it was wayyy too salty. I loved how it was prepared in a cheese block in front of us. Our waitress was rude and short with everything. Uninformative. We felt very rushed by her. Pretty much everything sucked but the Duck in a Can. I will come back and perhaps the experience will be better to tie with the good food.One of the best restaurants I have ever been to (if not the best).I had the duck in a can and my friend the risotto.The risotto is mixed in inside a large parmeggiano cheesw block and the duck is cooked inside the can for 27 minutes to a perfect taste.What an experienceService was great too!!Ouff getting a reservation at au PdeC was not an easy task ... who still operates over voicemail? Especially over a voicemail box that is always full?!But au PdeC still seems to get away with it thanks to all the hype Anthony Bourdain created during his 24 hour Montreal layover (if you've never watched it: dailymotion.com/.../xo2k…...).Needless to say, we had to try it out ourselves or we couldn't be called true Montrealers. But the overwhelming foie gras stuffed courses were too much for two people to handle, so we brought 2 friends for back up! All in all, if you come knowing that this will not be a fine dining experience and that you WILL be overindulging in rich and heavy courses, then your experience will be a satisfying one. And let's be honest, everything just tastes better with fat!From the foie gras stuffed croquettes that just ooze in your mouth as you bite into them, to the decadent poutine topped with foie gras gravy and a whole piece of foie gras and then the squash risotto cooked in a whole wheel of parmesan...! Your reward center will be firing away happy signals for hours to come smile emoticonAll this goodness, paired with a nice bottle of french wine (they have an extensive french heavy wine list and some good beer on tap) made this a highly enjoyable 'tourist in your own city experience'. Good food, good wine and great company along with a surprisingly affordable tab... what's not to like?Heard lots of great reviews for Au Pied de Cochon. This restaurant was featured on one of the shows by Anthony Bourdain! Service was excellent.DRINKS:Pied de Cochon beer x 2TERRAINE OF FOIE GRAS (4/5)Came with jam and bread. So delicious - it's pure foie gras. The taste is very strong and flavourful. A must for foie gras lovers :) I actually enjoyed this dish better without adding the jam on my slice of bread.FOIE GRAS POUTINE (5/5)A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! The closer you are to Montreal, the better the poutine gets and this one is a 5-star poutine for sure! Large slices of foie gras and big chunks of cheese.. mm fatty good!DUCK IN A CAN (5/5)So creative! It's a mini show when the waiter comes over and open the can in front of us (I recorded it all haha). The duck meat was tender and juicy - delicious. I would order this again the next time I visit Au Pied de Cochon.This place is the epitome of French Canadian cuisine. If you want an authentic Canadian culinary experience then this is not to be missed. The food is not for the faint of hearts and definitely leave your vegetarian friends at home. I wouldn't say this is a good everyday-go-to kinda restaurant so come here when you have visitors from out of town or for a special occasion. On to our meal. After cleansing our palettes with foie gras croquettes, we were ready for our main event. We bravely ordered the whole pig's head for two and I can say that it has been one of my most memorable meals. The head of pig was roasted to glistening perfection. Paired with apple and root veggies, the whole plate was full of flavour and tender juicy porky deliciousness. Since they have an open kitchen, people took pictures of our food as it made its way towards our table. It was quite the show! Have to admit I couldn't eat pork for a couple of weeks after but it was definitely worth every bite. Eating at Au Pied is a special event you don't want to miss.Do you love ducks? Or better yet, do you hate ducks? To the point where you'll eat ducks in every form for 3 different dishes? If so, Au Pied de Cochon is just what the doctor ordered.Sure, the name translates to the pig's feet, but the duck is where it's at.Foie gras poutine is about as rich and delicious as it sounds.The duck in a can (which COMES WITH FOIE GRAS) is also a must. Just watching the waiter take a can opener to it and drop it onto a plate is a thing of beauty. The entire can is boiled and then brought out. All the spices are infused and all the fattiness is preserved without getting boiled off. Super unique. Just don't overdo it. One can is probably enough for 3-4 people unless you REALLY want to feel unhealthy.We also got a side of duck fat fries, because WHY THE HELL NOT?There were 8 of us, so we did a few other entrees as well. One was the PDC's cut, which the waiter told us was a boneless pork chop (there was a bone). It looked dry, but it was actually incredibly moist. It was a gigantic hunk of meat too.We also did one of the specials - the Ahi tuna steak for two. Let me tell you, it was NOT for two. Maybe if you fasted and that was the only thing you ate that day. But it was also good. Perfectly rare, with a ton of veggies and cheese on the side. It was probably our least favorite of the dishes, but even still, it was very well done.We were seated all the way in the back by the wine cellar, so it was a bit of a tight squeeze (especially with another large group next to us), but there wasn't much else to complain about. They also have one hell of a wine list.Our waiter was super cool and gave us shots to round out the night.Probably one of the best meals I've ever had. Also, why I came back to the States with none of pants fitting anymore.Make reservations! Either call/email or reserve online. It's a must. Also come hungry, because, they serve a lot of food.This place gets super packed during the dinner rush. Even dining at the counter gets full.I'd recommend the foie gras duo to get the best out of APC. If you're dining with friends, then I'm sure you can taste each other's food. But for a single diner like myself, the foie gras duo comes with Foie Gras burger and foie gras poutine fries. Huge portions for about $50. Very fatty, very rich, and very good.I started off with the tuna tartare as an appetizer, but even though it is a small portion, I couldn't get through my foie gras duo because of the enormity of the portions. The tuna tartare was tarty and fresh.And I still wanted dessert after and I chose the toffee maple milk shake. They made it right in front me...I guess because I was in the counter, but you can see all the fatty goodness when they make this. Not to sweet, but I had enough room to finish it. I would order this again.Trying to find street parking might be hard for you during dinner time. And the metro station is several blocks away. You can probably try the bixi bikes if you have time to roam around this part of the Montreal neighborhood.Drip Drip Drip4 star for food and service but -0.5 star for all the water dripping from the vent on top of my head all through my dinner.Drip Drip Dip I know it was one of the hottest weekend in Montreal. It was end of July after all and I should be thankful for the nice cool interior of the restaurant with their AC on full blast. But with the water dripping on me the whole time (2 hour) while I was enjoying my dinner was not cool. The staff was all trying their best to stop the dripping from top of the AC vent which ran across the full depth of the restaurant by a squeegee sponge but it was not working....Drip Drip DripDinner was really good!! Excellent!We shared Tarragon Bison Tongue ($8.50) - I just love the Cornichon in that!

Drip Drip DripI would have up my star to a 4 because the food was just amazing and the service was excellent. But the management really need to do something about their cooling system.

Just a caveat. :-)We really wanted to try a Montreal special, as this place is very well known. This place has the famous foie gras poutine and Duck in a Can. We decided to all share to try a few more dishes. The baguette is good!The ambience is nice. We went right when it opened and there was a small line waiting. You cannot get seated if you have not made a reservation. Plan ahead. 1. Garden salad: not on the menu, but we figured we were having so many animal parts this was probably a good idea. $15 for generic salad. The salad was fresh but basic. 2. Mushroom risotto: this dish is very expensive for what it is, but you get a show. They come to your table with a large cheese bowl and add the risotto, mushroom, and even Canadian bacon. This dish had potential but was much too salty. It was hard to finish. 3. Terragon Bison tongue: this is tongue well done. The texture is very soft, which is impressive given the quality of most tongues. The sauces and everything just work well together. However, it's game-y so just be warned. 4. Foie gras poutine: loved it. The fries were good. The gravy was also good. The foie gras was in large blocks and was nice and fatty. I think if you come here, you should get this dish! 5. Duck in a Can: I loved watching them pour half a duck out of a can. Life experience. It even looked nice coming out. The duck came out as a thick filet attached to a flap of lard and also fatty liver (foie gras). I enjoyed this dish very much. It was over puréed cauliflower. The issue I had was that the duck meat was very thick. I had to eat it with slices of the lard to complement the taste. Overall a good dish. 6. Dessert: we got the maple cake and the lemon pie. Both were pretty good. Get the maple cake for novelty sake! Very sweet but good flavors. It was a pricy meal, but for a specialty restaurant it made sense.When my friend and I were certain we wanted to try Au Pied de Cochon, I tried to make reservation (1 week in advance) but their voicemail box was full... I didn't know what to do except, trying to call in the following days... And finally, 2 days before the date we wanted to go, I was finally able to make a reservation (but there weren't any tables left, and the lady asked me if it was okay to be seated at the counter/bar, which I was fine with).Being seated at the counter/bar was actually one exciting experience since we were able to watch the chefs cook and take a glance at all the dishes other customers ordered! It was really mind-blowing watching them cook in a fast-moving environment! I really liked their open-kitchen. It was also fun to guess whether the dish was ours or not too (it was our first time at Au Pied de Cochon, so we didn't know what to expect!)Before coming to Au Pied de Cochon, I searched other people's reviews and made my mind that I wanted to try their Duck in a Can! And this was one of the two dishes we ordered. We didn't know what to order next and my friend thought the The PDC Melting Pot has an interesting name, so we ordered that! Our waiter served us bread and butter (we didn't eat a lot since we wanted to save the tummy for our main courses, but the bread was not too hard, it was perfect!)Duck in a Can: Ordered it like I said because a lot of reviews said it is a must there! It is without doubt an interesting and fun dish. It came in a heated can (like how the name of the dish suggested). So, the waiter brought it over and opened it in front of you, poured the content out of the can (which contains the duck breast, 100g of foie gras, cabbages, the sauce) over the bread with carrot and cauliflower purée. The meat was really tender and it went very well with the cabbage, especially when you eat it with a small piece of duck meat. I actually really like the cabbage! It balanced the richness of the duck meat and foie gras very well. The fat under the duck meat was so chewy (I like chewy stuff) but the other fat part was.... I didn't like it since it was too greasy but some people like the feeling of fat melting in the mouth. We finished the dish (expect for the fat part) since it was too much for us.Duck in a can was quite an experience to be honest, it might not be my favorite dish due to its richness and especially oiliness but it was definitely an unique and interesting experience due to the presentation of the dish in a can!PDC Melting Pot:We actually preferred the melting pot because the taste wasn't as heavy as Duck in a Can and the pot was full of surprises, which made it more interesting. This dish came in a pot which was already hinted with its name! There was pork sausages, shiitake mushrooms, buttery potato cheese which was like mashed potatoes with cheese at the bottom, blood sausage -boudin but it is not like the Asian style one-, pork belly (so yummy!), pork loin and onions. There were a lot of things inside the pot; a lots of surprises! I absolutely loved the "buttery potato cheese", it was so delicious and well-made! The pork was tender and everything in this pot went extremely well with the mashed potatoes! The onion sauce was perfect too! It was a rich dish but not overwhelming like Duck in a Can.We also ordered their Milkshake XXX. My thought of my first sip: this is quite sweet... But afterwards, it got better! I don't know what was inside this milkshake... It tasted like rum (I'm not sure if it contained alcohol though). This was one rich milkshake I would say!We were basically in a food coma after this! I would definitely like to come back again and try their bison tongue (saw good reviews about it!)P.S: Make sure to make a reservation!!! Keep on trying even when their voicemail box is full!Service is outstanding. The employees are so attentive and seem to really love their jobs. Food it also outstanding and some of the best I have had in Montreal. I will say the food is really heavy and I don't want to think about the fat and calories. You'll probably walk out having eaten 2000 calories and well over 50 grams of fat, per person. Then again, if you really care about that stuff, subways right around the corner. Treat yourself, check it out. You will not be disappointed.We came to celebrate my husband's birthday. We reserved via email. It's the easiest way. I highly recommend reserving this way. I do not recommend going on Sunday's. They're out of everything. They were out of a few items. I didn't care for some, but being out of Ribs, Sweetbread, and BEER?! That was very disappointing. I ended up getting the famous Duck in a Can. Great flavour. Very delicious. Duck cooked to perfection. Then the Ragout. I liked the texture and how all the ingredients complimented each other, but it was wayyy too salty. I loved how it was prepared in a cheese block in front of us. Our waitress was rude and short with everything. Uninformative. We felt very rushed by her. Pretty much everything sucked but the Duck in a Can. I will come back and perhaps the experience will be better to tie with the good food.One of the best restaurants I have ever been to (if not the best).I had the duck in a can and my friend the risotto.The risotto is mixed in inside a large parmeggiano cheesw block and the duck is cooked inside the can for 27 minutes to a perfect taste.What an experienceService was great too!!Ouff getting a reservation at au PdeC was not an easy task ... who still operates over voicemail? Especially over a voicemail box that is always full?!But au PdeC still seems to get away with it thanks to all the hype Anthony Bourdain created during his 24 hour Montreal layover (if you've never watched it: dailymotion.com/.../xo2k…...).Needless to say, we had to try it out ourselves or we couldn't be called true Montrealers. But the overwhelming foie gras stuffed courses were too much for two people to handle, so we brought 2 friends for back up! All in all, if you come knowing that this will not be a fine dining experience and that you WILL be overindulging in rich and heavy courses, then your experience will be a satisfying one. And let's be honest, everything just tastes better with fat!From the foie gras stuffed croquettes that just ooze in your mouth as you bite into them, to the decadent poutine topped with foie gras gravy and a whole piece of foie gras and then the squash risotto cooked in a whole wheel of parmesan...! Your reward center will be firing away happy signals for hours to come smile emoticonAll this goodness, paired with a nice bottle of french wine (they have an extensive french heavy wine list and some good beer on tap) made this a highly enjoyable 'tourist in your own city experience'. Good food, good wine and great company along with a surprisingly affordable tab... what's not to like?Heard lots of great reviews for Au Pied de Cochon. This restaurant was featured on one of the shows by Anthony Bourdain! Service was excellent.DRINKS:Pied de Cochon beer x 2TERRAINE OF FOIE GRAS (4/5)Came with jam and bread. So delicious - it's pure foie gras. The taste is very strong and flavourful. A must for foie gras lovers :) I actually enjoyed this dish better without adding the jam on my slice of bread.FOIE GRAS POUTINE (5/5)A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! The closer you are to Montreal, the better the poutine gets and this one is a 5-star poutine for sure! Large slices of foie gras and big chunks of cheese.. mm fatty good!DUCK IN A CAN (5/5)So creative! It's a mini show when the waiter comes over and open the can in front of us (I recorded it all haha). The duck meat was tender and juicy - delicious. I would order this again the next time I visit Au Pied de Cochon.This place is the epitome of French Canadian cuisine. If you want an authentic Canadian culinary experience then this is not to be missed. The food is not for the faint of hearts and definitely leave your vegetarian friends at home. I wouldn't say this is a good everyday-go-to kinda restaurant so come here when you have visitors from out of town or for a special occasion. On to our meal. After cleansing our palettes with foie gras croquettes, we were ready for our main event. We bravely ordered the whole pig's head for two and I can say that it has been one of my most memorable meals. The head of pig was roasted to glistening perfection. Paired with apple and root veggies, the whole plate was full of flavour and tender juicy porky deliciousness. Since they have an open kitchen, people took pictures of our food as it made its way towards our table. It was quite the show! Have to admit I couldn't eat pork for a couple of weeks after but it was definitely worth every bite. Eating at Au Pied is a special event you don't want to miss.Do you love ducks? Or better yet, do you hate ducks? To the point where you'll eat ducks in every form for 3 different dishes? If so, Au Pied de Cochon is just what the doctor ordered.Sure, the name translates to the pig's feet, but the duck is where it's at.Foie gras poutine is about as rich and delicious as it sounds.The duck in a can (which COMES WITH FOIE GRAS) is also a must. Just watching the waiter take a can opener to it and drop it onto a plate is a thing of beauty. The entire can is boiled and then brought out. All the spices are infused and all the fattiness is preserved without getting boiled off. Super unique. Just don't overdo it. One can is probably enough for 3-4 people unless you REALLY want to feel unhealthy.We also got a side of duck fat fries, because WHY THE HELL NOT?There were 8 of us, so we did a few other entrees as well. One was the PDC's cut, which the waiter told us was a boneless pork chop (there was a bone). It looked dry, but it was actually incredibly moist. It was a gigantic hunk of meat too.We also did one of the specials - the Ahi tuna steak for two. Let me tell you, it was NOT for two. Maybe if you fasted and that was the only thing you ate that day. But it was also good. Perfectly rare, with a ton of veggies and cheese on the side. It was probably our least favorite of the dishes, but even still, it was very well done.We were seated all the way in the back by the wine cellar, so it was a bit of a tight squeeze (especially with another large group next to us), but there wasn't much else to complain about. They also have one hell of a wine list.Our waiter was super cool and gave us shots to round out the night.Probably one of the best meals I've ever had. Also, why I came back to the States with none of pants fitting anymore.Make reservations! Either call/email or reserve online. It's a must. Also come hungry, because, they serve a lot of food.This place gets super packed during the dinner rush. Even dining at the counter gets full.I'd recommend the foie gras duo to get the best out of APC. If you're dining with friends, then I'm sure you can taste each other's food. But for a single diner like myself, the foie gras duo comes with Foie Gras burger and foie gras poutine fries. Huge portions for about $50. Very fatty, very rich, and very good.I started off with the tuna tartare as an appetizer, but even though it is a small portion, I couldn't get through my foie gras duo because of the enormity of the portions. The tuna tartare was tarty and fresh.And I still wanted dessert after and I chose the toffee maple milk shake. They made it right in front me...I guess because I was in the counter, but you can see all the fatty goodness when they make this. Not to sweet, but I had enough room to finish it. I would order this again.Trying to find street parking might be hard for you during dinner time. And the metro station is several blocks away. You can probably try the bixi bikes if you have time to roam around this part of the Montreal neighborhood.Drip Drip Drip4 star for food and service but -0.5 star for all the water dripping from the vent on top of my head all through my dinner.Drip Drip Dip I know it was one of the hottest weekend in Montreal. It was end of July after all and I should be thankful for the nice cool interior of the restaurant with their AC on full blast. But with the water dripping on me the whole time (2 hour) while I was enjoying my dinner was not cool. The staff was all trying their best to stop the dripping from top of the AC vent which ran across the full depth of the restaurant by a squeegee sponge but it was not working....Drip Drip DripDinner was really good!! Excellent!We shared Tarragon Bison Tongue ($8.50) - I just love the Cornichon in that! And now I have a bottle in my fridge at home!Pâté de Campagne ($9) - So smooth and rich!Duck Carpaccio ($14) - Well seasoned, my first time having duck carpaccioDuck in a Can ($44) - So overhyped! The duck was dry and just not good! Foie Gras was so so. I don't believe I said that but I preferred mine seared...Braised Pig Feet with Side Pasta ($50) Seasonal - Must Order!! It was so tender and flavoured!! And the pasta which was prepared table side was so good! Perfect al dente and with BACON... Drip Drip DripI would have up my star to a 4 because the food was just amazing and the service was excellent. But the management really need to do something about their cooling system. I definitely would be back! PS The reservation system just got so much better as my reservation was confirmed by email and no need to play phone tag again!We had the foie gras poutine, stuffed pied de cochon with foie gras and a tuna dish. All were very rich in flavor and will lead to a heart attack BUT worth every bite. Poutine- get it! after all it is a Canadian dishStuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras- this is large enough for 3-4 people to share, the best part about this dish was the MASHED POTATO, it is sooooooooo good! it has a different texture from the typical mushy mashed potato. Tuna dish- our waiter picked this for us so I don't know what it's called but it's a pretty good dish with gravy and mashed potato on the bottom but it was a little salty though. Overall, amazing FATTY French Canadian food.Very rich food. If you like your food too creamy or too buttery, then this is your type of food. Everything was just very heavy and I couldn't seem to finish the dish. The FG is actually not bad as this was my first time tasting it. Definitely not something I would typically eat but at least I tried it! Plogue Champlain $29Pork filet $30Fg hamburger $39Squash risotto $24Fg poutine $24Eel tart $14The place was jam packed and there's absolutely no room to move if you're sitting on the outside of the table. Service is slow because of how busy it is. Might take you 10min to get the attention of a waitress and another 10 for the bill. Overall definitely a place to try but not something I would do again as its not really my type of food fare.I am judging overall as a meal and the service. First off, the place doesnt have a banner so it is difficult to spot if you dont know where it is. Foie gras poutine. Very good, the foie gras melted in with the poutine and you were able to taste the foie gras. The texture or the plate was consistant, there was cheesy, crispy and then the foie gras made it very good. you were able to taste that the fries were fried in the duck fat and the gravy was creamy and rich. with that being said, a very good dish but will get heavy and sickening after you eat too much of it.Foie gras a la champlain. foie gras on top of a thick slice of bacon, on a bed of thin crispy potato pancake (like a thin hashbrown), topped with a generous amount of maple syrup sauce. First bite was veryyyyy good!! So cripsy from the potato, the bacon was thick and the foie gras was enhanced in this plate, the maple syrup sauce was a good amount of sweet and salty. But this is definitely not a plate you eat on your own, its best for sharing because after a while the taste and maple syrup is quite overwhelming. table side Squash risotto. risotto was cooked very well but since it was table side she made it in the a large parmesan cheese, mixed it all together. She over poured the chicken broth and the risotto became a soup. The waiter asked how it was and I told him honestly that I did not like it because it was too watery. He left then about 3-4 mins later he asked me "do you want me to take it to the chef to try it", well no obviously not! She should have known when she served it because it was clearly too watery. He knew I was unhappy and he was the one that was pushing for this squash risotto, he didnt do anything to make up for the bad dish. At a resto like that I would expect so much more. Overall, theres definitely better. I'm glad I tried it but I would not be returning.We made the reservation two weeks ago. Probably because it's weekday, we are the only customers at 5:00pm.We didn't drink alcohol, only a bottle of water. The water is in glass bottle, taste better than thesame brand in plastic bottle.Tarragon Bison Tongue is the first dish. The tongue is from beef. Mr. Tang said it's good. I prefer the pickle, since I didn't try the tongue.Catch of the day, we picked the smoked eel. It also served with a piece of veal bone, you can eat the marrow(not sure if it's this word...).Fg poutine is great, although foie gras is too greasy for me.The duck in a can is great too. The duck is juicy and fresh, also with blood. The veggie taste a bit sour, really savory.The one missing star is for the dessert. Both icecream and pecan pie are too sweet for me to enjoy.After much hype, I made it here with a few colleagues on a Wednesday evening. The place was absolutely hopping and hard to get into, but we made a reservation a few weeks in advance.Once inside we sat at the bar, which is by far the best seat in the house. It comes with a direct view of the kitchen and all the goodness the chefs are whipping up. We started out with the ham special for appetizer, which was delicious. It came with a baguette and butter which made it perfect. We then had some poutine, which was also quite good. It was definitely better quality than most poutine dishes. For the main course, I went aggressive and got a mixed bowl consisting of blood sausage, pork sausage, mushrooms and onions sitting on top of mashed potatoes. The dish was very good, but not the amazing experience I was hoping for. Spices could have been a little better, but make no mistake it was a very good dish.With its popular reputation, upbeat atmosphere and good food, this is definitely a place worth visiting when in town. They also have a really good bar with interesting drinks. Great overall experience.Delicious food and a must if you're in Montreal. Come in hungry bc you'll get a rich and hearty meal. We ordered the infamous duck in a can, mushroom tortellini (tonites special), the steamed dumplings & plogue a Champlain "foie gras breakfast" - which was the highlight of the night. buckwheat pancake,  thick Canadian bacon, potatoes and cheese topped with foie gras. I wish it was one of the earlier items delivered I would have enjoyed a few more bites. Would def come here with a group to be able to taste more items on the menu. It's a busy restaurant so do make reservations. We scored 9:30 pm reservations on a Sunday night and place was packed with ppl still coming in with reservations after us. Service was slow and we had a really long wait b/t entrees coming out. We didn't leave until after 11:30. Luckily for us, our toddler was still on California time and was cooperative.Visit Montreal for a weekend and made a reservation two weeks in advance. Not too hard: I left a voicemail and someone called me back the next day. Between my friend and I, we ordered:- cromesquis de foie gras, basically deep fried fg. For $4, it was worth it. - temaki tartare, tartare Japanese hand roll. They didn't have bison available and we were offered veal. I quite enjoyed the layers of flavour and texture. - carpaccio de canard, duck carpaccio. My second favorite of the night. - and finally, poutine au foie gras. I hate to say it but this was a bit of a disappointment. I'm a fan of fg but this didn't have the ah-ha for me. We went later in the evening and 2 of the 3 cocktails were already sold out. My reco would be to go early. We also had a lot of trouble finding this place late at night. You really have to know what the front looks like!If you love pork and foie gras, this place is heaven. Recommend getting the foie gras poutine and the duck in a can. We also ordered the onion soup, duck carpaccio and the dumplings.Onion soup - your standard cheesy onion soup done right. Super tasty. Foie gras Poutine - must get!! Abundance of extra buttery and fatty foie gras with fries and gravy. This is a heavy dish so great for sharing and having a cold beer. Duck carpaccio - the presentation of the dish was beautiful. Thinly slice duck with chives, raw mushrooms and a yolk. Duck in a can - must get as well! The waiter brings over the can and opens it in front of the table. The content of the can contains the small duck, foie gras, cabbage which is all poured over the bread with carrot purée. The meat was tender and succulent.The service was very good - our waiter was extremely nice and helpful in making suggestions. There are so many options to choose from so it's great if you come with a big group and share everything!This place is insanely delicious.  The restaurant is a bit tight on space but the kitchen is opened. You can actually hear the staff call out orders.  There are so many options that we probably over ordered for two people!! For starters, we had poutine with foie gras, duck carpaccio and beef tongue.  For entrees we had the duck in a can and the blood sausage tart.  The duck in the can was amazing! We totally over did it on the foie gras but you only live once! We had so much foodWe had to call ahead so the restaurant could accommodate our baby.I went with a southern French person to this restaurant but he did not completely agree with my assessment.

I would order this again the next time I visit Au Pied de Cochon.This place is the epitome of French Canadian cuisine. If you want an authentic Canadian culinary experience then this is not to be missed. The food is not for the faint of hearts and definitely leave your vegetarian friends at home. I wouldn't say this is a good everyday-go-to kinda restaurant so come here when you have visitors from out of town or for a special occasion. On to our meal. After cleansing our palettes with foie gras croquettes, we were ready for our main event. We bravely ordered the whole pig's head for two and I can say that it has been one of my most memorable meals. The head of pig was roasted to glistening perfection. Paired with apple and root veggies, the whole plate was full of flavour and tender juicy porky deliciousness. Since they have an open kitchen, people took pictures of our food as it made its way towards our table. It was quite the show! Have to admit I couldn't eat pork for a couple of weeks after but it was definitely worth every bite. Eating at Au Pied is a special event you don't want to miss.Do you love ducks? Or better yet, do you hate ducks? To the point where you'll eat ducks in every form for 3 different dishes? If so, Au Pied de Cochon is just what the doctor ordered.Sure, the name translates to the pig's feet, but the duck is where it's at.Foie gras poutine is about as rich and delicious as it sounds.The duck in a can (which COMES WITH FOIE GRAS) is also a must. Just watching the waiter take a can opener to it and drop it onto a plate is a thing of beauty. The entire can is boiled and then brought out. All the spices are infused and all the fattiness is preserved without getting boiled off. Super unique. Just don't overdo it. One can is probably enough for 3-4 people unless you REALLY want to feel unhealthy.We also got a side of duck fat fries, because WHY THE HELL NOT?There were 8 of us, so we did a few other entrees as well. One was the PDC's cut, which the waiter told us was a boneless pork chop (there was a bone). It looked dry, but it was actually incredibly moist. It was a gigantic hunk of meat too.We also did one of the specials - the Ahi tuna steak for two. Let me tell you, it was NOT for two. Maybe if you fasted and that was the only thing you ate that day. But it was also good. Perfectly rare, with a ton of veggies and cheese on the side. It was probably our least favorite of the dishes, but even still, it was very well done.We were seated all the way in the back by the wine cellar, so it was a bit of a tight squeeze (especially with another large group next to us), but there wasn't much else to complain about. They also have one hell of a wine list.Our waiter was super cool and gave us shots to round out the night.Probably one of the best meals I've ever had. Also, why I came back to the States with none of pants fitting anymore.Make reservations! Either call/email or reserve online. It's a must. Also come hungry, because, they serve a lot of food.This place gets super packed during the dinner rush. Even dining at the counter gets full.I'd recommend the foie gras duo to get the best out of APC. If you're dining with friends, then I'm sure you can taste each other's food. But for a single diner like myself, the foie gras duo comes with Foie Gras burger and foie gras poutine fries. Huge portions for about $50. Very fatty, very rich, and very good.I started off with the tuna tartare as an appetizer, but even though it is a small portion, I couldn't get through my foie gras duo because of the enormity of the portions. The tuna tartare was tarty and fresh.And I still wanted dessert after and I chose the toffee maple milk shake. They made it right in front me...I guess because I was in the counter, but you can see all the fatty goodness when they make this. Not to sweet, but I had enough room to finish it. I would order this again.Trying to find street parking might be hard for you during dinner time. And the metro station is several blocks away. You can probably try the bixi bikes if you have time to roam around this part of the Montreal neighborhood.Drip Drip Drip4 star for food and service but -0.5 star for all the water dripping from the vent on top of my head all through my dinner.Drip Drip Dip I know it was one of the hottest weekend in Montreal. It was end of July after all and I should be thankful for the nice cool interior of the restaurant with their AC on full blast. But with the water dripping on me the whole time (2 hour) while I was enjoying my dinner was not cool. The staff was all trying their best to stop the dripping from top of the AC vent which ran across the full depth of the restaurant by a squeegee sponge but it was not working....Drip Drip DripDinner was really good!! Excellent!We shared Tarragon Bison Tongue ($8.50) - I just love the Cornichon in that! And now I have a bottle in my fridge at home!Pâté de Campagne ($9) - So smooth and rich!Duck Carpaccio ($14) - Well seasoned, my first time having duck carpaccioDuck in a Can ($44) - So overhyped! The duck was dry and just not good! Foie Gras was so so. I don't believe I said that but I preferred mine seared...Braised Pig Feet with Side Pasta ($50) Seasonal - Must Order!! It was so tender and flavoured!! And the pasta which was prepared table side was so good! Perfect al dente and with BACON... Drip Drip DripI would have up my star to a 4 because the food was just amazing and the service was excellent. But the management really need to do something about their cooling system. I definitely would be back! PS The reservation system just got so much better as my reservation was confirmed by email and no need to play phone tag again!We had the foie gras poutine, stuffed pied de cochon with foie gras and a tuna dish. All were very rich in flavor and will lead to a heart attack BUT worth every bite. Poutine- get it! after all it is a Canadian dishStuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras- this is large enough for 3-4 people to share, the best part about this dish was the MASHED POTATO, it is sooooooooo good! it has a different texture from the typical mushy mashed potato. Tuna dish- our waiter picked this for us so I don't know what it's called but it's a pretty good dish with gravy and mashed potato on the bottom but it was a little salty though. Overall, amazing FATTY French Canadian food.Very rich food. If you like your food too creamy or too buttery, then this is your type of food. Everything was just very heavy and I couldn't seem to finish the dish. The FG is actually not bad as this was my first time tasting it. Definitely not something I would typically eat but at least I tried it! Plogue Champlain $29Pork filet $30Fg hamburger $39Squash risotto $24Fg poutine $24Eel tart $14The place was jam packed and there's absolutely no room to move if you're sitting on the outside of the table. Service is slow because of how busy it is. Might take you 10min to get the attention of a waitress and another 10 for the bill. Overall definitely a place to try but not something I would do again as its not really my type of food fare.I am judging overall as a meal and the service. First off, the place doesnt have a banner so it is difficult to spot if you dont know where it is. Foie gras poutine. Very good, the foie gras melted in with the poutine and you were able to taste the foie gras. The texture or the plate was consistant, there was cheesy, crispy and then the foie gras made it very good. you were able to taste that the fries were fried in the duck fat and the gravy was creamy and rich. with that being said, a very good dish but will get heavy and sickening after you eat too much of it.Foie gras a la champlain. foie gras on top of a thick slice of bacon, on a bed of thin crispy potato pancake (like a thin hashbrown), topped with a generous amount of maple syrup sauce. First bite was veryyyyy good!! So cripsy from the potato, the bacon was thick and the foie gras was enhanced in this plate, the maple syrup sauce was a good amount of sweet and salty. But this is definitely not a plate you eat on your own, its best for sharing because after a while the taste and maple syrup is quite overwhelming. table side Squash risotto. risotto was cooked very well but since it was table side she made it in the a large parmesan cheese, mixed it all together. She over poured the chicken broth and the risotto became a soup. The waiter asked how it was and I told him honestly that I did not like it because it was too watery. He left then about 3-4 mins later he asked me "do you want me to take it to the chef to try it", well no obviously not! She should have known when she served it because it was clearly too watery. He knew I was unhappy and he was the one that was pushing for this squash risotto, he didnt do anything to make up for the bad dish. At a resto like that I would expect so much more. Overall, theres definitely better. I'm glad I tried it but I would not be returning.We made the reservation two weeks ago. Probably because it's weekday, we are the only customers at 5:00pm.We didn't drink alcohol, only a bottle of water. The water is in glass bottle, taste better than thesame brand in plastic bottle.Tarragon Bison Tongue is the first dish. The tongue is from beef. Mr. Tang said it's good. I prefer the pickle, since I didn't try the tongue.Catch of the day, we picked the smoked eel. It also served with a piece of veal bone, you can eat the marrow(not sure if it's this word...).Fg poutine is great, although foie gras is too greasy for me.The duck in a can is great too. The duck is juicy and fresh, also with blood. The veggie taste a bit sour, really savory.The one missing star is for the dessert. Both icecream and pecan pie are too sweet for me to enjoy.After much hype, I made it here with a few colleagues on a Wednesday evening. The place was absolutely hopping and hard to get into, but we made a reservation a few weeks in advance.Once inside we sat at the bar, which is by far the best seat in the house. It comes with a direct view of the kitchen and all the goodness the chefs are whipping up. We started out with the ham special for appetizer, which was delicious. It came with a baguette and butter which made it perfect. We then had some poutine, which was also quite good. It was definitely better quality than most poutine dishes. For the main course, I went aggressive and got a mixed bowl consisting of blood sausage, pork sausage, mushrooms and onions sitting on top of mashed potatoes. The dish was very good, but not the amazing experience I was hoping for. Spices could have been a little better, but make no mistake it was a very good dish.With its popular reputation, upbeat atmosphere and good food, this is definitely a place worth visiting when in town. They also have a really good bar with interesting drinks. Great overall experience.Delicious food and a must if you're in Montreal. Come in hungry bc you'll get a rich and hearty meal. We ordered the infamous duck in a can, mushroom tortellini (tonites special), the steamed dumplings & plogue a Champlain "foie gras breakfast" - which was the highlight of the night. buckwheat pancake,  thick Canadian bacon, potatoes and cheese topped with foie gras. I wish it was one of the earlier items delivered I would have enjoyed a few more bites. Would def come here with a group to be able to taste more items on the menu. It's a busy restaurant so do make reservations. We scored 9:30 pm reservations on a Sunday night and place was packed with ppl still coming in with reservations after us. Service was slow and we had a really long wait b/t entrees coming out. We didn't leave until after 11:30. Luckily for us, our toddler was still on California time and was cooperative.Visit Montreal for a weekend and made a reservation two weeks in advance. Not too hard: I left a voicemail and someone called me back the next day. Between my friend and I, we ordered:- cromesquis de foie gras, basically deep fried fg. For $4, it was worth it. - temaki tartare, tartare Japanese hand roll. They didn't have bison available and we were offered veal. I quite enjoyed the layers of flavour and texture. - carpaccio de canard, duck carpaccio. My second favorite of the night. - and finally, poutine au foie gras. I hate to say it but this was a bit of a disappointment. I'm a fan of fg but this didn't have the ah-ha for me. We went later in the evening and 2 of the 3 cocktails were already sold out. My reco would be to go early. We also had a lot of trouble finding this place late at night. You really have to know what the front looks like!If you love pork and foie gras, this place is heaven. Recommend getting the foie gras poutine and the duck in a can. We also ordered the onion soup, duck carpaccio and the dumplings.Onion soup - your standard cheesy onion soup done right. Super tasty. Foie gras Poutine - must get!! Abundance of extra buttery and fatty foie gras with fries and gravy. This is a heavy dish so great for sharing and having a cold beer. Duck carpaccio - the presentation of the dish was beautiful. Thinly slice duck with chives, raw mushrooms and a yolk. Duck in a can - must get as well! The waiter brings over the can and opens it in front of the table. The content of the can contains the small duck, foie gras, cabbage which is all poured over the bread with carrot purée. The meat was tender and succulent.The service was very good - our waiter was extremely nice and helpful in making suggestions. There are so many options to choose from so it's great if you come with a big group and share everything!This place is insanely delicious.  The restaurant is a bit tight on space but the kitchen is opened. You can actually hear the staff call out orders.  There are so many options that we probably over ordered for two people!! For starters, we had poutine with foie gras, duck carpaccio and beef tongue.  For entrees we had the duck in a can and the blood sausage tart.  The duck in the can was amazing! We totally over did it on the foie gras but you only live once! We had so much foodWe had to call ahead so the restaurant could accommodate our baby.I went with a southern French person to this restaurant but he did not completely agree with my assessment. Just a caveat. :-)We really wanted to try a Montreal special, as this place is very well known. This place has the famous foie gras poutine and Duck in a Can. We decided to all share to try a few more dishes. The baguette is good!The ambience is nice. We went right when it opened and there was a small line waiting. You cannot get seated if you have not made a reservation. Plan ahead. 1. Garden salad: not on the menu, but we figured we were having so many animal parts this was probably a good idea. $15 for generic salad. The salad was fresh but basic. 2. Mushroom risotto: this dish is very expensive for what it is, but you get a show. They come to your table with a large cheese bowl and add the risotto, mushroom, and even Canadian bacon. This dish had potential but was much too salty. It was hard to finish. 3. Terragon Bison tongue: this is tongue well done. The texture is very soft, which is impressive given the quality of most tongues. The sauces and everything just work well together. However, it's game-y so just be warned. 4. Foie gras poutine: loved it. The fries were good. The gravy was also good. The foie gras was in large blocks and was nice and fatty. I think if you come here, you should get this dish! 5. Duck in a Can: I loved watching them pour half a duck out of a can. Life experience. It even looked nice coming out. The duck came out as a thick filet attached to a flap of lard and also fatty liver (foie gras). I enjoyed this dish very much. It was over puréed cauliflower. The issue I had was that the duck meat was very thick. I had to eat it with slices of the lard to complement the taste. Overall a good dish. 6. Dessert: we got the maple cake and the lemon pie. Both were pretty good. Get the maple cake for novelty sake! Very sweet but good flavors. It was a pricy meal, but for a specialty restaurant it made sense.When my friend and I were certain we wanted to try Au Pied de Cochon, I tried to make reservation (1 week in advance) but their voicemail box was full... I didn't know what to do except, trying to call in the following days... And finally, 2 days before the date we wanted to go, I was finally able to make a reservation (but there weren't any tables left, and the lady asked me if it was okay to be seated at the counter/bar, which I was fine with).Being seated at the counter/bar was actually one exciting experience since we were able to watch the chefs cook and take a glance at all the dishes other customers ordered! It was really mind-blowing watching them cook in a fast-moving environment! I really liked their open-kitchen. It was also fun to guess whether the dish was ours or not too (it was our first time at Au Pied de Cochon, so we didn't know what to expect!)Before coming to Au Pied de Cochon, I searched other people's reviews and made my mind that I wanted to try their Duck in a Can! And this was one of the two dishes we ordered. We didn't know what to order next and my friend thought the The PDC Melting Pot has an interesting name, so we ordered that! Our waiter served us bread and butter (we didn't eat a lot since we wanted to save the tummy for our main courses, but the bread was not too hard, it was perfect!)Duck in a Can: Ordered it like I said because a lot of reviews said it is a must there! It is without doubt an interesting and fun dish. It came in a heated can (like how the name of the dish suggested). So, the waiter brought it over and opened it in front of you, poured the content out of the can (which contains the duck breast, 100g of foie gras, cabbages, the sauce) over the bread with carrot and cauliflower purée. The meat was really tender and it went very well with the cabbage, especially when you eat it with a small piece of duck meat. I actually really like the cabbage! It balanced the richness of the duck meat and foie gras very well. The fat under the duck meat was so chewy (I like chewy stuff) but the other fat part was.... I didn't like it since it was too greasy but some people like the feeling of fat melting in the mouth. We finished the dish (expect for the fat part) since it was too much for us.Duck in a can was quite an experience to be honest, it might not be my favorite dish due to its richness and especially oiliness but it was definitely an unique and interesting experience due to the presentation of the dish in a can!PDC Melting Pot:We actually preferred the melting pot because the taste wasn't as heavy as Duck in a Can and the pot was full of surprises, which made it more interesting. This dish came in a pot which was already hinted with its name! There was pork sausages, shiitake mushrooms, buttery potato cheese which was like mashed potatoes with cheese at the bottom, blood sausage -boudin but it is not like the Asian style one-, pork belly (so yummy!), pork loin and onions. There were a lot of things inside the pot; a lots of surprises! I absolutely loved the "buttery potato cheese", it was so delicious and well-made! The pork was tender and everything in this pot went extremely well with the mashed potatoes! The onion sauce was perfect too! It was a rich dish but not overwhelming like Duck in a Can.We also ordered their Milkshake XXX. My thought of my first sip: this is quite sweet... But afterwards, it got better! I don't know what was inside this milkshake... It tasted like rum (I'm not sure if it contained alcohol though). This was one rich milkshake I would say!We were basically in a food coma after this! I would definitely like to come back again and try their bison tongue (saw good reviews about it!)P.S: Make sure to make a reservation!!! Keep on trying even when their voicemail box is full!Service is outstanding. The employees are so attentive and seem to really love their jobs. Food it also outstanding and some of the best I have had in Montreal. I will say the food is really heavy and I don't want to think about the fat and calories. You'll probably walk out having eaten 2000 calories and well over 50 grams of fat, per person. Then again, if you really care about that stuff, subways right around the corner. Treat yourself, check it out. You will not be disappointed.We came to celebrate my husband's birthday. We reserved via email. It's the easiest way. I highly recommend reserving this way. I do not recommend going on Sunday's. They're out of everything. They were out of a few items. I didn't care for some, but being out of Ribs, Sweetbread, and BEER?! That was very disappointing. I ended up getting the famous Duck in a Can. Great flavour. Very delicious. Duck cooked to perfection. Then the Ragout. I liked the texture and how all the ingredients complimented each other, but it was wayyy too salty. I loved how it was prepared in a cheese block in front of us. Our waitress was rude and short with everything. Uninformative. We felt very rushed by her. Pretty much everything sucked but the Duck in a Can. I will come back and perhaps the experience will be better to tie with the good food.One of the best restaurants I have ever been to (if not the best).I had the duck in a can and my friend the risotto.The risotto is mixed in inside a large parmeggiano cheesw block and the duck is cooked inside the can for 27 minutes to a perfect taste.What an experienceService was great too!!Ouff getting a reservation at au PdeC was not an easy task ... who still operates over voicemail? Especially over a voicemail box that is always full?!But au PdeC still seems to get away with it thanks to all the hype Anthony Bourdain created during his 24 hour Montreal layover (if you've never watched it: dailymotion.com/.../xo2k…...).Needless to say, we had to try it out ourselves or we couldn't be called true Montrealers. But the overwhelming foie gras stuffed courses were too much for two people to handle, so we brought 2 friends for back up! All in all, if you come knowing that this will not be a fine dining experience and that you WILL be overindulging in rich and heavy courses, then your experience will be a satisfying one. And let's be honest, everything just tastes better with fat!From the foie gras stuffed croquettes that just ooze in your mouth as you bite into them, to the decadent poutine topped with foie gras gravy and a whole piece of foie gras and then the squash risotto cooked in a whole wheel of parmesan...! Your reward center will be firing away happy signals for hours to come smile emoticonAll this goodness, paired with a nice bottle of french wine (they have an extensive french heavy wine list and some good beer on tap) made this a highly enjoyable 'tourist in your own city experience'. Good food, good wine and great company along with a surprisingly affordable tab... what's not to like?Heard lots of great reviews for Au Pied de Cochon. This restaurant was featured on one of the shows by Anthony Bourdain! Service was excellent.DRINKS:Pied de Cochon beer x 2TERRAINE OF FOIE GRAS (4/5)Came with jam and bread. So delicious - it's pure foie gras. The taste is very strong and flavourful. A must for foie gras lovers :) I actually enjoyed this dish better without adding the jam on my slice of bread.FOIE GRAS POUTINE (5/5)A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! The closer you are to Montreal, the better the poutine gets and this one is a 5-star poutine for sure! Large slices of foie gras and big chunks of cheese.. mm fatty good!DUCK IN A CAN (5/5)So creative! It's a mini show when the waiter comes over and open the can in front of us (I recorded it all haha). The duck meat was tender and juicy - delicious. I would order this again the next time I visit Au Pied de Cochon.This place is the epitome of French Canadian cuisine.

I prefer the pickle, since I didn't try the tongue.Catch of the day, we picked the smoked eel. It also served with a piece of veal bone, you can eat the marrow(not sure if it's this word...).Fg poutine is great, although foie gras is too greasy for me.The duck in a can is great too. The duck is juicy and fresh, also with blood. The veggie taste a bit sour, really savory.The one missing star is for the dessert. Both icecream and pecan pie are too sweet for me to enjoy.After much hype, I made it here with a few colleagues on a Wednesday evening. The place was absolutely hopping and hard to get into, but we made a reservation a few weeks in advance.Once inside we sat at the bar, which is by far the best seat in the house. It comes with a direct view of the kitchen and all the goodness the chefs are whipping up. We started out with the ham special for appetizer, which was delicious. It came with a baguette and butter which made it perfect. We then had some poutine, which was also quite good. It was definitely better quality than most poutine dishes. For the main course, I went aggressive and got a mixed bowl consisting of blood sausage, pork sausage, mushrooms and onions sitting on top of mashed potatoes. The dish was very good, but not the amazing experience I was hoping for. Spices could have been a little better, but make no mistake it was a very good dish.With its popular reputation, upbeat atmosphere and good food, this is definitely a place worth visiting when in town. They also have a really good bar with interesting drinks. Great overall experience.Delicious food and a must if you're in Montreal. Come in hungry bc you'll get a rich and hearty meal. We ordered the infamous duck in a can, mushroom tortellini (tonites special), the steamed dumplings & plogue a Champlain "foie gras breakfast" - which was the highlight of the night. buckwheat pancake,  thick Canadian bacon, potatoes and cheese topped with foie gras. I wish it was one of the earlier items delivered I would have enjoyed a few more bites. Would def come here with a group to be able to taste more items on the menu. It's a busy restaurant so do make reservations. We scored 9:30 pm reservations on a Sunday night and place was packed with ppl still coming in with reservations after us. Service was slow and we had a really long wait b/t entrees coming out. We didn't leave until after 11:30. Luckily for us, our toddler was still on California time and was cooperative.Visit Montreal for a weekend and made a reservation two weeks in advance. Not too hard: I left a voicemail and someone called me back the next day. Between my friend and I, we ordered:- cromesquis de foie gras, basically deep fried fg. For $4, it was worth it. - temaki tartare, tartare Japanese hand roll. They didn't have bison available and we were offered veal. I quite enjoyed the layers of flavour and texture. - carpaccio de canard, duck carpaccio. My second favorite of the night. - and finally, poutine au foie gras. I hate to say it but this was a bit of a disappointment. I'm a fan of fg but this didn't have the ah-ha for me. We went later in the evening and 2 of the 3 cocktails were already sold out. My reco would be to go early. We also had a lot of trouble finding this place late at night. You really have to know what the front looks like!If you love pork and foie gras, this place is heaven. Recommend getting the foie gras poutine and the duck in a can. We also ordered the onion soup, duck carpaccio and the dumplings.Onion soup - your standard cheesy onion soup done right. Super tasty. Foie gras Poutine - must get!! Abundance of extra buttery and fatty foie gras with fries and gravy. This is a heavy dish so great for sharing and having a cold beer. Duck carpaccio - the presentation of the dish was beautiful. Thinly slice duck with chives, raw mushrooms and a yolk. Duck in a can - must get as well! The waiter brings over the can and opens it in front of the table. The content of the can contains the small duck, foie gras, cabbage which is all poured over the bread with carrot purée. The meat was tender and succulent.The service was very good - our waiter was extremely nice and helpful in making suggestions. There are so many options to choose from so it's great if you come with a big group and share everything!This place is insanely delicious.  The restaurant is a bit tight on space but the kitchen is opened. You can actually hear the staff call out orders.  There are so many options that we probably over ordered for two people!! For starters, we had poutine with foie gras, duck carpaccio and beef tongue.  For entrees we had the duck in a can and the blood sausage tart.  The duck in the can was amazing! We totally over did it on the foie gras but you only live once! We had so much foodWe had to call ahead so the restaurant could accommodate our baby.I went with a southern French person to this restaurant but he did not completely agree with my assessment. Just a caveat. :-)We really wanted to try a Montreal special, as this place is very well known. This place has the famous foie gras poutine and Duck in a Can. We decided to all share to try a few more dishes. The baguette is good!The ambience is nice. We went right when it opened and there was a small line waiting. You cannot get seated if you have not made a reservation. Plan ahead. 1. Garden salad: not on the menu, but we figured we were having so many animal parts this was probably a good idea. $15 for generic salad. The salad was fresh but basic. 2. Mushroom risotto: this dish is very expensive for what it is, but you get a show. They come to your table with a large cheese bowl and add the risotto, mushroom, and even Canadian bacon. This dish had potential but was much too salty. It was hard to finish. 3. Terragon Bison tongue: this is tongue well done. The texture is very soft, which is impressive given the quality of most tongues. The sauces and everything just work well together. However, it's game-y so just be warned. 4. Foie gras poutine: loved it. The fries were good. The gravy was also good. The foie gras was in large blocks and was nice and fatty. I think if you come here, you should get this dish! 5. Duck in a Can: I loved watching them pour half a duck out of a can. Life experience. It even looked nice coming out. The duck came out as a thick filet attached to a flap of lard and also fatty liver (foie gras). I enjoyed this dish very much. It was over puréed cauliflower. The issue I had was that the duck meat was very thick. I had to eat it with slices of the lard to complement the taste. Overall a good dish. 6. Dessert: we got the maple cake and the lemon pie. Both were pretty good. Get the maple cake for novelty sake! Very sweet but good flavors. It was a pricy meal, but for a specialty restaurant it made sense.When my friend and I were certain we wanted to try Au Pied de Cochon, I tried to make reservation (1 week in advance) but their voicemail box was full... I didn't know what to do except, trying to call in the following days... And finally, 2 days before the date we wanted to go, I was finally able to make a reservation (but there weren't any tables left, and the lady asked me if it was okay to be seated at the counter/bar, which I was fine with).Being seated at the counter/bar was actually one exciting experience since we were able to watch the chefs cook and take a glance at all the dishes other customers ordered! It was really mind-blowing watching them cook in a fast-moving environment! I really liked their open-kitchen. It was also fun to guess whether the dish was ours or not too (it was our first time at Au Pied de Cochon, so we didn't know what to expect!)Before coming to Au Pied de Cochon, I searched other people's reviews and made my mind that I wanted to try their Duck in a Can! And this was one of the two dishes we ordered. We didn't know what to order next and my friend thought the The PDC Melting Pot has an interesting name, so we ordered that! Our waiter served us bread and butter (we didn't eat a lot since we wanted to save the tummy for our main courses, but the bread was not too hard, it was perfect!)Duck in a Can: Ordered it like I said because a lot of reviews said it is a must there! It is without doubt an interesting and fun dish. It came in a heated can (like how the name of the dish suggested). So, the waiter brought it over and opened it in front of you, poured the content out of the can (which contains the duck breast, 100g of foie gras, cabbages, the sauce) over the bread with carrot and cauliflower purée. The meat was really tender and it went very well with the cabbage, especially when you eat it with a small piece of duck meat. I actually really like the cabbage! It balanced the richness of the duck meat and foie gras very well. The fat under the duck meat was so chewy (I like chewy stuff) but the other fat part was.... I didn't like it since it was too greasy but some people like the feeling of fat melting in the mouth. We finished the dish (expect for the fat part) since it was too much for us.Duck in a can was quite an experience to be honest, it might not be my favorite dish due to its richness and especially oiliness but it was definitely an unique and interesting experience due to the presentation of the dish in a can!PDC Melting Pot:We actually preferred the melting pot because the taste wasn't as heavy as Duck in a Can and the pot was full of surprises, which made it more interesting. This dish came in a pot which was already hinted with its name! There was pork sausages, shiitake mushrooms, buttery potato cheese which was like mashed potatoes with cheese at the bottom, blood sausage -boudin but it is not like the Asian style one-, pork belly (so yummy!), pork loin and onions. There were a lot of things inside the pot; a lots of surprises! I absolutely loved the "buttery potato cheese", it was so delicious and well-made! The pork was tender and everything in this pot went extremely well with the mashed potatoes! The onion sauce was perfect too! It was a rich dish but not overwhelming like Duck in a Can.We also ordered their Milkshake XXX. My thought of my first sip: this is quite sweet... But afterwards, it got better! I don't know what was inside this milkshake... It tasted like rum (I'm not sure if it contained alcohol though). This was one rich milkshake I would say!We were basically in a food coma after this! I would definitely like to come back again and try their bison tongue (saw good reviews about it!)P.S: Make sure to make a reservation!!! Keep on trying even when their voicemail box is full!Service is outstanding. The employees are so attentive and seem to really love their jobs. Food it also outstanding and some of the best I have had in Montreal. I will say the food is really heavy and I don't want to think about the fat and calories. You'll probably walk out having eaten 2000 calories and well over 50 grams of fat, per person. Then again, if you really care about that stuff, subways right around the corner. Treat yourself, check it out. You will not be disappointed.We came to celebrate my husband's birthday. We reserved via email. It's the easiest way. I highly recommend reserving this way. I do not recommend going on Sunday's. They're out of everything. They were out of a few items. I didn't care for some, but being out of Ribs, Sweetbread, and BEER?! That was very disappointing. I ended up getting the famous Duck in a Can. Great flavour. Very delicious. Duck cooked to perfection. Then the Ragout. I liked the texture and how all the ingredients complimented each other, but it was wayyy too salty. I loved how it was prepared in a cheese block in front of us. Our waitress was rude and short with everything. Uninformative. We felt very rushed by her. Pretty much everything sucked but the Duck in a Can. I will come back and perhaps the experience will be better to tie with the good food.One of the best restaurants I have ever been to (if not the best).I had the duck in a can and my friend the risotto.The risotto is mixed in inside a large parmeggiano cheesw block and the duck is cooked inside the can for 27 minutes to a perfect taste.What an experienceService was great too!!Ouff getting a reservation at au PdeC was not an easy task ... who still operates over voicemail? Especially over a voicemail box that is always full?!But au PdeC still seems to get away with it thanks to all the hype Anthony Bourdain created during his 24 hour Montreal layover (if you've never watched it: dailymotion.com/.../xo2k…...).Needless to say, we had to try it out ourselves or we couldn't be called true Montrealers. But the overwhelming foie gras stuffed courses were too much for two people to handle, so we brought 2 friends for back up! All in all, if you come knowing that this will not be a fine dining experience and that you WILL be overindulging in rich and heavy courses, then your experience will be a satisfying one. And let's be honest, everything just tastes better with fat!From the foie gras stuffed croquettes that just ooze in your mouth as you bite into them, to the decadent poutine topped with foie gras gravy and a whole piece of foie gras and then the squash risotto cooked in a whole wheel of parmesan...! Your reward center will be firing away happy signals for hours to come smile emoticonAll this goodness, paired with a nice bottle of french wine (they have an extensive french heavy wine list and some good beer on tap) made this a highly enjoyable 'tourist in your own city experience'. Good food, good wine and great company along with a surprisingly affordable tab... what's not to like?Heard lots of great reviews for Au Pied de Cochon. This restaurant was featured on one of the shows by Anthony Bourdain! Service was excellent.DRINKS:Pied de Cochon beer x 2TERRAINE OF FOIE GRAS (4/5)Came with jam and bread. So delicious - it's pure foie gras. The taste is very strong and flavourful. A must for foie gras lovers :) I actually enjoyed this dish better without adding the jam on my slice of bread.FOIE GRAS POUTINE (5/5)A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! The closer you are to Montreal, the better the poutine gets and this one is a 5-star poutine for sure! Large slices of foie gras and big chunks of cheese.. mm fatty good!DUCK IN A CAN (5/5)So creative! It's a mini show when the waiter comes over and open the can in front of us (I recorded it all haha). The duck meat was tender and juicy - delicious. I would order this again the next time I visit Au Pied de Cochon.This place is the epitome of French Canadian cuisine. If you want an authentic Canadian culinary experience then this is not to be missed. The food is not for the faint of hearts and definitely leave your vegetarian friends at home. I wouldn't say this is a good everyday-go-to kinda restaurant so come here when you have visitors from out of town or for a special occasion. On to our meal. After cleansing our palettes with foie gras croquettes, we were ready for our main event. We bravely ordered the whole pig's head for two and I can say that it has been one of my most memorable meals. The head of pig was roasted to glistening perfection. Paired with apple and root veggies, the whole plate was full of flavour and tender juicy porky deliciousness. Since they have an open kitchen, people took pictures of our food as it made its way towards our table. It was quite the show! Have to admit I couldn't eat pork for a couple of weeks after but it was definitely worth every bite. Eating at Au Pied is a special event you don't want to miss.Do you love ducks? Or better yet, do you hate ducks? To the point where you'll eat ducks in every form for 3 different dishes? If so, Au Pied de Cochon is just what the doctor ordered.Sure, the name translates to the pig's feet, but the duck is where it's at.Foie gras poutine is about as rich and delicious as it sounds.The duck in a can (which COMES WITH FOIE GRAS) is also a must. Just watching the waiter take a can opener to it and drop it onto a plate is a thing of beauty. The entire can is boiled and then brought out. All the spices are infused and all the fattiness is preserved without getting boiled off. Super unique. Just don't overdo it. One can is probably enough for 3-4 people unless you REALLY want to feel unhealthy.We also got a side of duck fat fries, because WHY THE HELL NOT?There were 8 of us, so we did a few other entrees as well. One was the PDC's cut, which the waiter told us was a boneless pork chop (there was a bone). It looked dry, but it was actually incredibly moist. It was a gigantic hunk of meat too.We also did one of the specials - the Ahi tuna steak for two. Let me tell you, it was NOT for two. Maybe if you fasted and that was the only thing you ate that day. But it was also good. Perfectly rare, with a ton of veggies and cheese on the side. It was probably our least favorite of the dishes, but even still, it was very well done.We were seated all the way in the back by the wine cellar, so it was a bit of a tight squeeze (especially with another large group next to us), but there wasn't much else to complain about. They also have one hell of a wine list.Our waiter was super cool and gave us shots to round out the night.Probably one of the best meals I've ever had. Also, why I came back to the States with none of pants fitting anymore.Make reservations! Either call/email or reserve online. It's a must. Also come hungry, because, they serve a lot of food.This place gets super packed during the dinner rush. Even dining at the counter gets full.I'd recommend the foie gras duo to get the best out of APC. If you're dining with friends, then I'm sure you can taste each other's food. But for a single diner like myself, the foie gras duo comes with Foie Gras burger and foie gras poutine fries. Huge portions for about $50. Very fatty, very rich, and very good.I started off with the tuna tartare as an appetizer, but even though it is a small portion, I couldn't get through my foie gras duo because of the enormity of the portions. The tuna tartare was tarty and fresh.And I still wanted dessert after and I chose the toffee maple milk shake. They made it right in front me...I guess because I was in the counter, but you can see all the fatty goodness when they make this. Not to sweet, but I had enough room to finish it. I would order this again.Trying to find street parking might be hard for you during dinner time. And the metro station is several blocks away. You can probably try the bixi bikes if you have time to roam around this part of the Montreal neighborhood.Drip Drip Drip4 star for food and service but -0.5 star for all the water dripping from the vent on top of my head all through my dinner.Drip Drip Dip I know it was one of the hottest weekend in Montreal. It was end of July after all and I should be thankful for the nice cool interior of the restaurant with their AC on full blast. But with the water dripping on me the whole time (2 hour) while I was enjoying my dinner was not cool. The staff was all trying their best to stop the dripping from top of the AC vent which ran across the full depth of the restaurant by a squeegee sponge but it was not working....Drip Drip DripDinner was really good!! Excellent!We shared Tarragon Bison Tongue ($8.50) - I just love the Cornichon in that! And now I have a bottle in my fridge at home!Pâté de Campagne ($9) - So smooth and rich!Duck Carpaccio ($14) - Well seasoned, my first time having duck carpaccioDuck in a Can ($44) - So overhyped! The duck was dry and just not good! Foie Gras was so so. I don't believe I said that but I preferred mine seared...Braised Pig Feet with Side Pasta ($50) Seasonal - Must Order!! It was so tender and flavoured!! And the pasta which was prepared table side was so good! Perfect al dente and with BACON... Drip Drip DripI would have up my star to a 4 because the food was just amazing and the service was excellent. But the management really need to do something about their cooling system. I definitely would be back! PS The reservation system just got so much better as my reservation was confirmed by email and no need to play phone tag again!We had the foie gras poutine, stuffed pied de cochon with foie gras and a tuna dish. All were very rich in flavor and will lead to a heart attack BUT worth every bite. Poutine- get it! after all it is a Canadian dishStuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras- this is large enough for 3-4 people to share, the best part about this dish was the MASHED POTATO, it is sooooooooo good! it has a different texture from the typical mushy mashed potato. Tuna dish- our waiter picked this for us so I don't know what it's called but it's a pretty good dish with gravy and mashed potato on the bottom but it was a little salty though. Overall, amazing FATTY French Canadian food.Very rich food. If you like your food too creamy or too buttery, then this is your type of food. Everything was just very heavy and I couldn't seem to finish the dish. The FG is actually not bad as this was my first time tasting it. Definitely not something I would typically eat but at least I tried it! Plogue Champlain $29Pork filet $30Fg hamburger $39Squash risotto $24Fg poutine $24Eel tart $14The place was jam packed and there's absolutely no room to move if you're sitting on the outside of the table. Service is slow because of how busy it is. Might take you 10min to get the attention of a waitress and another 10 for the bill. Overall definitely a place to try but not something I would do again as its not really my type of food fare.I am judging overall as a meal and the service. First off, the place doesnt have a banner so it is difficult to spot if you dont know where it is. Foie gras poutine. Very good, the foie gras melted in with the poutine and you were able to taste the foie gras. The texture or the plate was consistant, there was cheesy, crispy and then the foie gras made it very good. you were able to taste that the fries were fried in the duck fat and the gravy was creamy and rich. with that being said, a very good dish but will get heavy and sickening after you eat too much of it.Foie gras a la champlain. foie gras on top of a thick slice of bacon, on a bed of thin crispy potato pancake (like a thin hashbrown), topped with a generous amount of maple syrup sauce. First bite was veryyyyy good!! So cripsy from the potato, the bacon was thick and the foie gras was enhanced in this plate, the maple syrup sauce was a good amount of sweet and salty. But this is definitely not a plate you eat on your own, its best for sharing because after a while the taste and maple syrup is quite overwhelming. table side Squash risotto. risotto was cooked very well but since it was table side she made it in the a large parmesan cheese, mixed it all together. She over poured the chicken broth and the risotto became a soup. The waiter asked how it was and I told him honestly that I did not like it because it was too watery. He left then about 3-4 mins later he asked me "do you want me to take it to the chef to try it", well no obviously not! She should have known when she served it because it was clearly too watery. He knew I was unhappy and he was the one that was pushing for this squash risotto, he didnt do anything to make up for the bad dish. At a resto like that I would expect so much more. Overall, theres definitely better. I'm glad I tried it but I would not be returning.We made the reservation two weeks ago. Probably because it's weekday, we are the only customers at 5:00pm.We didn't drink alcohol, only a bottle of water. The water is in glass bottle, taste better than thesame brand in plastic bottle.Tarragon Bison Tongue is the first dish. The tongue is from beef. Mr. Tang said it's good. I prefer the pickle, since I didn't try the tongue.Catch of the day, we picked the smoked eel.

There was pork sausages, shiitake mushrooms, buttery potato cheese which was like mashed potatoes with cheese at the bottom, blood sausage -boudin but it is not like the Asian style one-, pork belly (so yummy!), pork loin and onions. There were a lot of things inside the pot; a lots of surprises! I absolutely loved the "buttery potato cheese", it was so delicious and well-made! The pork was tender and everything in this pot went extremely well with the mashed potatoes! The onion sauce was perfect too! It was a rich dish but not overwhelming like Duck in a Can.We also ordered their Milkshake XXX. My thought of my first sip: this is quite sweet... But afterwards, it got better! I don't know what was inside this milkshake... It tasted like rum (I'm not sure if it contained alcohol though). This was one rich milkshake I would say!We were basically in a food coma after this! I would definitely like to come back again and try their bison tongue (saw good reviews about it!)P.S: Make sure to make a reservation!!! Keep on trying even when their voicemail box is full!Service is outstanding. The employees are so attentive and seem to really love their jobs. Food it also outstanding and some of the best I have had in Montreal. I will say the food is really heavy and I don't want to think about the fat and calories. You'll probably walk out having eaten 2000 calories and well over 50 grams of fat, per person. Then again, if you really care about that stuff, subways right around the corner. Treat yourself, check it out. You will not be disappointed.We came to celebrate my husband's birthday. We reserved via email. It's the easiest way. I highly recommend reserving this way. I do not recommend going on Sunday's. They're out of everything. They were out of a few items. I didn't care for some, but being out of Ribs, Sweetbread, and BEER?! That was very disappointing. I ended up getting the famous Duck in a Can. Great flavour. Very delicious. Duck cooked to perfection. Then the Ragout. I liked the texture and how all the ingredients complimented each other, but it was wayyy too salty. I loved how it was prepared in a cheese block in front of us. Our waitress was rude and short with everything. Uninformative. We felt very rushed by her. Pretty much everything sucked but the Duck in a Can. I will come back and perhaps the experience will be better to tie with the good food.One of the best restaurants I have ever been to (if not the best).I had the duck in a can and my friend the risotto.The risotto is mixed in inside a large parmeggiano cheesw block and the duck is cooked inside the can for 27 minutes to a perfect taste.What an experienceService was great too!!Ouff getting a reservation at au PdeC was not an easy task ... who still operates over voicemail? Especially over a voicemail box that is always full?!But au PdeC still seems to get away with it thanks to all the hype Anthony Bourdain created during his 24 hour Montreal layover (if you've never watched it: dailymotion.com/.../xo2k…...).Needless to say, we had to try it out ourselves or we couldn't be called true Montrealers. But the overwhelming foie gras stuffed courses were too much for two people to handle, so we brought 2 friends for back up! All in all, if you come knowing that this will not be a fine dining experience and that you WILL be overindulging in rich and heavy courses, then your experience will be a satisfying one. And let's be honest, everything just tastes better with fat!From the foie gras stuffed croquettes that just ooze in your mouth as you bite into them, to the decadent poutine topped with foie gras gravy and a whole piece of foie gras and then the squash risotto cooked in a whole wheel of parmesan...! Your reward center will be firing away happy signals for hours to come smile emoticonAll this goodness, paired with a nice bottle of french wine (they have an extensive french heavy wine list and some good beer on tap) made this a highly enjoyable 'tourist in your own city experience'. Good food, good wine and great company along with a surprisingly affordable tab... what's not to like?Heard lots of great reviews for Au Pied de Cochon. This restaurant was featured on one of the shows by Anthony Bourdain! Service was excellent.DRINKS:Pied de Cochon beer x 2TERRAINE OF FOIE GRAS (4/5)Came with jam and bread. So delicious - it's pure foie gras. The taste is very strong and flavourful. A must for foie gras lovers :) I actually enjoyed this dish better without adding the jam on my slice of bread.FOIE GRAS POUTINE (5/5)A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! The closer you are to Montreal, the better the poutine gets and this one is a 5-star poutine for sure! Large slices of foie gras and big chunks of cheese.. mm fatty good!DUCK IN A CAN (5/5)So creative! It's a mini show when the waiter comes over and open the can in front of us (I recorded it all haha). The duck meat was tender and juicy - delicious. I would order this again the next time I visit Au Pied de Cochon.This place is the epitome of French Canadian cuisine. If you want an authentic Canadian culinary experience then this is not to be missed. The food is not for the faint of hearts and definitely leave your vegetarian friends at home. I wouldn't say this is a good everyday-go-to kinda restaurant so come here when you have visitors from out of town or for a special occasion. On to our meal. After cleansing our palettes with foie gras croquettes, we were ready for our main event. We bravely ordered the whole pig's head for two and I can say that it has been one of my most memorable meals. The head of pig was roasted to glistening perfection. Paired with apple and root veggies, the whole plate was full of flavour and tender juicy porky deliciousness. Since they have an open kitchen, people took pictures of our food as it made its way towards our table. It was quite the show! Have to admit I couldn't eat pork for a couple of weeks after but it was definitely worth every bite. Eating at Au Pied is a special event you don't want to miss.Do you love ducks? Or better yet, do you hate ducks? To the point where you'll eat ducks in every form for 3 different dishes? If so, Au Pied de Cochon is just what the doctor ordered.Sure, the name translates to the pig's feet, but the duck is where it's at.Foie gras poutine is about as rich and delicious as it sounds.The duck in a can (which COMES WITH FOIE GRAS) is also a must. Just watching the waiter take a can opener to it and drop it onto a plate is a thing of beauty. The entire can is boiled and then brought out. All the spices are infused and all the fattiness is preserved without getting boiled off. Super unique. Just don't overdo it. One can is probably enough for 3-4 people unless you REALLY want to feel unhealthy.We also got a side of duck fat fries, because WHY THE HELL NOT?There were 8 of us, so we did a few other entrees as well. One was the PDC's cut, which the waiter told us was a boneless pork chop (there was a bone). It looked dry, but it was actually incredibly moist. It was a gigantic hunk of meat too.We also did one of the specials - the Ahi tuna steak for two. Let me tell you, it was NOT for two. Maybe if you fasted and that was the only thing you ate that day. But it was also good. Perfectly rare, with a ton of veggies and cheese on the side. It was probably our least favorite of the dishes, but even still, it was very well done.We were seated all the way in the back by the wine cellar, so it was a bit of a tight squeeze (especially with another large group next to us), but there wasn't much else to complain about. They also have one hell of a wine list.Our waiter was super cool and gave us shots to round out the night.Probably one of the best meals I've ever had. Also, why I came back to the States with none of pants fitting anymore.Make reservations! Either call/email or reserve online. It's a must. Also come hungry, because, they serve a lot of food.This place gets super packed during the dinner rush. Even dining at the counter gets full.I'd recommend the foie gras duo to get the best out of APC. If you're dining with friends, then I'm sure you can taste each other's food. But for a single diner like myself, the foie gras duo comes with Foie Gras burger and foie gras poutine fries. Huge portions for about $50. Very fatty, very rich, and very good.I started off with the tuna tartare as an appetizer, but even though it is a small portion, I couldn't get through my foie gras duo because of the enormity of the portions. The tuna tartare was tarty and fresh.And I still wanted dessert after and I chose the toffee maple milk shake. They made it right in front me...I guess because I was in the counter, but you can see all the fatty goodness when they make this. Not to sweet, but I had enough room to finish it. I would order this again.Trying to find street parking might be hard for you during dinner time. And the metro station is several blocks away. You can probably try the bixi bikes if you have time to roam around this part of the Montreal neighborhood.Drip Drip Drip4 star for food and service but -0.5 star for all the water dripping from the vent on top of my head all through my dinner.Drip Drip Dip I know it was one of the hottest weekend in Montreal. It was end of July after all and I should be thankful for the nice cool interior of the restaurant with their AC on full blast. But with the water dripping on me the whole time (2 hour) while I was enjoying my dinner was not cool. The staff was all trying their best to stop the dripping from top of the AC vent which ran across the full depth of the restaurant by a squeegee sponge but it was not working....Drip Drip DripDinner was really good!! Excellent!We shared Tarragon Bison Tongue ($8.50) - I just love the Cornichon in that! And now I have a bottle in my fridge at home!Pâté de Campagne ($9) - So smooth and rich!Duck Carpaccio ($14) - Well seasoned, my first time having duck carpaccioDuck in a Can ($44) - So overhyped! The duck was dry and just not good! Foie Gras was so so. I don't believe I said that but I preferred mine seared...Braised Pig Feet with Side Pasta ($50) Seasonal - Must Order!! It was so tender and flavoured!! And the pasta which was prepared table side was so good! Perfect al dente and with BACON... Drip Drip DripI would have up my star to a 4 because the food was just amazing and the service was excellent. But the management really need to do something about their cooling system. I definitely would be back! PS The reservation system just got so much better as my reservation was confirmed by email and no need to play phone tag again!We had the foie gras poutine, stuffed pied de cochon with foie gras and a tuna dish. All were very rich in flavor and will lead to a heart attack BUT worth every bite. Poutine- get it! after all it is a Canadian dishStuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras- this is large enough for 3-4 people to share, the best part about this dish was the MASHED POTATO, it is sooooooooo good! it has a different texture from the typical mushy mashed potato. Tuna dish- our waiter picked this for us so I don't know what it's called but it's a pretty good dish with gravy and mashed potato on the bottom but it was a little salty though. Overall, amazing FATTY French Canadian food.Very rich food. If you like your food too creamy or too buttery, then this is your type of food. Everything was just very heavy and I couldn't seem to finish the dish. The FG is actually not bad as this was my first time tasting it. Definitely not something I would typically eat but at least I tried it! Plogue Champlain $29Pork filet $30Fg hamburger $39Squash risotto $24Fg poutine $24Eel tart $14The place was jam packed and there's absolutely no room to move if you're sitting on the outside of the table. Service is slow because of how busy it is. Might take you 10min to get the attention of a waitress and another 10 for the bill. Overall definitely a place to try but not something I would do again as its not really my type of food fare.I am judging overall as a meal and the service. First off, the place doesnt have a banner so it is difficult to spot if you dont know where it is. Foie gras poutine. Very good, the foie gras melted in with the poutine and you were able to taste the foie gras. The texture or the plate was consistant, there was cheesy, crispy and then the foie gras made it very good. you were able to taste that the fries were fried in the duck fat and the gravy was creamy and rich. with that being said, a very good dish but will get heavy and sickening after you eat too much of it.Foie gras a la champlain. foie gras on top of a thick slice of bacon, on a bed of thin crispy potato pancake (like a thin hashbrown), topped with a generous amount of maple syrup sauce. First bite was veryyyyy good!! So cripsy from the potato, the bacon was thick and the foie gras was enhanced in this plate, the maple syrup sauce was a good amount of sweet and salty. But this is definitely not a plate you eat on your own, its best for sharing because after a while the taste and maple syrup is quite overwhelming. table side Squash risotto. risotto was cooked very well but since it was table side she made it in the a large parmesan cheese, mixed it all together. She over poured the chicken broth and the risotto became a soup. The waiter asked how it was and I told him honestly that I did not like it because it was too watery. He left then about 3-4 mins later he asked me "do you want me to take it to the chef to try it", well no obviously not! She should have known when she served it because it was clearly too watery. He knew I was unhappy and he was the one that was pushing for this squash risotto, he didnt do anything to make up for the bad dish. At a resto like that I would expect so much more. Overall, theres definitely better. I'm glad I tried it but I would not be returning.We made the reservation two weeks ago. Probably because it's weekday, we are the only customers at 5:00pm.We didn't drink alcohol, only a bottle of water. The water is in glass bottle, taste better than thesame brand in plastic bottle.Tarragon Bison Tongue is the first dish. The tongue is from beef. Mr. Tang said it's good. I prefer the pickle, since I didn't try the tongue.Catch of the day, we picked the smoked eel. It also served with a piece of veal bone, you can eat the marrow(not sure if it's this word...).Fg poutine is great, although foie gras is too greasy for me.The duck in a can is great too. The duck is juicy and fresh, also with blood. The veggie taste a bit sour, really savory.The one missing star is for the dessert. Both icecream and pecan pie are too sweet for me to enjoy.After much hype, I made it here with a few colleagues on a Wednesday evening. The place was absolutely hopping and hard to get into, but we made a reservation a few weeks in advance.Once inside we sat at the bar, which is by far the best seat in the house. It comes with a direct view of the kitchen and all the goodness the chefs are whipping up. We started out with the ham special for appetizer, which was delicious. It came with a baguette and butter which made it perfect. We then had some poutine, which was also quite good. It was definitely better quality than most poutine dishes. For the main course, I went aggressive and got a mixed bowl consisting of blood sausage, pork sausage, mushrooms and onions sitting on top of mashed potatoes. The dish was very good, but not the amazing experience I was hoping for. Spices could have been a little better, but make no mistake it was a very good dish.With its popular reputation, upbeat atmosphere and good food, this is definitely a place worth visiting when in town. They also have a really good bar with interesting drinks. Great overall experience.Delicious food and a must if you're in Montreal. Come in hungry bc you'll get a rich and hearty meal. We ordered the infamous duck in a can, mushroom tortellini (tonites special), the steamed dumplings & plogue a Champlain "foie gras breakfast" - which was the highlight of the night. buckwheat pancake,  thick Canadian bacon, potatoes and cheese topped with foie gras. I wish it was one of the earlier items delivered I would have enjoyed a few more bites. Would def come here with a group to be able to taste more items on the menu. It's a busy restaurant so do make reservations. We scored 9:30 pm reservations on a Sunday night and place was packed with ppl still coming in with reservations after us. Service was slow and we had a really long wait b/t entrees coming out. We didn't leave until after 11:30. Luckily for us, our toddler was still on California time and was cooperative.Visit Montreal for a weekend and made a reservation two weeks in advance. Not too hard: I left a voicemail and someone called me back the next day. Between my friend and I, we ordered:- cromesquis de foie gras, basically deep fried fg. For $4, it was worth it. - temaki tartare, tartare Japanese hand roll. They didn't have bison available and we were offered veal. I quite enjoyed the layers of flavour and texture. - carpaccio de canard, duck carpaccio. My second favorite of the night. - and finally, poutine au foie gras. I hate to say it but this was a bit of a disappointment. I'm a fan of fg but this didn't have the ah-ha for me. We went later in the evening and 2 of the 3 cocktails were already sold out. My reco would be to go early. We also had a lot of trouble finding this place late at night. You really have to know what the front looks like!If you love pork and foie gras, this place is heaven. Recommend getting the foie gras poutine and the duck in a can. We also ordered the onion soup, duck carpaccio and the dumplings.Onion soup - your standard cheesy onion soup done right. Super tasty. Foie gras Poutine - must get!! Abundance of extra buttery and fatty foie gras with fries and gravy. This is a heavy dish so great for sharing and having a cold beer. Duck carpaccio - the presentation of the dish was beautiful. Thinly slice duck with chives, raw mushrooms and a yolk. Duck in a can - must get as well! The waiter brings over the can and opens it in front of the table. The content of the can contains the small duck, foie gras, cabbage which is all poured over the bread with carrot purée. The meat was tender and succulent.The service was very good - our waiter was extremely nice and helpful in making suggestions. There are so many options to choose from so it's great if you come with a big group and share everything!This place is insanely delicious.  The restaurant is a bit tight on space but the kitchen is opened. You can actually hear the staff call out orders.  There are so many options that we probably over ordered for two people!! For starters, we had poutine with foie gras, duck carpaccio and beef tongue.  For entrees we had the duck in a can and the blood sausage tart.  The duck in the can was amazing! We totally over did it on the foie gras but you only live once! We had so much foodWe had to call ahead so the restaurant could accommodate our baby.I went with a southern French person to this restaurant but he did not completely agree with my assessment. Just a caveat. :-)We really wanted to try a Montreal special, as this place is very well known. This place has the famous foie gras poutine and Duck in a Can. We decided to all share to try a few more dishes. The baguette is good!The ambience is nice. We went right when it opened and there was a small line waiting. You cannot get seated if you have not made a reservation. Plan ahead. 1. Garden salad: not on the menu, but we figured we were having so many animal parts this was probably a good idea. $15 for generic salad. The salad was fresh but basic. 2. Mushroom risotto: this dish is very expensive for what it is, but you get a show. They come to your table with a large cheese bowl and add the risotto, mushroom, and even Canadian bacon. This dish had potential but was much too salty. It was hard to finish. 3. Terragon Bison tongue: this is tongue well done. The texture is very soft, which is impressive given the quality of most tongues. The sauces and everything just work well together. However, it's game-y so just be warned. 4. Foie gras poutine: loved it. The fries were good. The gravy was also good. The foie gras was in large blocks and was nice and fatty. I think if you come here, you should get this dish! 5. Duck in a Can: I loved watching them pour half a duck out of a can. Life experience. It even looked nice coming out. The duck came out as a thick filet attached to a flap of lard and also fatty liver (foie gras). I enjoyed this dish very much. It was over puréed cauliflower. The issue I had was that the duck meat was very thick. I had to eat it with slices of the lard to complement the taste. Overall a good dish. 6. Dessert: we got the maple cake and the lemon pie. Both were pretty good. Get the maple cake for novelty sake! Very sweet but good flavors. It was a pricy meal, but for a specialty restaurant it made sense.When my friend and I were certain we wanted to try Au Pied de Cochon, I tried to make reservation (1 week in advance) but their voicemail box was full... I didn't know what to do except, trying to call in the following days... And finally, 2 days before the date we wanted to go, I was finally able to make a reservation (but there weren't any tables left, and the lady asked me if it was okay to be seated at the counter/bar, which I was fine with).Being seated at the counter/bar was actually one exciting experience since we were able to watch the chefs cook and take a glance at all the dishes other customers ordered! It was really mind-blowing watching them cook in a fast-moving environment! I really liked their open-kitchen. It was also fun to guess whether the dish was ours or not too (it was our first time at Au Pied de Cochon, so we didn't know what to expect!)Before coming to Au Pied de Cochon, I searched other people's reviews and made my mind that I wanted to try their Duck in a Can! And this was one of the two dishes we ordered. We didn't know what to order next and my friend thought the The PDC Melting Pot has an interesting name, so we ordered that! Our waiter served us bread and butter (we didn't eat a lot since we wanted to save the tummy for our main courses, but the bread was not too hard, it was perfect!)Duck in a Can: Ordered it like I said because a lot of reviews said it is a must there! It is without doubt an interesting and fun dish. It came in a heated can (like how the name of the dish suggested). So, the waiter brought it over and opened it in front of you, poured the content out of the can (which contains the duck breast, 100g of foie gras, cabbages, the sauce) over the bread with carrot and cauliflower purée. The meat was really tender and it went very well with the cabbage, especially when you eat it with a small piece of duck meat. I actually really like the cabbage! It balanced the richness of the duck meat and foie gras very well. The fat under the duck meat was so chewy (I like chewy stuff) but the other fat part was.... I didn't like it since it was too greasy but some people like the feeling of fat melting in the mouth. We finished the dish (expect for the fat part) since it was too much for us.Duck in a can was quite an experience to be honest, it might not be my favorite dish due to its richness and especially oiliness but it was definitely an unique and interesting experience due to the presentation of the dish in a can!PDC Melting Pot:We actually preferred the melting pot because the taste wasn't as heavy as Duck in a Can and the pot was full of surprises, which made it more interesting.

It was end of July after all and I should be thankful for the nice cool interior of the restaurant with their AC on full blast. But with the water dripping on me the whole time (2 hour) while I was enjoying my dinner was not cool. The staff was all trying their best to stop the dripping from top of the AC vent which ran across the full depth of the restaurant by a squeegee sponge but it was not working....Drip Drip DripDinner was really good!! Excellent!We shared Tarragon Bison Tongue ($8.50) - I just love the Cornichon in that! And now I have a bottle in my fridge at home!Pâté de Campagne ($9) - So smooth and rich!Duck Carpaccio ($14) - Well seasoned, my first time having duck carpaccioDuck in a Can ($44) - So overhyped! The duck was dry and just not good! Foie Gras was so so. I don't believe I said that but I preferred mine seared...Braised Pig Feet with Side Pasta ($50) Seasonal - Must Order!! It was so tender and flavoured!! And the pasta which was prepared table side was so good! Perfect al dente and with BACON... Drip Drip DripI would have up my star to a 4 because the food was just amazing and the service was excellent. But the management really need to do something about their cooling system. I definitely would be back! PS The reservation system just got so much better as my reservation was confirmed by email and no need to play phone tag again!We had the foie gras poutine, stuffed pied de cochon with foie gras and a tuna dish. All were very rich in flavor and will lead to a heart attack BUT worth every bite. Poutine- get it! after all it is a Canadian dishStuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras- this is large enough for 3-4 people to share, the best part about this dish was the MASHED POTATO, it is sooooooooo good! it has a different texture from the typical mushy mashed potato. Tuna dish- our waiter picked this for us so I don't know what it's called but it's a pretty good dish with gravy and mashed potato on the bottom but it was a little salty though. Overall, amazing FATTY French Canadian food.Very rich food. If you like your food too creamy or too buttery, then this is your type of food. Everything was just very heavy and I couldn't seem to finish the dish. The FG is actually not bad as this was my first time tasting it. Definitely not something I would typically eat but at least I tried it! Plogue Champlain $29Pork filet $30Fg hamburger $39Squash risotto $24Fg poutine $24Eel tart $14The place was jam packed and there's absolutely no room to move if you're sitting on the outside of the table. Service is slow because of how busy it is. Might take you 10min to get the attention of a waitress and another 10 for the bill. Overall definitely a place to try but not something I would do again as its not really my type of food fare.I am judging overall as a meal and the service. First off, the place doesnt have a banner so it is difficult to spot if you dont know where it is. Foie gras poutine. Very good, the foie gras melted in with the poutine and you were able to taste the foie gras. The texture or the plate was consistant, there was cheesy, crispy and then the foie gras made it very good. you were able to taste that the fries were fried in the duck fat and the gravy was creamy and rich. with that being said, a very good dish but will get heavy and sickening after you eat too much of it.Foie gras a la champlain. foie gras on top of a thick slice of bacon, on a bed of thin crispy potato pancake (like a thin hashbrown), topped with a generous amount of maple syrup sauce. First bite was veryyyyy good!! So cripsy from the potato, the bacon was thick and the foie gras was enhanced in this plate, the maple syrup sauce was a good amount of sweet and salty. But this is definitely not a plate you eat on your own, its best for sharing because after a while the taste and maple syrup is quite overwhelming. table side Squash risotto. risotto was cooked very well but since it was table side she made it in the a large parmesan cheese, mixed it all together. She over poured the chicken broth and the risotto became a soup. The waiter asked how it was and I told him honestly that I did not like it because it was too watery. He left then about 3-4 mins later he asked me "do you want me to take it to the chef to try it", well no obviously not! She should have known when she served it because it was clearly too watery. He knew I was unhappy and he was the one that was pushing for this squash risotto, he didnt do anything to make up for the bad dish. At a resto like that I would expect so much more. Overall, theres definitely better. I'm glad I tried it but I would not be returning.We made the reservation two weeks ago. Probably because it's weekday, we are the only customers at 5:00pm.We didn't drink alcohol, only a bottle of water. The water is in glass bottle, taste better than thesame brand in plastic bottle.Tarragon Bison Tongue is the first dish. The tongue is from beef. Mr. Tang said it's good. I prefer the pickle, since I didn't try the tongue.Catch of the day, we picked the smoked eel. It also served with a piece of veal bone, you can eat the marrow(not sure if it's this word...).Fg poutine is great, although foie gras is too greasy for me.The duck in a can is great too. The duck is juicy and fresh, also with blood. The veggie taste a bit sour, really savory.The one missing star is for the dessert. Both icecream and pecan pie are too sweet for me to enjoy.After much hype, I made it here with a few colleagues on a Wednesday evening. The place was absolutely hopping and hard to get into, but we made a reservation a few weeks in advance.Once inside we sat at the bar, which is by far the best seat in the house. It comes with a direct view of the kitchen and all the goodness the chefs are whipping up. We started out with the ham special for appetizer, which was delicious. It came with a baguette and butter which made it perfect. We then had some poutine, which was also quite good. It was definitely better quality than most poutine dishes. For the main course, I went aggressive and got a mixed bowl consisting of blood sausage, pork sausage, mushrooms and onions sitting on top of mashed potatoes. The dish was very good, but not the amazing experience I was hoping for. Spices could have been a little better, but make no mistake it was a very good dish.With its popular reputation, upbeat atmosphere and good food, this is definitely a place worth visiting when in town. They also have a really good bar with interesting drinks. Great overall experience.Delicious food and a must if you're in Montreal. Come in hungry bc you'll get a rich and hearty meal. We ordered the infamous duck in a can, mushroom tortellini (tonites special), the steamed dumplings & plogue a Champlain "foie gras breakfast" - which was the highlight of the night. buckwheat pancake,  thick Canadian bacon, potatoes and cheese topped with foie gras. I wish it was one of the earlier items delivered I would have enjoyed a few more bites. Would def come here with a group to be able to taste more items on the menu. It's a busy restaurant so do make reservations. We scored 9:30 pm reservations on a Sunday night and place was packed with ppl still coming in with reservations after us. Service was slow and we had a really long wait b/t entrees coming out. We didn't leave until after 11:30. Luckily for us, our toddler was still on California time and was cooperative.Visit Montreal for a weekend and made a reservation two weeks in advance. Not too hard: I left a voicemail and someone called me back the next day. Between my friend and I, we ordered:- cromesquis de foie gras, basically deep fried fg. For $4, it was worth it. - temaki tartare, tartare Japanese hand roll. They didn't have bison available and we were offered veal. I quite enjoyed the layers of flavour and texture. - carpaccio de canard, duck carpaccio. My second favorite of the night. - and finally, poutine au foie gras. I hate to say it but this was a bit of a disappointment. I'm a fan of fg but this didn't have the ah-ha for me. We went later in the evening and 2 of the 3 cocktails were already sold out. My reco would be to go early. We also had a lot of trouble finding this place late at night. You really have to know what the front looks like!If you love pork and foie gras, this place is heaven. Recommend getting the foie gras poutine and the duck in a can. We also ordered the onion soup, duck carpaccio and the dumplings.Onion soup - your standard cheesy onion soup done right. Super tasty. Foie gras Poutine - must get!! Abundance of extra buttery and fatty foie gras with fries and gravy. This is a heavy dish so great for sharing and having a cold beer. Duck carpaccio - the presentation of the dish was beautiful. Thinly slice duck with chives, raw mushrooms and a yolk. Duck in a can - must get as well! The waiter brings over the can and opens it in front of the table. The content of the can contains the small duck, foie gras, cabbage which is all poured over the bread with carrot purée. The meat was tender and succulent.The service was very good - our waiter was extremely nice and helpful in making suggestions. There are so many options to choose from so it's great if you come with a big group and share everything!This place is insanely delicious.  The restaurant is a bit tight on space but the kitchen is opened. You can actually hear the staff call out orders.  There are so many options that we probably over ordered for two people!! For starters, we had poutine with foie gras, duck carpaccio and beef tongue.  For entrees we had the duck in a can and the blood sausage tart.  The duck in the can was amazing! We totally over did it on the foie gras but you only live once! We had so much foodWe had to call ahead so the restaurant could accommodate our baby.I went with a southern French person to this restaurant but he did not completely agree with my assessment. Just a caveat. :-)We really wanted to try a Montreal special, as this place is very well known. This place has the famous foie gras poutine and Duck in a Can. We decided to all share to try a few more dishes. The baguette is good!The ambience is nice. We went right when it opened and there was a small line waiting. You cannot get seated if you have not made a reservation. Plan ahead. 1. Garden salad: not on the menu, but we figured we were having so many animal parts this was probably a good idea. $15 for generic salad. The salad was fresh but basic. 2. Mushroom risotto: this dish is very expensive for what it is, but you get a show. They come to your table with a large cheese bowl and add the risotto, mushroom, and even Canadian bacon. This dish had potential but was much too salty. It was hard to finish. 3. Terragon Bison tongue: this is tongue well done. The texture is very soft, which is impressive given the quality of most tongues. The sauces and everything just work well together. However, it's game-y so just be warned. 4. Foie gras poutine: loved it. The fries were good. The gravy was also good. The foie gras was in large blocks and was nice and fatty. I think if you come here, you should get this dish! 5. Duck in a Can: I loved watching them pour half a duck out of a can. Life experience. It even looked nice coming out. The duck came out as a thick filet attached to a flap of lard and also fatty liver (foie gras). I enjoyed this dish very much. It was over puréed cauliflower. The issue I had was that the duck meat was very thick. I had to eat it with slices of the lard to complement the taste. Overall a good dish. 6. Dessert: we got the maple cake and the lemon pie. Both were pretty good. Get the maple cake for novelty sake! Very sweet but good flavors. It was a pricy meal, but for a specialty restaurant it made sense.When my friend and I were certain we wanted to try Au Pied de Cochon, I tried to make reservation (1 week in advance) but their voicemail box was full... I didn't know what to do except, trying to call in the following days... And finally, 2 days before the date we wanted to go, I was finally able to make a reservation (but there weren't any tables left, and the lady asked me if it was okay to be seated at the counter/bar, which I was fine with).Being seated at the counter/bar was actually one exciting experience since we were able to watch the chefs cook and take a glance at all the dishes other customers ordered! It was really mind-blowing watching them cook in a fast-moving environment! I really liked their open-kitchen. It was also fun to guess whether the dish was ours or not too (it was our first time at Au Pied de Cochon, so we didn't know what to expect!)Before coming to Au Pied de Cochon, I searched other people's reviews and made my mind that I wanted to try their Duck in a Can! And this was one of the two dishes we ordered. We didn't know what to order next and my friend thought the The PDC Melting Pot has an interesting name, so we ordered that! Our waiter served us bread and butter (we didn't eat a lot since we wanted to save the tummy for our main courses, but the bread was not too hard, it was perfect!)Duck in a Can: Ordered it like I said because a lot of reviews said it is a must there! It is without doubt an interesting and fun dish. It came in a heated can (like how the name of the dish suggested). So, the waiter brought it over and opened it in front of you, poured the content out of the can (which contains the duck breast, 100g of foie gras, cabbages, the sauce) over the bread with carrot and cauliflower purée. The meat was really tender and it went very well with the cabbage, especially when you eat it with a small piece of duck meat. I actually really like the cabbage! It balanced the richness of the duck meat and foie gras very well. The fat under the duck meat was so chewy (I like chewy stuff) but the other fat part was.... I didn't like it since it was too greasy but some people like the feeling of fat melting in the mouth. We finished the dish (expect for the fat part) since it was too much for us.Duck in a can was quite an experience to be honest, it might not be my favorite dish due to its richness and especially oiliness but it was definitely an unique and interesting experience due to the presentation of the dish in a can!PDC Melting Pot:We actually preferred the melting pot because the taste wasn't as heavy as Duck in a Can and the pot was full of surprises, which made it more interesting. This dish came in a pot which was already hinted with its name! There was pork sausages, shiitake mushrooms, buttery potato cheese which was like mashed potatoes with cheese at the bottom, blood sausage -boudin but it is not like the Asian style one-, pork belly (so yummy!), pork loin and onions. There were a lot of things inside the pot; a lots of surprises! I absolutely loved the "buttery potato cheese", it was so delicious and well-made! The pork was tender and everything in this pot went extremely well with the mashed potatoes! The onion sauce was perfect too! It was a rich dish but not overwhelming like Duck in a Can.We also ordered their Milkshake XXX. My thought of my first sip: this is quite sweet... But afterwards, it got better! I don't know what was inside this milkshake... It tasted like rum (I'm not sure if it contained alcohol though). This was one rich milkshake I would say!We were basically in a food coma after this! I would definitely like to come back again and try their bison tongue (saw good reviews about it!)P.S: Make sure to make a reservation!!! Keep on trying even when their voicemail box is full!Service is outstanding. The employees are so attentive and seem to really love their jobs. Food it also outstanding and some of the best I have had in Montreal. I will say the food is really heavy and I don't want to think about the fat and calories. You'll probably walk out having eaten 2000 calories and well over 50 grams of fat, per person. Then again, if you really care about that stuff, subways right around the corner. Treat yourself, check it out. You will not be disappointed.We came to celebrate my husband's birthday. We reserved via email. It's the easiest way. I highly recommend reserving this way. I do not recommend going on Sunday's. They're out of everything. They were out of a few items. I didn't care for some, but being out of Ribs, Sweetbread, and BEER?! That was very disappointing. I ended up getting the famous Duck in a Can. Great flavour. Very delicious. Duck cooked to perfection. Then the Ragout. I liked the texture and how all the ingredients complimented each other, but it was wayyy too salty. I loved how it was prepared in a cheese block in front of us. Our waitress was rude and short with everything. Uninformative. We felt very rushed by her. Pretty much everything sucked but the Duck in a Can. I will come back and perhaps the experience will be better to tie with the good food.One of the best restaurants I have ever been to (if not the best).I had the duck in a can and my friend the risotto.The risotto is mixed in inside a large parmeggiano cheesw block and the duck is cooked inside the can for 27 minutes to a perfect taste.What an experienceService was great too!!Ouff getting a reservation at au PdeC was not an easy task ... who still operates over voicemail? Especially over a voicemail box that is always full?!But au PdeC still seems to get away with it thanks to all the hype Anthony Bourdain created during his 24 hour Montreal layover (if you've never watched it: dailymotion.com/.../xo2k…...).Needless to say, we had to try it out ourselves or we couldn't be called true Montrealers. But the overwhelming foie gras stuffed courses were too much for two people to handle, so we brought 2 friends for back up! All in all, if you come knowing that this will not be a fine dining experience and that you WILL be overindulging in rich and heavy courses, then your experience will be a satisfying one. And let's be honest, everything just tastes better with fat!From the foie gras stuffed croquettes that just ooze in your mouth as you bite into them, to the decadent poutine topped with foie gras gravy and a whole piece of foie gras and then the squash risotto cooked in a whole wheel of parmesan...! Your reward center will be firing away happy signals for hours to come smile emoticonAll this goodness, paired with a nice bottle of french wine (they have an extensive french heavy wine list and some good beer on tap) made this a highly enjoyable 'tourist in your own city experience'. Good food, good wine and great company along with a surprisingly affordable tab... what's not to like?Heard lots of great reviews for Au Pied de Cochon. This restaurant was featured on one of the shows by Anthony Bourdain! Service was excellent.DRINKS:Pied de Cochon beer x 2TERRAINE OF FOIE GRAS (4/5)Came with jam and bread. So delicious - it's pure foie gras. The taste is very strong and flavourful. A must for foie gras lovers :) I actually enjoyed this dish better without adding the jam on my slice of bread.FOIE GRAS POUTINE (5/5)A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! The closer you are to Montreal, the better the poutine gets and this one is a 5-star poutine for sure! Large slices of foie gras and big chunks of cheese.. mm fatty good!DUCK IN A CAN (5/5)So creative! It's a mini show when the waiter comes over and open the can in front of us (I recorded it all haha). The duck meat was tender and juicy - delicious. I would order this again the next time I visit Au Pied de Cochon.This place is the epitome of French Canadian cuisine. If you want an authentic Canadian culinary experience then this is not to be missed. The food is not for the faint of hearts and definitely leave your vegetarian friends at home. I wouldn't say this is a good everyday-go-to kinda restaurant so come here when you have visitors from out of town or for a special occasion. On to our meal. After cleansing our palettes with foie gras croquettes, we were ready for our main event. We bravely ordered the whole pig's head for two and I can say that it has been one of my most memorable meals. The head of pig was roasted to glistening perfection. Paired with apple and root veggies, the whole plate was full of flavour and tender juicy porky deliciousness. Since they have an open kitchen, people took pictures of our food as it made its way towards our table. It was quite the show! Have to admit I couldn't eat pork for a couple of weeks after but it was definitely worth every bite. Eating at Au Pied is a special event you don't want to miss.Do you love ducks? Or better yet, do you hate ducks? To the point where you'll eat ducks in every form for 3 different dishes? If so, Au Pied de Cochon is just what the doctor ordered.Sure, the name translates to the pig's feet, but the duck is where it's at.Foie gras poutine is about as rich and delicious as it sounds.The duck in a can (which COMES WITH FOIE GRAS) is also a must. Just watching the waiter take a can opener to it and drop it onto a plate is a thing of beauty. The entire can is boiled and then brought out. All the spices are infused and all the fattiness is preserved without getting boiled off. Super unique. Just don't overdo it. One can is probably enough for 3-4 people unless you REALLY want to feel unhealthy.We also got a side of duck fat fries, because WHY THE HELL NOT?There were 8 of us, so we did a few other entrees as well. One was the PDC's cut, which the waiter told us was a boneless pork chop (there was a bone). It looked dry, but it was actually incredibly moist. It was a gigantic hunk of meat too.We also did one of the specials - the Ahi tuna steak for two. Let me tell you, it was NOT for two. Maybe if you fasted and that was the only thing you ate that day. But it was also good. Perfectly rare, with a ton of veggies and cheese on the side. It was probably our least favorite of the dishes, but even still, it was very well done.We were seated all the way in the back by the wine cellar, so it was a bit of a tight squeeze (especially with another large group next to us), but there wasn't much else to complain about. They also have one hell of a wine list.Our waiter was super cool and gave us shots to round out the night.Probably one of the best meals I've ever had. Also, why I came back to the States with none of pants fitting anymore.Make reservations! Either call/email or reserve online. It's a must. Also come hungry, because, they serve a lot of food.This place gets super packed during the dinner rush. Even dining at the counter gets full.I'd recommend the foie gras duo to get the best out of APC. If you're dining with friends, then I'm sure you can taste each other's food. But for a single diner like myself, the foie gras duo comes with Foie Gras burger and foie gras poutine fries. Huge portions for about $50. Very fatty, very rich, and very good.I started off with the tuna tartare as an appetizer, but even though it is a small portion, I couldn't get through my foie gras duo because of the enormity of the portions. The tuna tartare was tarty and fresh.And I still wanted dessert after and I chose the toffee maple milk shake. They made it right in front me...I guess because I was in the counter, but you can see all the fatty goodness when they make this. Not to sweet, but I had enough room to finish it. I would order this again.Trying to find street parking might be hard for you during dinner time. And the metro station is several blocks away. You can probably try the bixi bikes if you have time to roam around this part of the Montreal neighborhood.Drip Drip Drip4 star for food and service but -0.5 star for all the water dripping from the vent on top of my head all through my dinner.Drip Drip Dip I know it was one of the hottest weekend in Montreal.

You can actually hear the staff call out orders.  There are so many options that we probably over ordered for two people!! For starters, we had poutine with foie gras, duck carpaccio and beef tongue.  For entrees we had the duck in a can and the blood sausage tart.  The duck in the can was amazing! We totally over did it on the foie gras but you only live once! We had so much foodWe had to call ahead so the restaurant could accommodate our baby.I went with a southern French person to this restaurant but he did not completely agree with my assessment. Just a caveat. :-)We really wanted to try a Montreal special, as this place is very well known. This place has the famous foie gras poutine and Duck in a Can. We decided to all share to try a few more dishes. The baguette is good!The ambience is nice. We went right when it opened and there was a small line waiting. You cannot get seated if you have not made a reservation. Plan ahead. 1. Garden salad: not on the menu, but we figured we were having so many animal parts this was probably a good idea. $15 for generic salad. The salad was fresh but basic. 2. Mushroom risotto: this dish is very expensive for what it is, but you get a show. They come to your table with a large cheese bowl and add the risotto, mushroom, and even Canadian bacon. This dish had potential but was much too salty. It was hard to finish. 3. Terragon Bison tongue: this is tongue well done. The texture is very soft, which is impressive given the quality of most tongues. The sauces and everything just work well together. However, it's game-y so just be warned. 4. Foie gras poutine: loved it. The fries were good. The gravy was also good. The foie gras was in large blocks and was nice and fatty. I think if you come here, you should get this dish! 5. Duck in a Can: I loved watching them pour half a duck out of a can. Life experience. It even looked nice coming out. The duck came out as a thick filet attached to a flap of lard and also fatty liver (foie gras). I enjoyed this dish very much. It was over puréed cauliflower. The issue I had was that the duck meat was very thick. I had to eat it with slices of the lard to complement the taste. Overall a good dish. 6. Dessert: we got the maple cake and the lemon pie. Both were pretty good. Get the maple cake for novelty sake! Very sweet but good flavors. It was a pricy meal, but for a specialty restaurant it made sense.When my friend and I were certain we wanted to try Au Pied de Cochon, I tried to make reservation (1 week in advance) but their voicemail box was full... I didn't know what to do except, trying to call in the following days... And finally, 2 days before the date we wanted to go, I was finally able to make a reservation (but there weren't any tables left, and the lady asked me if it was okay to be seated at the counter/bar, which I was fine with).Being seated at the counter/bar was actually one exciting experience since we were able to watch the chefs cook and take a glance at all the dishes other customers ordered! It was really mind-blowing watching them cook in a fast-moving environment! I really liked their open-kitchen. It was also fun to guess whether the dish was ours or not too (it was our first time at Au Pied de Cochon, so we didn't know what to expect!)Before coming to Au Pied de Cochon, I searched other people's reviews and made my mind that I wanted to try their Duck in a Can! And this was one of the two dishes we ordered. We didn't know what to order next and my friend thought the The PDC Melting Pot has an interesting name, so we ordered that! Our waiter served us bread and butter (we didn't eat a lot since we wanted to save the tummy for our main courses, but the bread was not too hard, it was perfect!)Duck in a Can: Ordered it like I said because a lot of reviews said it is a must there! It is without doubt an interesting and fun dish. It came in a heated can (like how the name of the dish suggested). So, the waiter brought it over and opened it in front of you, poured the content out of the can (which contains the duck breast, 100g of foie gras, cabbages, the sauce) over the bread with carrot and cauliflower purée. The meat was really tender and it went very well with the cabbage, especially when you eat it with a small piece of duck meat. I actually really like the cabbage! It balanced the richness of the duck meat and foie gras very well. The fat under the duck meat was so chewy (I like chewy stuff) but the other fat part was.... I didn't like it since it was too greasy but some people like the feeling of fat melting in the mouth. We finished the dish (expect for the fat part) since it was too much for us.Duck in a can was quite an experience to be honest, it might not be my favorite dish due to its richness and especially oiliness but it was definitely an unique and interesting experience due to the presentation of the dish in a can!PDC Melting Pot:We actually preferred the melting pot because the taste wasn't as heavy as Duck in a Can and the pot was full of surprises, which made it more interesting. This dish came in a pot which was already hinted with its name! There was pork sausages, shiitake mushrooms, buttery potato cheese which was like mashed potatoes with cheese at the bottom, blood sausage -boudin but it is not like the Asian style one-, pork belly (so yummy!), pork loin and onions. There were a lot of things inside the pot; a lots of surprises! I absolutely loved the "buttery potato cheese", it was so delicious and well-made! The pork was tender and everything in this pot went extremely well with the mashed potatoes! The onion sauce was perfect too! It was a rich dish but not overwhelming like Duck in a Can.We also ordered their Milkshake XXX. My thought of my first sip: this is quite sweet... But afterwards, it got better! I don't know what was inside this milkshake... It tasted like rum (I'm not sure if it contained alcohol though). This was one rich milkshake I would say!We were basically in a food coma after this! I would definitely like to come back again and try their bison tongue (saw good reviews about it!)P.S: Make sure to make a reservation!!! Keep on trying even when their voicemail box is full!Service is outstanding. The employees are so attentive and seem to really love their jobs. Food it also outstanding and some of the best I have had in Montreal. I will say the food is really heavy and I don't want to think about the fat and calories. You'll probably walk out having eaten 2000 calories and well over 50 grams of fat, per person. Then again, if you really care about that stuff, subways right around the corner. Treat yourself, check it out. You will not be disappointed.We came to celebrate my husband's birthday. We reserved via email. It's the easiest way. I highly recommend reserving this way. I do not recommend going on Sunday's. They're out of everything. They were out of a few items. I didn't care for some, but being out of Ribs, Sweetbread, and BEER?! That was very disappointing. I ended up getting the famous Duck in a Can. Great flavour. Very delicious. Duck cooked to perfection. Then the Ragout. I liked the texture and how all the ingredients complimented each other, but it was wayyy too salty. I loved how it was prepared in a cheese block in front of us. Our waitress was rude and short with everything. Uninformative. We felt very rushed by her. Pretty much everything sucked but the Duck in a Can. I will come back and perhaps the experience will be better to tie with the good food.One of the best restaurants I have ever been to (if not the best).I had the duck in a can and my friend the risotto.The risotto is mixed in inside a large parmeggiano cheesw block and the duck is cooked inside the can for 27 minutes to a perfect taste.What an experienceService was great too!!Ouff getting a reservation at au PdeC was not an easy task ... who still operates over voicemail? Especially over a voicemail box that is always full?!But au PdeC still seems to get away with it thanks to all the hype Anthony Bourdain created during his 24 hour Montreal layover (if you've never watched it: dailymotion.com/.../xo2k…...).Needless to say, we had to try it out ourselves or we couldn't be called true Montrealers. But the overwhelming foie gras stuffed courses were too much for two people to handle, so we brought 2 friends for back up! All in all, if you come knowing that this will not be a fine dining experience and that you WILL be overindulging in rich and heavy courses, then your experience will be a satisfying one. And let's be honest, everything just tastes better with fat!From the foie gras stuffed croquettes that just ooze in your mouth as you bite into them, to the decadent poutine topped with foie gras gravy and a whole piece of foie gras and then the squash risotto cooked in a whole wheel of parmesan...! Your reward center will be firing away happy signals for hours to come smile emoticonAll this goodness, paired with a nice bottle of french wine (they have an extensive french heavy wine list and some good beer on tap) made this a highly enjoyable 'tourist in your own city experience'. Good food, good wine and great company along with a surprisingly affordable tab... what's not to like?Heard lots of great reviews for Au Pied de Cochon. This restaurant was featured on one of the shows by Anthony Bourdain! Service was excellent.DRINKS:Pied de Cochon beer x 2TERRAINE OF FOIE GRAS (4/5)Came with jam and bread. So delicious - it's pure foie gras. The taste is very strong and flavourful. A must for foie gras lovers :) I actually enjoyed this dish better without adding the jam on my slice of bread.FOIE GRAS POUTINE (5/5)A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! The closer you are to Montreal, the better the poutine gets and this one is a 5-star poutine for sure! Large slices of foie gras and big chunks of cheese.. mm fatty good!DUCK IN A CAN (5/5)So creative! It's a mini show when the waiter comes over and open the can in front of us (I recorded it all haha). The duck meat was tender and juicy - delicious. I would order this again the next time I visit Au Pied de Cochon.This place is the epitome of French Canadian cuisine. If you want an authentic Canadian culinary experience then this is not to be missed. The food is not for the faint of hearts and definitely leave your vegetarian friends at home. I wouldn't say this is a good everyday-go-to kinda restaurant so come here when you have visitors from out of town or for a special occasion. On to our meal. After cleansing our palettes with foie gras croquettes, we were ready for our main event. We bravely ordered the whole pig's head for two and I can say that it has been one of my most memorable meals. The head of pig was roasted to glistening perfection. Paired with apple and root veggies, the whole plate was full of flavour and tender juicy porky deliciousness. Since they have an open kitchen, people took pictures of our food as it made its way towards our table. It was quite the show! Have to admit I couldn't eat pork for a couple of weeks after but it was definitely worth every bite. Eating at Au Pied is a special event you don't want to miss.Do you love ducks? Or better yet, do you hate ducks? To the point where you'll eat ducks in every form for 3 different dishes? If so, Au Pied de Cochon is just what the doctor ordered.Sure, the name translates to the pig's feet, but the duck is where it's at.Foie gras poutine is about as rich and delicious as it sounds.The duck in a can (which COMES WITH FOIE GRAS) is also a must. Just watching the waiter take a can opener to it and drop it onto a plate is a thing of beauty. The entire can is boiled and then brought out. All the spices are infused and all the fattiness is preserved without getting boiled off. Super unique. Just don't overdo it. One can is probably enough for 3-4 people unless you REALLY want to feel unhealthy.We also got a side of duck fat fries, because WHY THE HELL NOT?There were 8 of us, so we did a few other entrees as well. One was the PDC's cut, which the waiter told us was a boneless pork chop (there was a bone). It looked dry, but it was actually incredibly moist. It was a gigantic hunk of meat too.We also did one of the specials - the Ahi tuna steak for two. Let me tell you, it was NOT for two. Maybe if you fasted and that was the only thing you ate that day. But it was also good. Perfectly rare, with a ton of veggies and cheese on the side. It was probably our least favorite of the dishes, but even still, it was very well done.We were seated all the way in the back by the wine cellar, so it was a bit of a tight squeeze (especially with another large group next to us), but there wasn't much else to complain about. They also have one hell of a wine list.Our waiter was super cool and gave us shots to round out the night.Probably one of the best meals I've ever had. Also, why I came back to the States with none of pants fitting anymore.Make reservations! Either call/email or reserve online. It's a must. Also come hungry, because, they serve a lot of food.This place gets super packed during the dinner rush. Even dining at the counter gets full.I'd recommend the foie gras duo to get the best out of APC. If you're dining with friends, then I'm sure you can taste each other's food. But for a single diner like myself, the foie gras duo comes with Foie Gras burger and foie gras poutine fries. Huge portions for about $50. Very fatty, very rich, and very good.I started off with the tuna tartare as an appetizer, but even though it is a small portion, I couldn't get through my foie gras duo because of the enormity of the portions. The tuna tartare was tarty and fresh.And I still wanted dessert after and I chose the toffee maple milk shake. They made it right in front me...I guess because I was in the counter, but you can see all the fatty goodness when they make this. Not to sweet, but I had enough room to finish it. I would order this again.Trying to find street parking might be hard for you during dinner time. And the metro station is several blocks away. You can probably try the bixi bikes if you have time to roam around this part of the Montreal neighborhood.Drip Drip Drip4 star for food and service but -0.5 star for all the water dripping from the vent on top of my head all through my dinner.Drip Drip Dip I know it was one of the hottest weekend in Montreal. It was end of July after all and I should be thankful for the nice cool interior of the restaurant with their AC on full blast. But with the water dripping on me the whole time (2 hour) while I was enjoying my dinner was not cool. The staff was all trying their best to stop the dripping from top of the AC vent which ran across the full depth of the restaurant by a squeegee sponge but it was not working....Drip Drip DripDinner was really good!! Excellent!We shared Tarragon Bison Tongue ($8.50) - I just love the Cornichon in that! And now I have a bottle in my fridge at home!Pâté de Campagne ($9) - So smooth and rich!Duck Carpaccio ($14) - Well seasoned, my first time having duck carpaccioDuck in a Can ($44) - So overhyped! The duck was dry and just not good! Foie Gras was so so. I don't believe I said that but I preferred mine seared...Braised Pig Feet with Side Pasta ($50) Seasonal - Must Order!! It was so tender and flavoured!! And the pasta which was prepared table side was so good! Perfect al dente and with BACON... Drip Drip DripI would have up my star to a 4 because the food was just amazing and the service was excellent. But the management really need to do something about their cooling system. I definitely would be back! PS The reservation system just got so much better as my reservation was confirmed by email and no need to play phone tag again!We had the foie gras poutine, stuffed pied de cochon with foie gras and a tuna dish. All were very rich in flavor and will lead to a heart attack BUT worth every bite. Poutine- get it! after all it is a Canadian dishStuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras- this is large enough for 3-4 people to share, the best part about this dish was the MASHED POTATO, it is sooooooooo good! it has a different texture from the typical mushy mashed potato. Tuna dish- our waiter picked this for us so I don't know what it's called but it's a pretty good dish with gravy and mashed potato on the bottom but it was a little salty though. Overall, amazing FATTY French Canadian food.Very rich food. If you like your food too creamy or too buttery, then this is your type of food. Everything was just very heavy and I couldn't seem to finish the dish. The FG is actually not bad as this was my first time tasting it. Definitely not something I would typically eat but at least I tried it! Plogue Champlain $29Pork filet $30Fg hamburger $39Squash risotto $24Fg poutine $24Eel tart $14The place was jam packed and there's absolutely no room to move if you're sitting on the outside of the table. Service is slow because of how busy it is. Might take you 10min to get the attention of a waitress and another 10 for the bill. Overall definitely a place to try but not something I would do again as its not really my type of food fare.I am judging overall as a meal and the service. First off, the place doesnt have a banner so it is difficult to spot if you dont know where it is. Foie gras poutine. Very good, the foie gras melted in with the poutine and you were able to taste the foie gras. The texture or the plate was consistant, there was cheesy, crispy and then the foie gras made it very good. you were able to taste that the fries were fried in the duck fat and the gravy was creamy and rich. with that being said, a very good dish but will get heavy and sickening after you eat too much of it.Foie gras a la champlain. foie gras on top of a thick slice of bacon, on a bed of thin crispy potato pancake (like a thin hashbrown), topped with a generous amount of maple syrup sauce. First bite was veryyyyy good!! So cripsy from the potato, the bacon was thick and the foie gras was enhanced in this plate, the maple syrup sauce was a good amount of sweet and salty. But this is definitely not a plate you eat on your own, its best for sharing because after a while the taste and maple syrup is quite overwhelming. table side Squash risotto. risotto was cooked very well but since it was table side she made it in the a large parmesan cheese, mixed it all together. She over poured the chicken broth and the risotto became a soup. The waiter asked how it was and I told him honestly that I did not like it because it was too watery. He left then about 3-4 mins later he asked me "do you want me to take it to the chef to try it", well no obviously not! She should have known when she served it because it was clearly too watery. He knew I was unhappy and he was the one that was pushing for this squash risotto, he didnt do anything to make up for the bad dish. At a resto like that I would expect so much more. Overall, theres definitely better. I'm glad I tried it but I would not be returning.We made the reservation two weeks ago. Probably because it's weekday, we are the only customers at 5:00pm.We didn't drink alcohol, only a bottle of water. The water is in glass bottle, taste better than thesame brand in plastic bottle.Tarragon Bison Tongue is the first dish. The tongue is from beef. Mr. Tang said it's good. I prefer the pickle, since I didn't try the tongue.Catch of the day, we picked the smoked eel. It also served with a piece of veal bone, you can eat the marrow(not sure if it's this word...).Fg poutine is great, although foie gras is too greasy for me.The duck in a can is great too. The duck is juicy and fresh, also with blood. The veggie taste a bit sour, really savory.The one missing star is for the dessert. Both icecream and pecan pie are too sweet for me to enjoy.After much hype, I made it here with a few colleagues on a Wednesday evening. The place was absolutely hopping and hard to get into, but we made a reservation a few weeks in advance.Once inside we sat at the bar, which is by far the best seat in the house. It comes with a direct view of the kitchen and all the goodness the chefs are whipping up. We started out with the ham special for appetizer, which was delicious. It came with a baguette and butter which made it perfect. We then had some poutine, which was also quite good. It was definitely better quality than most poutine dishes. For the main course, I went aggressive and got a mixed bowl consisting of blood sausage, pork sausage, mushrooms and onions sitting on top of mashed potatoes. The dish was very good, but not the amazing experience I was hoping for. Spices could have been a little better, but make no mistake it was a very good dish.With its popular reputation, upbeat atmosphere and good food, this is definitely a place worth visiting when in town. They also have a really good bar with interesting drinks. Great overall experience.Delicious food and a must if you're in Montreal. Come in hungry bc you'll get a rich and hearty meal. We ordered the infamous duck in a can, mushroom tortellini (tonites special), the steamed dumplings & plogue a Champlain "foie gras breakfast" - which was the highlight of the night. buckwheat pancake,  thick Canadian bacon, potatoes and cheese topped with foie gras. I wish it was one of the earlier items delivered I would have enjoyed a few more bites. Would def come here with a group to be able to taste more items on the menu. It's a busy restaurant so do make reservations. We scored 9:30 pm reservations on a Sunday night and place was packed with ppl still coming in with reservations after us. Service was slow and we had a really long wait b/t entrees coming out. We didn't leave until after 11:30. Luckily for us, our toddler was still on California time and was cooperative.Visit Montreal for a weekend and made a reservation two weeks in advance. Not too hard: I left a voicemail and someone called me back the next day. Between my friend and I, we ordered:- cromesquis de foie gras, basically deep fried fg. For $4, it was worth it. - temaki tartare, tartare Japanese hand roll. They didn't have bison available and we were offered veal. I quite enjoyed the layers of flavour and texture. - carpaccio de canard, duck carpaccio. My second favorite of the night. - and finally, poutine au foie gras. I hate to say it but this was a bit of a disappointment. I'm a fan of fg but this didn't have the ah-ha for me. We went later in the evening and 2 of the 3 cocktails were already sold out. My reco would be to go early. We also had a lot of trouble finding this place late at night. You really have to know what the front looks like!If you love pork and foie gras, this place is heaven. Recommend getting the foie gras poutine and the duck in a can. We also ordered the onion soup, duck carpaccio and the dumplings.Onion soup - your standard cheesy onion soup done right. Super tasty. Foie gras Poutine - must get!! Abundance of extra buttery and fatty foie gras with fries and gravy. This is a heavy dish so great for sharing and having a cold beer. Duck carpaccio - the presentation of the dish was beautiful. Thinly slice duck with chives, raw mushrooms and a yolk. Duck in a can - must get as well! The waiter brings over the can and opens it in front of the table. The content of the can contains the small duck, foie gras, cabbage which is all poured over the bread with carrot purée. The meat was tender and succulent.The service was very good - our waiter was extremely nice and helpful in making suggestions. There are so many options to choose from so it's great if you come with a big group and share everything!This place is insanely delicious.  The restaurant is a bit tight on space but the kitchen is opened.

The duck came out as a thick filet attached to a flap of lard and also fatty liver (foie gras). I enjoyed this dish very much. It was over puréed cauliflower.

A must for foie gras lovers :) I actually enjoyed this dish better without adding the jam on my slice of bread.FOIE GRAS POUTINE (5/5)A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! The closer you are to Montreal, the better the poutine gets and this one is a 5-star poutine for sure! Large slices of foie gras and big chunks of cheese.. mm fatty good!DUCK IN A CAN (5/5)So creative! It's a mini show when the waiter comes over and open the can in front of us (I recorded it all haha). The duck meat was tender and juicy - delicious. I would order this again the next time I visit Au Pied de Cochon.This place is the epitome of French Canadian cuisine. If you want an authentic Canadian culinary experience then this is not to be missed. The food is not for the faint of hearts and definitely leave your vegetarian friends at home. I wouldn't say this is a good everyday-go-to kinda restaurant so come here when you have visitors from out of town or for a special occasion. On to our meal. After cleansing our palettes with foie gras croquettes, we were ready for our main event. We bravely ordered the whole pig's head for two and I can say that it has been one of my most memorable meals. The head of pig was roasted to glistening perfection. Paired with apple and root veggies, the whole plate was full of flavour and tender juicy porky deliciousness. Since they have an open kitchen, people took pictures of our food as it made its way towards our table. It was quite the show! Have to admit I couldn't eat pork for a couple of weeks after but it was definitely worth every bite. Eating at Au Pied is a special event you don't want to miss.Do you love ducks? Or better yet, do you hate ducks? To the point where you'll eat ducks in every form for 3 different dishes? If so, Au Pied de Cochon is just what the doctor ordered.Sure, the name translates to the pig's feet, but the duck is where it's at.Foie gras poutine is about as rich and delicious as it sounds.The duck in a can (which COMES WITH FOIE GRAS) is also a must. Just watching the waiter take a can opener to it and drop it onto a plate is a thing of beauty. The entire can is boiled and then brought out. All the spices are infused and all the fattiness is preserved without getting boiled off. Super unique. Just don't overdo it. One can is probably enough for 3-4 people unless you REALLY want to feel unhealthy.We also got a side of duck fat fries, because WHY THE HELL NOT?There were 8 of us, so we did a few other entrees as well. One was the PDC's cut, which the waiter told us was a boneless pork chop (there was a bone). It looked dry, but it was actually incredibly moist. It was a gigantic hunk of meat too.We also did one of the specials - the Ahi tuna steak for two. Let me tell you, it was NOT for two. Maybe if you fasted and that was the only thing you ate that day. But it was also good. Perfectly rare, with a ton of veggies and cheese on the side. It was probably our least favorite of the dishes, but even still, it was very well done.We were seated all the way in the back by the wine cellar, so it was a bit of a tight squeeze (especially with another large group next to us), but there wasn't much else to complain about. They also have one hell of a wine list.Our waiter was super cool and gave us shots to round out the night.Probably one of the best meals I've ever had. Also, why I came back to the States with none of pants fitting anymore.Make reservations! Either call/email or reserve online. It's a must. Also come hungry, because, they serve a lot of food.This place gets super packed during the dinner rush. Even dining at the counter gets full.I'd recommend the foie gras duo to get the best out of APC. If you're dining with friends, then I'm sure you can taste each other's food. But for a single diner like myself, the foie gras duo comes with Foie Gras burger and foie gras poutine fries. Huge portions for about $50. Very fatty, very rich, and very good.I started off with the tuna tartare as an appetizer, but even though it is a small portion, I couldn't get through my foie gras duo because of the enormity of the portions. The tuna tartare was tarty and fresh.And I still wanted dessert after and I chose the toffee maple milk shake. They made it right in front me...I guess because I was in the counter, but you can see all the fatty goodness when they make this. Not to sweet, but I had enough room to finish it. I would order this again.Trying to find street parking might be hard for you during dinner time. And the metro station is several blocks away. You can probably try the bixi bikes if you have time to roam around this part of the Montreal neighborhood.Drip Drip Drip4 star for food and service but -0.5 star for all the water dripping from the vent on top of my head all through my dinner.Drip Drip Dip I know it was one of the hottest weekend in Montreal. It was end of July after all and I should be thankful for the nice cool interior of the restaurant with their AC on full blast. But with the water dripping on me the whole time (2 hour) while I was enjoying my dinner was not cool. The staff was all trying their best to stop the dripping from top of the AC vent which ran across the full depth of the restaurant by a squeegee sponge but it was not working....Drip Drip DripDinner was really good!! Excellent!We shared Tarragon Bison Tongue ($8.50) - I just love the Cornichon in that! And now I have a bottle in my fridge at home!Pâté de Campagne ($9) - So smooth and rich!Duck Carpaccio ($14) - Well seasoned, my first time having duck carpaccioDuck in a Can ($44) - So overhyped! The duck was dry and just not good! Foie Gras was so so. I don't believe I said that but I preferred mine seared...Braised Pig Feet with Side Pasta ($50) Seasonal - Must Order!! It was so tender and flavoured!! And the pasta which was prepared table side was so good! Perfect al dente and with BACON... Drip Drip DripI would have up my star to a 4 because the food was just amazing and the service was excellent. But the management really need to do something about their cooling system. I definitely would be back! PS The reservation system just got so much better as my reservation was confirmed by email and no need to play phone tag again!We had the foie gras poutine, stuffed pied de cochon with foie gras and a tuna dish. All were very rich in flavor and will lead to a heart attack BUT worth every bite. Poutine- get it! after all it is a Canadian dishStuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras- this is large enough for 3-4 people to share, the best part about this dish was the MASHED POTATO, it is sooooooooo good! it has a different texture from the typical mushy mashed potato. Tuna dish- our waiter picked this for us so I don't know what it's called but it's a pretty good dish with gravy and mashed potato on the bottom but it was a little salty though. Overall, amazing FATTY French Canadian food.Very rich food. If you like your food too creamy or too buttery, then this is your type of food. Everything was just very heavy and I couldn't seem to finish the dish. The FG is actually not bad as this was my first time tasting it. Definitely not something I would typically eat but at least I tried it! Plogue Champlain $29Pork filet $30Fg hamburger $39Squash risotto $24Fg poutine $24Eel tart $14The place was jam packed and there's absolutely no room to move if you're sitting on the outside of the table. Service is slow because of how busy it is. Might take you 10min to get the attention of a waitress and another 10 for the bill. Overall definitely a place to try but not something I would do again as its not really my type of food fare.I am judging overall as a meal and the service. First off, the place doesnt have a banner so it is difficult to spot if you dont know where it is. Foie gras poutine. Very good, the foie gras melted in with the poutine and you were able to taste the foie gras. The texture or the plate was consistant, there was cheesy, crispy and then the foie gras made it very good. you were able to taste that the fries were fried in the duck fat and the gravy was creamy and rich. with that being said, a very good dish but will get heavy and sickening after you eat too much of it.Foie gras a la champlain. foie gras on top of a thick slice of bacon, on a bed of thin crispy potato pancake (like a thin hashbrown), topped with a generous amount of maple syrup sauce. First bite was veryyyyy good!! So cripsy from the potato, the bacon was thick and the foie gras was enhanced in this plate, the maple syrup sauce was a good amount of sweet and salty. But this is definitely not a plate you eat on your own, its best for sharing because after a while the taste and maple syrup is quite overwhelming. table side Squash risotto. risotto was cooked very well but since it was table side she made it in the a large parmesan cheese, mixed it all together. She over poured the chicken broth and the risotto became a soup. The waiter asked how it was and I told him honestly that I did not like it because it was too watery. He left then about 3-4 mins later he asked me "do you want me to take it to the chef to try it", well no obviously not! She should have known when she served it because it was clearly too watery. He knew I was unhappy and he was the one that was pushing for this squash risotto, he didnt do anything to make up for the bad dish. At a resto like that I would expect so much more. Overall, theres definitely better. I'm glad I tried it but I would not be returning.We made the reservation two weeks ago. Probably because it's weekday, we are the only customers at 5:00pm.We didn't drink alcohol, only a bottle of water. The water is in glass bottle, taste better than thesame brand in plastic bottle.Tarragon Bison Tongue is the first dish. The tongue is from beef. Mr. Tang said it's good. I prefer the pickle, since I didn't try the tongue.Catch of the day, we picked the smoked eel. It also served with a piece of veal bone, you can eat the marrow(not sure if it's this word...).Fg poutine is great, although foie gras is too greasy for me.The duck in a can is great too. The duck is juicy and fresh, also with blood. The veggie taste a bit sour, really savory.The one missing star is for the dessert. Both icecream and pecan pie are too sweet for me to enjoy.After much hype, I made it here with a few colleagues on a Wednesday evening. The place was absolutely hopping and hard to get into, but we made a reservation a few weeks in advance.Once inside we sat at the bar, which is by far the best seat in the house. It comes with a direct view of the kitchen and all the goodness the chefs are whipping up. We started out with the ham special for appetizer, which was delicious. It came with a baguette and butter which made it perfect. We then had some poutine, which was also quite good. It was definitely better quality than most poutine dishes. For the main course, I went aggressive and got a mixed bowl consisting of blood sausage, pork sausage, mushrooms and onions sitting on top of mashed potatoes. The dish was very good, but not the amazing experience I was hoping for. Spices could have been a little better, but make no mistake it was a very good dish.With its popular reputation, upbeat atmosphere and good food, this is definitely a place worth visiting when in town. They also have a really good bar with interesting drinks. Great overall experience.Delicious food and a must if you're in Montreal. Come in hungry bc you'll get a rich and hearty meal. We ordered the infamous duck in a can, mushroom tortellini (tonites special), the steamed dumplings & plogue a Champlain "foie gras breakfast" - which was the highlight of the night. buckwheat pancake,  thick Canadian bacon, potatoes and cheese topped with foie gras. I wish it was one of the earlier items delivered I would have enjoyed a few more bites. Would def come here with a group to be able to taste more items on the menu. It's a busy restaurant so do make reservations. We scored 9:30 pm reservations on a Sunday night and place was packed with ppl still coming in with reservations after us. Service was slow and we had a really long wait b/t entrees coming out. We didn't leave until after 11:30. Luckily for us, our toddler was still on California time and was cooperative.Visit Montreal for a weekend and made a reservation two weeks in advance. Not too hard: I left a voicemail and someone called me back the next day. Between my friend and I, we ordered:- cromesquis de foie gras, basically deep fried fg. For $4, it was worth it. - temaki tartare, tartare Japanese hand roll. They didn't have bison available and we were offered veal. I quite enjoyed the layers of flavour and texture. - carpaccio de canard, duck carpaccio. My second favorite of the night. - and finally, poutine au foie gras. I hate to say it but this was a bit of a disappointment. I'm a fan of fg but this didn't have the ah-ha for me. We went later in the evening and 2 of the 3 cocktails were already sold out. My reco would be to go early. We also had a lot of trouble finding this place late at night. You really have to know what the front looks like!If you love pork and foie gras, this place is heaven. Recommend getting the foie gras poutine and the duck in a can. We also ordered the onion soup, duck carpaccio and the dumplings.Onion soup - your standard cheesy onion soup done right. Super tasty. Foie gras Poutine - must get!! Abundance of extra buttery and fatty foie gras with fries and gravy. This is a heavy dish so great for sharing and having a cold beer. Duck carpaccio - the presentation of the dish was beautiful. Thinly slice duck with chives, raw mushrooms and a yolk. Duck in a can - must get as well! The waiter brings over the can and opens it in front of the table. The content of the can contains the small duck, foie gras, cabbage which is all poured over the bread with carrot purée. The meat was tender and succulent.The service was very good - our waiter was extremely nice and helpful in making suggestions. There are so many options to choose from so it's great if you come with a big group and share everything!This place is insanely delicious.  The restaurant is a bit tight on space but the kitchen is opened. You can actually hear the staff call out orders.  There are so many options that we probably over ordered for two people!! For starters, we had poutine with foie gras, duck carpaccio and beef tongue.  For entrees we had the duck in a can and the blood sausage tart.  The duck in the can was amazing! We totally over did it on the foie gras but you only live once! We had so much foodWe had to call ahead so the restaurant could accommodate our baby.I went with a southern French person to this restaurant but he did not completely agree with my assessment. Just a caveat. :-)We really wanted to try a Montreal special, as this place is very well known. This place has the famous foie gras poutine and Duck in a Can. We decided to all share to try a few more dishes. The baguette is good!The ambience is nice. We went right when it opened and there was a small line waiting. You cannot get seated if you have not made a reservation. Plan ahead. 1. Garden salad: not on the menu, but we figured we were having so many animal parts this was probably a good idea. $15 for generic salad. The salad was fresh but basic. 2. Mushroom risotto: this dish is very expensive for what it is, but you get a show. They come to your table with a large cheese bowl and add the risotto, mushroom, and even Canadian bacon. This dish had potential but was much too salty. It was hard to finish. 3. Terragon Bison tongue: this is tongue well done. The texture is very soft, which is impressive given the quality of most tongues. The sauces and everything just work well together. However, it's game-y so just be warned. 4. Foie gras poutine: loved it. The fries were good. The gravy was also good. The foie gras was in large blocks and was nice and fatty. I think if you come here, you should get this dish! 5. Duck in a Can: I loved watching them pour half a duck out of a can. Life experience. It even looked nice coming out. The duck came out as a thick filet attached to a flap of lard and also fatty liver (foie gras). I enjoyed this dish very much. It was over puréed cauliflower. The issue I had was that the duck meat was very thick. I had to eat it with slices of the lard to complement the taste. Overall a good dish. 6. Dessert: we got the maple cake and the lemon pie. Both were pretty good. Get the maple cake for novelty sake! Very sweet but good flavors. It was a pricy meal, but for a specialty restaurant it made sense.When my friend and I were certain we wanted to try Au Pied de Cochon, I tried to make reservation (1 week in advance) but their voicemail box was full... I didn't know what to do except, trying to call in the following days... And finally, 2 days before the date we wanted to go, I was finally able to make a reservation (but there weren't any tables left, and the lady asked me if it was okay to be seated at the counter/bar, which I was fine with).Being seated at the counter/bar was actually one exciting experience since we were able to watch the chefs cook and take a glance at all the dishes other customers ordered! It was really mind-blowing watching them cook in a fast-moving environment! I really liked their open-kitchen. It was also fun to guess whether the dish was ours or not too (it was our first time at Au Pied de Cochon, so we didn't know what to expect!)Before coming to Au Pied de Cochon, I searched other people's reviews and made my mind that I wanted to try their Duck in a Can! And this was one of the two dishes we ordered. We didn't know what to order next and my friend thought the The PDC Melting Pot has an interesting name, so we ordered that! Our waiter served us bread and butter (we didn't eat a lot since we wanted to save the tummy for our main courses, but the bread was not too hard, it was perfect!)Duck in a Can: Ordered it like I said because a lot of reviews said it is a must there! It is without doubt an interesting and fun dish. It came in a heated can (like how the name of the dish suggested). So, the waiter brought it over and opened it in front of you, poured the content out of the can (which contains the duck breast, 100g of foie gras, cabbages, the sauce) over the bread with carrot and cauliflower purée. The meat was really tender and it went very well with the cabbage, especially when you eat it with a small piece of duck meat. I actually really like the cabbage! It balanced the richness of the duck meat and foie gras very well. The fat under the duck meat was so chewy (I like chewy stuff) but the other fat part was.... I didn't like it since it was too greasy but some people like the feeling of fat melting in the mouth. We finished the dish (expect for the fat part) since it was too much for us.Duck in a can was quite an experience to be honest, it might not be my favorite dish due to its richness and especially oiliness but it was definitely an unique and interesting experience due to the presentation of the dish in a can!PDC Melting Pot:We actually preferred the melting pot because the taste wasn't as heavy as Duck in a Can and the pot was full of surprises, which made it more interesting. This dish came in a pot which was already hinted with its name! There was pork sausages, shiitake mushrooms, buttery potato cheese which was like mashed potatoes with cheese at the bottom, blood sausage -boudin but it is not like the Asian style one-, pork belly (so yummy!), pork loin and onions. There were a lot of things inside the pot; a lots of surprises! I absolutely loved the "buttery potato cheese", it was so delicious and well-made! The pork was tender and everything in this pot went extremely well with the mashed potatoes! The onion sauce was perfect too! It was a rich dish but not overwhelming like Duck in a Can.We also ordered their Milkshake XXX. My thought of my first sip: this is quite sweet... But afterwards, it got better! I don't know what was inside this milkshake... It tasted like rum (I'm not sure if it contained alcohol though). This was one rich milkshake I would say!We were basically in a food coma after this! I would definitely like to come back again and try their bison tongue (saw good reviews about it!)P.S: Make sure to make a reservation!!! Keep on trying even when their voicemail box is full!Service is outstanding. The employees are so attentive and seem to really love their jobs. Food it also outstanding and some of the best I have had in Montreal. I will say the food is really heavy and I don't want to think about the fat and calories. You'll probably walk out having eaten 2000 calories and well over 50 grams of fat, per person. Then again, if you really care about that stuff, subways right around the corner. Treat yourself, check it out. You will not be disappointed.We came to celebrate my husband's birthday. We reserved via email. It's the easiest way. I highly recommend reserving this way. I do not recommend going on Sunday's. They're out of everything. They were out of a few items. I didn't care for some, but being out of Ribs, Sweetbread, and BEER?! That was very disappointing. I ended up getting the famous Duck in a Can. Great flavour. Very delicious. Duck cooked to perfection. Then the Ragout. I liked the texture and how all the ingredients complimented each other, but it was wayyy too salty. I loved how it was prepared in a cheese block in front of us. Our waitress was rude and short with everything. Uninformative. We felt very rushed by her. Pretty much everything sucked but the Duck in a Can. I will come back and perhaps the experience will be better to tie with the good food.One of the best restaurants I have ever been to (if not the best).I had the duck in a can and my friend the risotto.The risotto is mixed in inside a large parmeggiano cheesw block and the duck is cooked inside the can for 27 minutes to a perfect taste.What an experienceService was great too!!Ouff getting a reservation at au PdeC was not an easy task ... who still operates over voicemail? Especially over a voicemail box that is always full?!But au PdeC still seems to get away with it thanks to all the hype Anthony Bourdain created during his 24 hour Montreal layover (if you've never watched it: dailymotion.com/.../xo2k…...).Needless to say, we had to try it out ourselves or we couldn't be called true Montrealers. But the overwhelming foie gras stuffed courses were too much for two people to handle, so we brought 2 friends for back up! All in all, if you come knowing that this will not be a fine dining experience and that you WILL be overindulging in rich and heavy courses, then your experience will be a satisfying one. And let's be honest, everything just tastes better with fat!From the foie gras stuffed croquettes that just ooze in your mouth as you bite into them, to the decadent poutine topped with foie gras gravy and a whole piece of foie gras and then the squash risotto cooked in a whole wheel of parmesan...! Your reward center will be firing away happy signals for hours to come smile emoticonAll this goodness, paired with a nice bottle of french wine (they have an extensive french heavy wine list and some good beer on tap) made this a highly enjoyable 'tourist in your own city experience'. Good food, good wine and great company along with a surprisingly affordable tab... what's not to like?Heard lots of great reviews for Au Pied de Cochon. This restaurant was featured on one of the shows by Anthony Bourdain! Service was excellent.DRINKS:Pied de Cochon beer x 2TERRAINE OF FOIE GRAS (4/5)Came with jam and bread.

He knew I was unhappy and he was the one that was pushing for this squash risotto, he didnt do anything to make up for the bad dish. At a resto like that I would expect so much more. Overall, theres definitely better. I'm glad I tried it but I would not be returning.We made the reservation two weeks ago. Probably because it's weekday, we are the only customers at 5:00pm.We didn't drink alcohol, only a bottle of water. The water is in glass bottle, taste better than thesame brand in plastic bottle.Tarragon Bison Tongue is the first dish. The tongue is from beef. Mr. Tang said it's good. I prefer the pickle, since I didn't try the tongue.Catch of the day, we picked the smoked eel. It also served with a piece of veal bone, you can eat the marrow(not sure if it's this word...).Fg poutine is great, although foie gras is too greasy for me.The duck in a can is great too. The duck is juicy and fresh, also with blood. The veggie taste a bit sour, really savory.The one missing star is for the dessert. Both icecream and pecan pie are too sweet for me to enjoy.After much hype, I made it here with a few colleagues on a Wednesday evening. The place was absolutely hopping and hard to get into, but we made a reservation a few weeks in advance.Once inside we sat at the bar, which is by far the best seat in the house. It comes with a direct view of the kitchen and all the goodness the chefs are whipping up. We started out with the ham special for appetizer, which was delicious. It came with a baguette and butter which made it perfect. We then had some poutine, which was also quite good. It was definitely better quality than most poutine dishes. For the main course, I went aggressive and got a mixed bowl consisting of blood sausage, pork sausage, mushrooms and onions sitting on top of mashed potatoes. The dish was very good, but not the amazing experience I was hoping for. Spices could have been a little better, but make no mistake it was a very good dish.With its popular reputation, upbeat atmosphere and good food, this is definitely a place worth visiting when in town. They also have a really good bar with interesting drinks. Great overall experience.Delicious food and a must if you're in Montreal. Come in hungry bc you'll get a rich and hearty meal. We ordered the infamous duck in a can, mushroom tortellini (tonites special), the steamed dumplings & plogue a Champlain "foie gras breakfast" - which was the highlight of the night. buckwheat pancake,  thick Canadian bacon, potatoes and cheese topped with foie gras. I wish it was one of the earlier items delivered I would have enjoyed a few more bites. Would def come here with a group to be able to taste more items on the menu. It's a busy restaurant so do make reservations. We scored 9:30 pm reservations on a Sunday night and place was packed with ppl still coming in with reservations after us. Service was slow and we had a really long wait b/t entrees coming out. We didn't leave until after 11:30. Luckily for us, our toddler was still on California time and was cooperative.Visit Montreal for a weekend and made a reservation two weeks in advance. Not too hard: I left a voicemail and someone called me back the next day. Between my friend and I, we ordered:- cromesquis de foie gras, basically deep fried fg. For $4, it was worth it. - temaki tartare, tartare Japanese hand roll. They didn't have bison available and we were offered veal. I quite enjoyed the layers of flavour and texture. - carpaccio de canard, duck carpaccio. My second favorite of the night. - and finally, poutine au foie gras. I hate to say it but this was a bit of a disappointment. I'm a fan of fg but this didn't have the ah-ha for me. We went later in the evening and 2 of the 3 cocktails were already sold out. My reco would be to go early. We also had a lot of trouble finding this place late at night. You really have to know what the front looks like!If you love pork and foie gras, this place is heaven. Recommend getting the foie gras poutine and the duck in a can. We also ordered the onion soup, duck carpaccio and the dumplings.Onion soup - your standard cheesy onion soup done right. Super tasty. Foie gras Poutine - must get!! Abundance of extra buttery and fatty foie gras with fries and gravy. This is a heavy dish so great for sharing and having a cold beer. Duck carpaccio - the presentation of the dish was beautiful. Thinly slice duck with chives, raw mushrooms and a yolk. Duck in a can - must get as well! The waiter brings over the can and opens it in front of the table. The content of the can contains the small duck, foie gras, cabbage which is all poured over the bread with carrot purée. The meat was tender and succulent.The service was very good - our waiter was extremely nice and helpful in making suggestions. There are so many options to choose from so it's great if you come with a big group and share everything!This place is insanely delicious.  The restaurant is a bit tight on space but the kitchen is opened. You can actually hear the staff call out orders.  There are so many options that we probably over ordered for two people!! For starters, we had poutine with foie gras, duck carpaccio and beef tongue.  For entrees we had the duck in a can and the blood sausage tart.  The duck in the can was amazing! We totally over did it on the foie gras but you only live once! We had so much foodWe had to call ahead so the restaurant could accommodate our baby.I went with a southern French person to this restaurant but he did not completely agree with my assessment. Just a caveat. :-)We really wanted to try a Montreal special, as this place is very well known. This place has the famous foie gras poutine and Duck in a Can. We decided to all share to try a few more dishes. The baguette is good!The ambience is nice. We went right when it opened and there was a small line waiting. You cannot get seated if you have not made a reservation. Plan ahead. 1. Garden salad: not on the menu, but we figured we were having so many animal parts this was probably a good idea. $15 for generic salad. The salad was fresh but basic. 2. Mushroom risotto: this dish is very expensive for what it is, but you get a show. They come to your table with a large cheese bowl and add the risotto, mushroom, and even Canadian bacon. This dish had potential but was much too salty. It was hard to finish. 3. Terragon Bison tongue: this is tongue well done. The texture is very soft, which is impressive given the quality of most tongues. The sauces and everything just work well together. However, it's game-y so just be warned. 4. Foie gras poutine: loved it. The fries were good. The gravy was also good. The foie gras was in large blocks and was nice and fatty. I think if you come here, you should get this dish! 5. Duck in a Can: I loved watching them pour half a duck out of a can. Life experience. It even looked nice coming out. The duck came out as a thick filet attached to a flap of lard and also fatty liver (foie gras). I enjoyed this dish very much. It was over puréed cauliflower. The issue I had was that the duck meat was very thick. I had to eat it with slices of the lard to complement the taste. Overall a good dish. 6. Dessert: we got the maple cake and the lemon pie. Both were pretty good. Get the maple cake for novelty sake! Very sweet but good flavors. It was a pricy meal, but for a specialty restaurant it made sense.When my friend and I were certain we wanted to try Au Pied de Cochon, I tried to make reservation (1 week in advance) but their voicemail box was full... I didn't know what to do except, trying to call in the following days... And finally, 2 days before the date we wanted to go, I was finally able to make a reservation (but there weren't any tables left, and the lady asked me if it was okay to be seated at the counter/bar, which I was fine with).Being seated at the counter/bar was actually one exciting experience since we were able to watch the chefs cook and take a glance at all the dishes other customers ordered! It was really mind-blowing watching them cook in a fast-moving environment! I really liked their open-kitchen. It was also fun to guess whether the dish was ours or not too (it was our first time at Au Pied de Cochon, so we didn't know what to expect!)Before coming to Au Pied de Cochon, I searched other people's reviews and made my mind that I wanted to try their Duck in a Can! And this was one of the two dishes we ordered. We didn't know what to order next and my friend thought the The PDC Melting Pot has an interesting name, so we ordered that! Our waiter served us bread and butter (we didn't eat a lot since we wanted to save the tummy for our main courses, but the bread was not too hard, it was perfect!)Duck in a Can: Ordered it like I said because a lot of reviews said it is a must there! It is without doubt an interesting and fun dish. It came in a heated can (like how the name of the dish suggested). So, the waiter brought it over and opened it in front of you, poured the content out of the can (which contains the duck breast, 100g of foie gras, cabbages, the sauce) over the bread with carrot and cauliflower purée. The meat was really tender and it went very well with the cabbage, especially when you eat it with a small piece of duck meat. I actually really like the cabbage! It balanced the richness of the duck meat and foie gras very well. The fat under the duck meat was so chewy (I like chewy stuff) but the other fat part was.... I didn't like it since it was too greasy but some people like the feeling of fat melting in the mouth. We finished the dish (expect for the fat part) since it was too much for us.Duck in a can was quite an experience to be honest, it might not be my favorite dish due to its richness and especially oiliness but it was definitely an unique and interesting experience due to the presentation of the dish in a can!PDC Melting Pot:We actually preferred the melting pot because the taste wasn't as heavy as Duck in a Can and the pot was full of surprises, which made it more interesting. This dish came in a pot which was already hinted with its name! There was pork sausages, shiitake mushrooms, buttery potato cheese which was like mashed potatoes with cheese at the bottom, blood sausage -boudin but it is not like the Asian style one-, pork belly (so yummy!), pork loin and onions. There were a lot of things inside the pot; a lots of surprises! I absolutely loved the "buttery potato cheese", it was so delicious and well-made! The pork was tender and everything in this pot went extremely well with the mashed potatoes! The onion sauce was perfect too! It was a rich dish but not overwhelming like Duck in a Can.We also ordered their Milkshake XXX. My thought of my first sip: this is quite sweet... But afterwards, it got better! I don't know what was inside this milkshake... It tasted like rum (I'm not sure if it contained alcohol though). This was one rich milkshake I would say!We were basically in a food coma after this! I would definitely like to come back again and try their bison tongue (saw good reviews about it!)P.S: Make sure to make a reservation!!! Keep on trying even when their voicemail box is full!Service is outstanding. The employees are so attentive and seem to really love their jobs. Food it also outstanding and some of the best I have had in Montreal. I will say the food is really heavy and I don't want to think about the fat and calories. You'll probably walk out having eaten 2000 calories and well over 50 grams of fat, per person. Then again, if you really care about that stuff, subways right around the corner. Treat yourself, check it out. You will not be disappointed.We came to celebrate my husband's birthday. We reserved via email. It's the easiest way. I highly recommend reserving this way. I do not recommend going on Sunday's. They're out of everything. They were out of a few items. I didn't care for some, but being out of Ribs, Sweetbread, and BEER?! That was very disappointing. I ended up getting the famous Duck in a Can. Great flavour. Very delicious. Duck cooked to perfection. Then the Ragout. I liked the texture and how all the ingredients complimented each other, but it was wayyy too salty. I loved how it was prepared in a cheese block in front of us. Our waitress was rude and short with everything. Uninformative. We felt very rushed by her. Pretty much everything sucked but the Duck in a Can. I will come back and perhaps the experience will be better to tie with the good food.One of the best restaurants I have ever been to (if not the best).I had the duck in a can and my friend the risotto.The risotto is mixed in inside a large parmeggiano cheesw block and the duck is cooked inside the can for 27 minutes to a perfect taste.What an experienceService was great too!!Ouff getting a reservation at au PdeC was not an easy task ... who still operates over voicemail? Especially over a voicemail box that is always full?!But au PdeC still seems to get away with it thanks to all the hype Anthony Bourdain created during his 24 hour Montreal layover (if you've never watched it: dailymotion.com/.../xo2k…...).Needless to say, we had to try it out ourselves or we couldn't be called true Montrealers. But the overwhelming foie gras stuffed courses were too much for two people to handle, so we brought 2 friends for back up! All in all, if you come knowing that this will not be a fine dining experience and that you WILL be overindulging in rich and heavy courses, then your experience will be a satisfying one. And let's be honest, everything just tastes better with fat!From the foie gras stuffed croquettes that just ooze in your mouth as you bite into them, to the decadent poutine topped with foie gras gravy and a whole piece of foie gras and then the squash risotto cooked in a whole wheel of parmesan...! Your reward center will be firing away happy signals for hours to come smile emoticonAll this goodness, paired with a nice bottle of french wine (they have an extensive french heavy wine list and some good beer on tap) made this a highly enjoyable 'tourist in your own city experience'. Good food, good wine and great company along with a surprisingly affordable tab... what's not to like?Heard lots of great reviews for Au Pied de Cochon. This restaurant was featured on one of the shows by Anthony Bourdain! Service was excellent.DRINKS:Pied de Cochon beer x 2TERRAINE OF FOIE GRAS (4/5)Came with jam and bread. So delicious - it's pure foie gras. The taste is very strong and flavourful. A must for foie gras lovers :) I actually enjoyed this dish better without adding the jam on my slice of bread.FOIE GRAS POUTINE (5/5)A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! The closer you are to Montreal, the better the poutine gets and this one is a 5-star poutine for sure! Large slices of foie gras and big chunks of cheese.. mm fatty good!DUCK IN A CAN (5/5)So creative! It's a mini show when the waiter comes over and open the can in front of us (I recorded it all haha). The duck meat was tender and juicy - delicious. I would order this again the next time I visit Au Pied de Cochon.This place is the epitome of French Canadian cuisine. If you want an authentic Canadian culinary experience then this is not to be missed. The food is not for the faint of hearts and definitely leave your vegetarian friends at home. I wouldn't say this is a good everyday-go-to kinda restaurant so come here when you have visitors from out of town or for a special occasion. On to our meal. After cleansing our palettes with foie gras croquettes, we were ready for our main event. We bravely ordered the whole pig's head for two and I can say that it has been one of my most memorable meals. The head of pig was roasted to glistening perfection. Paired with apple and root veggies, the whole plate was full of flavour and tender juicy porky deliciousness. Since they have an open kitchen, people took pictures of our food as it made its way towards our table. It was quite the show! Have to admit I couldn't eat pork for a couple of weeks after but it was definitely worth every bite. Eating at Au Pied is a special event you don't want to miss.Do you love ducks? Or better yet, do you hate ducks? To the point where you'll eat ducks in every form for 3 different dishes? If so, Au Pied de Cochon is just what the doctor ordered.Sure, the name translates to the pig's feet, but the duck is where it's at.Foie gras poutine is about as rich and delicious as it sounds.The duck in a can (which COMES WITH FOIE GRAS) is also a must. Just watching the waiter take a can opener to it and drop it onto a plate is a thing of beauty. The entire can is boiled and then brought out. All the spices are infused and all the fattiness is preserved without getting boiled off. Super unique. Just don't overdo it. One can is probably enough for 3-4 people unless you REALLY want to feel unhealthy.We also got a side of duck fat fries, because WHY THE HELL NOT?There were 8 of us, so we did a few other entrees as well. One was the PDC's cut, which the waiter told us was a boneless pork chop (there was a bone). It looked dry, but it was actually incredibly moist. It was a gigantic hunk of meat too.We also did one of the specials - the Ahi tuna steak for two. Let me tell you, it was NOT for two. Maybe if you fasted and that was the only thing you ate that day. But it was also good. Perfectly rare, with a ton of veggies and cheese on the side. It was probably our least favorite of the dishes, but even still, it was very well done.We were seated all the way in the back by the wine cellar, so it was a bit of a tight squeeze (especially with another large group next to us), but there wasn't much else to complain about. They also have one hell of a wine list.Our waiter was super cool and gave us shots to round out the night.Probably one of the best meals I've ever had. Also, why I came back to the States with none of pants fitting anymore.Make reservations! Either call/email or reserve online. It's a must. Also come hungry, because, they serve a lot of food.This place gets super packed during the dinner rush. Even dining at the counter gets full.I'd recommend the foie gras duo to get the best out of APC. If you're dining with friends, then I'm sure you can taste each other's food. But for a single diner like myself, the foie gras duo comes with Foie Gras burger and foie gras poutine fries. Huge portions for about $50. Very fatty, very rich, and very good.I started off with the tuna tartare as an appetizer, but even though it is a small portion, I couldn't get through my foie gras duo because of the enormity of the portions. The tuna tartare was tarty and fresh.And I still wanted dessert after and I chose the toffee maple milk shake. They made it right in front me...I guess because I was in the counter, but you can see all the fatty goodness when they make this. Not to sweet, but I had enough room to finish it. I would order this again.Trying to find street parking might be hard for you during dinner time. And the metro station is several blocks away. You can probably try the bixi bikes if you have time to roam around this part of the Montreal neighborhood.Drip Drip Drip4 star for food and service but -0.5 star for all the water dripping from the vent on top of my head all through my dinner.Drip Drip Dip I know it was one of the hottest weekend in Montreal. It was end of July after all and I should be thankful for the nice cool interior of the restaurant with their AC on full blast. But with the water dripping on me the whole time (2 hour) while I was enjoying my dinner was not cool. The staff was all trying their best to stop the dripping from top of the AC vent which ran across the full depth of the restaurant by a squeegee sponge but it was not working....Drip Drip DripDinner was really good!! Excellent!We shared Tarragon Bison Tongue ($8.50) - I just love the Cornichon in that! And now I have a bottle in my fridge at home!Pâté de Campagne ($9) - So smooth and rich!Duck Carpaccio ($14) - Well seasoned, my first time having duck carpaccioDuck in a Can ($44) - So overhyped! The duck was dry and just not good! Foie Gras was so so. I don't believe I said that but I preferred mine seared...Braised Pig Feet with Side Pasta ($50) Seasonal - Must Order!! It was so tender and flavoured!! And the pasta which was prepared table side was so good! Perfect al dente and with BACON... Drip Drip DripI would have up my star to a 4 because the food was just amazing and the service was excellent. But the management really need to do something about their cooling system. I definitely would be back! PS The reservation system just got so much better as my reservation was confirmed by email and no need to play phone tag again!We had the foie gras poutine, stuffed pied de cochon with foie gras and a tuna dish. All were very rich in flavor and will lead to a heart attack BUT worth every bite. Poutine- get it! after all it is a Canadian dishStuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras- this is large enough for 3-4 people to share, the best part about this dish was the MASHED POTATO, it is sooooooooo good! it has a different texture from the typical mushy mashed potato. Tuna dish- our waiter picked this for us so I don't know what it's called but it's a pretty good dish with gravy and mashed potato on the bottom but it was a little salty though. Overall, amazing FATTY French Canadian food.Very rich food. If you like your food too creamy or too buttery, then this is your type of food. Everything was just very heavy and I couldn't seem to finish the dish. The FG is actually not bad as this was my first time tasting it. Definitely not something I would typically eat but at least I tried it! Plogue Champlain $29Pork filet $30Fg hamburger $39Squash risotto $24Fg poutine $24Eel tart $14The place was jam packed and there's absolutely no room to move if you're sitting on the outside of the table. Service is slow because of how busy it is. Might take you 10min to get the attention of a waitress and another 10 for the bill. Overall definitely a place to try but not something I would do again as its not really my type of food fare.I am judging overall as a meal and the service. First off, the place doesnt have a banner so it is difficult to spot if you dont know where it is. Foie gras poutine. Very good, the foie gras melted in with the poutine and you were able to taste the foie gras. The texture or the plate was consistant, there was cheesy, crispy and then the foie gras made it very good. you were able to taste that the fries were fried in the duck fat and the gravy was creamy and rich. with that being said, a very good dish but will get heavy and sickening after you eat too much of it.Foie gras a la champlain. foie gras on top of a thick slice of bacon, on a bed of thin crispy potato pancake (like a thin hashbrown), topped with a generous amount of maple syrup sauce. First bite was veryyyyy good!! So cripsy from the potato, the bacon was thick and the foie gras was enhanced in this plate, the maple syrup sauce was a good amount of sweet and salty. But this is definitely not a plate you eat on your own, its best for sharing because after a while the taste and maple syrup is quite overwhelming. table side Squash risotto. risotto was cooked very well but since it was table side she made it in the a large parmesan cheese, mixed it all together. She over poured the chicken broth and the risotto became a soup. The waiter asked how it was and I told him honestly that I did not like it because it was too watery. He left then about 3-4 mins later he asked me "do you want me to take it to the chef to try it", well no obviously not! She should have known when she served it because it was clearly too watery. He knew I was unhappy and he was the one that was pushing for this squash risotto, he didnt do anything to make up for the bad dish. At a resto like that I would expect so much more. Overall, theres definitely better. I'm glad I tried it but I would not be returning.We made the reservation two weeks ago. Probably because it's weekday, we are the only customers at 5:00pm.We didn't drink alcohol, only a bottle of water. The water is in glass bottle, taste better than thesame brand in plastic bottle.Tarragon Bison Tongue is the first dish. The tongue is from beef. Mr. Tang said it's good.

It balanced the richness of the duck meat and foie gras very well. The fat under the duck meat was so chewy (I like chewy stuff) but the other fat part was.... I didn't like it since it was too greasy but some people like the feeling of fat melting in the mouth. We finished the dish (expect for the fat part) since it was too much for us.Duck in a can was quite an experience to be honest, it might not be my favorite dish due to its richness and especially oiliness but it was definitely an unique and interesting experience due to the presentation of the dish in a can!PDC Melting Pot:We actually preferred the melting pot because the taste wasn't as heavy as Duck in a Can and the pot was full of surprises, which made it more interesting. This dish came in a pot which was already hinted with its name! There was pork sausages, shiitake mushrooms, buttery potato cheese which was like mashed potatoes with cheese at the bottom, blood sausage -boudin but it is not like the Asian style one-, pork belly (so yummy!), pork loin and onions. There were a lot of things inside the pot; a lots of surprises! I absolutely loved the "buttery potato cheese", it was so delicious and well-made! The pork was tender and everything in this pot went extremely well with the mashed potatoes! The onion sauce was perfect too! It was a rich dish but not overwhelming like Duck in a Can.We also ordered their Milkshake XXX. My thought of my first sip: this is quite sweet... But afterwards, it got better! I don't know what was inside this milkshake... It tasted like rum (I'm not sure if it contained alcohol though). This was one rich milkshake I would say!We were basically in a food coma after this! I would definitely like to come back again and try their bison tongue (saw good reviews about it!)P.S: Make sure to make a reservation!!! Keep on trying even when their voicemail box is full!Service is outstanding. The employees are so attentive and seem to really love their jobs. Food it also outstanding and some of the best I have had in Montreal. I will say the food is really heavy and I don't want to think about the fat and calories. You'll probably walk out having eaten 2000 calories and well over 50 grams of fat, per person. Then again, if you really care about that stuff, subways right around the corner. Treat yourself, check it out. You will not be disappointed.We came to celebrate my husband's birthday. We reserved via email. It's the easiest way. I highly recommend reserving this way. I do not recommend going on Sunday's. They're out of everything. They were out of a few items. I didn't care for some, but being out of Ribs, Sweetbread, and BEER?! That was very disappointing. I ended up getting the famous Duck in a Can. Great flavour. Very delicious. Duck cooked to perfection. Then the Ragout. I liked the texture and how all the ingredients complimented each other, but it was wayyy too salty. I loved how it was prepared in a cheese block in front of us. Our waitress was rude and short with everything. Uninformative. We felt very rushed by her. Pretty much everything sucked but the Duck in a Can. I will come back and perhaps the experience will be better to tie with the good food.One of the best restaurants I have ever been to (if not the best).I had the duck in a can and my friend the risotto.The risotto is mixed in inside a large parmeggiano cheesw block and the duck is cooked inside the can for 27 minutes to a perfect taste.What an experienceService was great too!!Ouff getting a reservation at au PdeC was not an easy task ... who still operates over voicemail? Especially over a voicemail box that is always full?!But au PdeC still seems to get away with it thanks to all the hype Anthony Bourdain created during his 24 hour Montreal layover (if you've never watched it: dailymotion.com/.../xo2k…...).Needless to say, we had to try it out ourselves or we couldn't be called true Montrealers. But the overwhelming foie gras stuffed courses were too much for two people to handle, so we brought 2 friends for back up! All in all, if you come knowing that this will not be a fine dining experience and that you WILL be overindulging in rich and heavy courses, then your experience will be a satisfying one. And let's be honest, everything just tastes better with fat!From the foie gras stuffed croquettes that just ooze in your mouth as you bite into them, to the decadent poutine topped with foie gras gravy and a whole piece of foie gras and then the squash risotto cooked in a whole wheel of parmesan...! Your reward center will be firing away happy signals for hours to come smile emoticonAll this goodness, paired with a nice bottle of french wine (they have an extensive french heavy wine list and some good beer on tap) made this a highly enjoyable 'tourist in your own city experience'. Good food, good wine and great company along with a surprisingly affordable tab... what's not to like?Heard lots of great reviews for Au Pied de Cochon. This restaurant was featured on one of the shows by Anthony Bourdain! Service was excellent.DRINKS:Pied de Cochon beer x 2TERRAINE OF FOIE GRAS (4/5)Came with jam and bread. So delicious - it's pure foie gras. The taste is very strong and flavourful. A must for foie gras lovers :) I actually enjoyed this dish better without adding the jam on my slice of bread.FOIE GRAS POUTINE (5/5)A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! The closer you are to Montreal, the better the poutine gets and this one is a 5-star poutine for sure! Large slices of foie gras and big chunks of cheese.. mm fatty good!DUCK IN A CAN (5/5)So creative! It's a mini show when the waiter comes over and open the can in front of us (I recorded it all haha). The duck meat was tender and juicy - delicious. I would order this again the next time I visit Au Pied de Cochon.This place is the epitome of French Canadian cuisine. If you want an authentic Canadian culinary experience then this is not to be missed. The food is not for the faint of hearts and definitely leave your vegetarian friends at home. I wouldn't say this is a good everyday-go-to kinda restaurant so come here when you have visitors from out of town or for a special occasion. On to our meal. After cleansing our palettes with foie gras croquettes, we were ready for our main event. We bravely ordered the whole pig's head for two and I can say that it has been one of my most memorable meals. The head of pig was roasted to glistening perfection. Paired with apple and root veggies, the whole plate was full of flavour and tender juicy porky deliciousness. Since they have an open kitchen, people took pictures of our food as it made its way towards our table. It was quite the show! Have to admit I couldn't eat pork for a couple of weeks after but it was definitely worth every bite. Eating at Au Pied is a special event you don't want to miss.Do you love ducks? Or better yet, do you hate ducks? To the point where you'll eat ducks in every form for 3 different dishes? If so, Au Pied de Cochon is just what the doctor ordered.Sure, the name translates to the pig's feet, but the duck is where it's at.Foie gras poutine is about as rich and delicious as it sounds.The duck in a can (which COMES WITH FOIE GRAS) is also a must. Just watching the waiter take a can opener to it and drop it onto a plate is a thing of beauty. The entire can is boiled and then brought out. All the spices are infused and all the fattiness is preserved without getting boiled off. Super unique. Just don't overdo it. One can is probably enough for 3-4 people unless you REALLY want to feel unhealthy.We also got a side of duck fat fries, because WHY THE HELL NOT?There were 8 of us, so we did a few other entrees as well. One was the PDC's cut, which the waiter told us was a boneless pork chop (there was a bone). It looked dry, but it was actually incredibly moist. It was a gigantic hunk of meat too.We also did one of the specials - the Ahi tuna steak for two. Let me tell you, it was NOT for two. Maybe if you fasted and that was the only thing you ate that day. But it was also good. Perfectly rare, with a ton of veggies and cheese on the side. It was probably our least favorite of the dishes, but even still, it was very well done.We were seated all the way in the back by the wine cellar, so it was a bit of a tight squeeze (especially with another large group next to us), but there wasn't much else to complain about. They also have one hell of a wine list.Our waiter was super cool and gave us shots to round out the night.Probably one of the best meals I've ever had. Also, why I came back to the States with none of pants fitting anymore.Make reservations! Either call/email or reserve online. It's a must. Also come hungry, because, they serve a lot of food.This place gets super packed during the dinner rush. Even dining at the counter gets full.I'd recommend the foie gras duo to get the best out of APC. If you're dining with friends, then I'm sure you can taste each other's food. But for a single diner like myself, the foie gras duo comes with Foie Gras burger and foie gras poutine fries. Huge portions for about $50. Very fatty, very rich, and very good.I started off with the tuna tartare as an appetizer, but even though it is a small portion, I couldn't get through my foie gras duo because of the enormity of the portions. The tuna tartare was tarty and fresh.And I still wanted dessert after and I chose the toffee maple milk shake. They made it right in front me...I guess because I was in the counter, but you can see all the fatty goodness when they make this. Not to sweet, but I had enough room to finish it. I would order this again.Trying to find street parking might be hard for you during dinner time. And the metro station is several blocks away. You can probably try the bixi bikes if you have time to roam around this part of the Montreal neighborhood.Drip Drip Drip4 star for food and service but -0.5 star for all the water dripping from the vent on top of my head all through my dinner.Drip Drip Dip I know it was one of the hottest weekend in Montreal. It was end of July after all and I should be thankful for the nice cool interior of the restaurant with their AC on full blast. But with the water dripping on me the whole time (2 hour) while I was enjoying my dinner was not cool. The staff was all trying their best to stop the dripping from top of the AC vent which ran across the full depth of the restaurant by a squeegee sponge but it was not working....Drip Drip DripDinner was really good!! Excellent!We shared Tarragon Bison Tongue ($8.50) - I just love the Cornichon in that! And now I have a bottle in my fridge at home!Pâté de Campagne ($9) - So smooth and rich!Duck Carpaccio ($14) - Well seasoned, my first time having duck carpaccioDuck in a Can ($44) - So overhyped! The duck was dry and just not good! Foie Gras was so so. I don't believe I said that but I preferred mine seared...Braised Pig Feet with Side Pasta ($50) Seasonal - Must Order!! It was so tender and flavoured!! And the pasta which was prepared table side was so good! Perfect al dente and with BACON... Drip Drip DripI would have up my star to a 4 because the food was just amazing and the service was excellent. But the management really need to do something about their cooling system. I definitely would be back! PS The reservation system just got so much better as my reservation was confirmed by email and no need to play phone tag again!We had the foie gras poutine, stuffed pied de cochon with foie gras and a tuna dish. All were very rich in flavor and will lead to a heart attack BUT worth every bite. Poutine- get it! after all it is a Canadian dishStuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras- this is large enough for 3-4 people to share, the best part about this dish was the MASHED POTATO, it is sooooooooo good! it has a different texture from the typical mushy mashed potato. Tuna dish- our waiter picked this for us so I don't know what it's called but it's a pretty good dish with gravy and mashed potato on the bottom but it was a little salty though. Overall, amazing FATTY French Canadian food.Very rich food. If you like your food too creamy or too buttery, then this is your type of food. Everything was just very heavy and I couldn't seem to finish the dish. The FG is actually not bad as this was my first time tasting it. Definitely not something I would typically eat but at least I tried it! Plogue Champlain $29Pork filet $30Fg hamburger $39Squash risotto $24Fg poutine $24Eel tart $14The place was jam packed and there's absolutely no room to move if you're sitting on the outside of the table. Service is slow because of how busy it is. Might take you 10min to get the attention of a waitress and another 10 for the bill. Overall definitely a place to try but not something I would do again as its not really my type of food fare.I am judging overall as a meal and the service. First off, the place doesnt have a banner so it is difficult to spot if you dont know where it is. Foie gras poutine. Very good, the foie gras melted in with the poutine and you were able to taste the foie gras. The texture or the plate was consistant, there was cheesy, crispy and then the foie gras made it very good. you were able to taste that the fries were fried in the duck fat and the gravy was creamy and rich. with that being said, a very good dish but will get heavy and sickening after you eat too much of it.Foie gras a la champlain. foie gras on top of a thick slice of bacon, on a bed of thin crispy potato pancake (like a thin hashbrown), topped with a generous amount of maple syrup sauce. First bite was veryyyyy good!! So cripsy from the potato, the bacon was thick and the foie gras was enhanced in this plate, the maple syrup sauce was a good amount of sweet and salty. But this is definitely not a plate you eat on your own, its best for sharing because after a while the taste and maple syrup is quite overwhelming. table side Squash risotto. risotto was cooked very well but since it was table side she made it in the a large parmesan cheese, mixed it all together. She over poured the chicken broth and the risotto became a soup. The waiter asked how it was and I told him honestly that I did not like it because it was too watery. He left then about 3-4 mins later he asked me "do you want me to take it to the chef to try it", well no obviously not! She should have known when she served it because it was clearly too watery. He knew I was unhappy and he was the one that was pushing for this squash risotto, he didnt do anything to make up for the bad dish. At a resto like that I would expect so much more. Overall, theres definitely better. I'm glad I tried it but I would not be returning.We made the reservation two weeks ago. Probably because it's weekday, we are the only customers at 5:00pm.We didn't drink alcohol, only a bottle of water. The water is in glass bottle, taste better than thesame brand in plastic bottle.Tarragon Bison Tongue is the first dish. The tongue is from beef. Mr. Tang said it's good. I prefer the pickle, since I didn't try the tongue.Catch of the day, we picked the smoked eel. It also served with a piece of veal bone, you can eat the marrow(not sure if it's this word...).Fg poutine is great, although foie gras is too greasy for me.The duck in a can is great too. The duck is juicy and fresh, also with blood. The veggie taste a bit sour, really savory.The one missing star is for the dessert. Both icecream and pecan pie are too sweet for me to enjoy.After much hype, I made it here with a few colleagues on a Wednesday evening. The place was absolutely hopping and hard to get into, but we made a reservation a few weeks in advance.Once inside we sat at the bar, which is by far the best seat in the house. It comes with a direct view of the kitchen and all the goodness the chefs are whipping up. We started out with the ham special for appetizer, which was delicious. It came with a baguette and butter which made it perfect. We then had some poutine, which was also quite good. It was definitely better quality than most poutine dishes. For the main course, I went aggressive and got a mixed bowl consisting of blood sausage, pork sausage, mushrooms and onions sitting on top of mashed potatoes. The dish was very good, but not the amazing experience I was hoping for. Spices could have been a little better, but make no mistake it was a very good dish.With its popular reputation, upbeat atmosphere and good food, this is definitely a place worth visiting when in town. They also have a really good bar with interesting drinks. Great overall experience.Delicious food and a must if you're in Montreal. Come in hungry bc you'll get a rich and hearty meal. We ordered the infamous duck in a can, mushroom tortellini (tonites special), the steamed dumplings & plogue a Champlain "foie gras breakfast" - which was the highlight of the night. buckwheat pancake,  thick Canadian bacon, potatoes and cheese topped with foie gras. I wish it was one of the earlier items delivered I would have enjoyed a few more bites. Would def come here with a group to be able to taste more items on the menu. It's a busy restaurant so do make reservations. We scored 9:30 pm reservations on a Sunday night and place was packed with ppl still coming in with reservations after us. Service was slow and we had a really long wait b/t entrees coming out. We didn't leave until after 11:30. Luckily for us, our toddler was still on California time and was cooperative.Visit Montreal for a weekend and made a reservation two weeks in advance. Not too hard: I left a voicemail and someone called me back the next day. Between my friend and I, we ordered:- cromesquis de foie gras, basically deep fried fg. For $4, it was worth it. - temaki tartare, tartare Japanese hand roll. They didn't have bison available and we were offered veal. I quite enjoyed the layers of flavour and texture. - carpaccio de canard, duck carpaccio. My second favorite of the night. - and finally, poutine au foie gras. I hate to say it but this was a bit of a disappointment. I'm a fan of fg but this didn't have the ah-ha for me. We went later in the evening and 2 of the 3 cocktails were already sold out. My reco would be to go early. We also had a lot of trouble finding this place late at night. You really have to know what the front looks like!If you love pork and foie gras, this place is heaven. Recommend getting the foie gras poutine and the duck in a can. We also ordered the onion soup, duck carpaccio and the dumplings.Onion soup - your standard cheesy onion soup done right. Super tasty. Foie gras Poutine - must get!! Abundance of extra buttery and fatty foie gras with fries and gravy. This is a heavy dish so great for sharing and having a cold beer. Duck carpaccio - the presentation of the dish was beautiful. Thinly slice duck with chives, raw mushrooms and a yolk. Duck in a can - must get as well! The waiter brings over the can and opens it in front of the table. The content of the can contains the small duck, foie gras, cabbage which is all poured over the bread with carrot purée. The meat was tender and succulent.The service was very good - our waiter was extremely nice and helpful in making suggestions. There are so many options to choose from so it's great if you come with a big group and share everything!This place is insanely delicious.  The restaurant is a bit tight on space but the kitchen is opened. You can actually hear the staff call out orders.  There are so many options that we probably over ordered for two people!! For starters, we had poutine with foie gras, duck carpaccio and beef tongue.  For entrees we had the duck in a can and the blood sausage tart.  The duck in the can was amazing! We totally over did it on the foie gras but you only live once! We had so much foodWe had to call ahead so the restaurant could accommodate our baby.I went with a southern French person to this restaurant but he did not completely agree with my assessment. Just a caveat. :-)We really wanted to try a Montreal special, as this place is very well known. This place has the famous foie gras poutine and Duck in a Can. We decided to all share to try a few more dishes. The baguette is good!The ambience is nice. We went right when it opened and there was a small line waiting. You cannot get seated if you have not made a reservation. Plan ahead. 1. Garden salad: not on the menu, but we figured we were having so many animal parts this was probably a good idea. $15 for generic salad. The salad was fresh but basic. 2. Mushroom risotto: this dish is very expensive for what it is, but you get a show. They come to your table with a large cheese bowl and add the risotto, mushroom, and even Canadian bacon. This dish had potential but was much too salty. It was hard to finish. 3. Terragon Bison tongue: this is tongue well done. The texture is very soft, which is impressive given the quality of most tongues. The sauces and everything just work well together. However, it's game-y so just be warned. 4. Foie gras poutine: loved it. The fries were good. The gravy was also good. The foie gras was in large blocks and was nice and fatty. I think if you come here, you should get this dish! 5. Duck in a Can: I loved watching them pour half a duck out of a can. Life experience. It even looked nice coming out. The duck came out as a thick filet attached to a flap of lard and also fatty liver (foie gras). I enjoyed this dish very much. It was over puréed cauliflower. The issue I had was that the duck meat was very thick. I had to eat it with slices of the lard to complement the taste. Overall a good dish. 6. Dessert: we got the maple cake and the lemon pie. Both were pretty good. Get the maple cake for novelty sake! Very sweet but good flavors. It was a pricy meal, but for a specialty restaurant it made sense.When my friend and I were certain we wanted to try Au Pied de Cochon, I tried to make reservation (1 week in advance) but their voicemail box was full... I didn't know what to do except, trying to call in the following days... And finally, 2 days before the date we wanted to go, I was finally able to make a reservation (but there weren't any tables left, and the lady asked me if it was okay to be seated at the counter/bar, which I was fine with).Being seated at the counter/bar was actually one exciting experience since we were able to watch the chefs cook and take a glance at all the dishes other customers ordered! It was really mind-blowing watching them cook in a fast-moving environment! I really liked their open-kitchen. It was also fun to guess whether the dish was ours or not too (it was our first time at Au Pied de Cochon, so we didn't know what to expect!)Before coming to Au Pied de Cochon, I searched other people's reviews and made my mind that I wanted to try their Duck in a Can! And this was one of the two dishes we ordered. We didn't know what to order next and my friend thought the The PDC Melting Pot has an interesting name, so we ordered that! Our waiter served us bread and butter (we didn't eat a lot since we wanted to save the tummy for our main courses, but the bread was not too hard, it was perfect!)Duck in a Can: Ordered it like I said because a lot of reviews said it is a must there! It is without doubt an interesting and fun dish. It came in a heated can (like how the name of the dish suggested). So, the waiter brought it over and opened it in front of you, poured the content out of the can (which contains the duck breast, 100g of foie gras, cabbages, the sauce) over the bread with carrot and cauliflower purée. The meat was really tender and it went very well with the cabbage, especially when you eat it with a small piece of duck meat. I actually really like the cabbage!

The tuna tartare was tarty and fresh.And I still wanted dessert after and I chose the toffee maple milk shake. They made it right in front me...I guess because I was in the counter, but you can see all the fatty goodness when they make this. Not to sweet, but I had enough room to finish it. I would order this again.Trying to find street parking might be hard for you during dinner time. And the metro station is several blocks away. You can probably try the bixi bikes if you have time to roam around this part of the Montreal neighborhood.Drip Drip Drip4 star for food and service but -0.5 star for all the water dripping from the vent on top of my head all through my dinner.Drip Drip Dip I know it was one of the hottest weekend in Montreal. It was end of July after all and I should be thankful for the nice cool interior of the restaurant with their AC on full blast. But with the water dripping on me the whole time (2 hour) while I was enjoying my dinner was not cool. The staff was all trying their best to stop the dripping from top of the AC vent which ran across the full depth of the restaurant by a squeegee sponge but it was not working....Drip Drip DripDinner was really good!! Excellent!We shared Tarragon Bison Tongue ($8.50) - I just love the Cornichon in that! And now I have a bottle in my fridge at home!Pâté de Campagne ($9) - So smooth and rich!Duck Carpaccio ($14) - Well seasoned, my first time having duck carpaccioDuck in a Can ($44) - So overhyped! The duck was dry and just not good! Foie Gras was so so. I don't believe I said that but I preferred mine seared...Braised Pig Feet with Side Pasta ($50) Seasonal - Must Order!! It was so tender and flavoured!! And the pasta which was prepared table side was so good! Perfect al dente and with BACON... Drip Drip DripI would have up my star to a 4 because the food was just amazing and the service was excellent. But the management really need to do something about their cooling system. I definitely would be back! PS The reservation system just got so much better as my reservation was confirmed by email and no need to play phone tag again!We had the foie gras poutine, stuffed pied de cochon with foie gras and a tuna dish. All were very rich in flavor and will lead to a heart attack BUT worth every bite. Poutine- get it! after all it is a Canadian dishStuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras- this is large enough for 3-4 people to share, the best part about this dish was the MASHED POTATO, it is sooooooooo good! it has a different texture from the typical mushy mashed potato. Tuna dish- our waiter picked this for us so I don't know what it's called but it's a pretty good dish with gravy and mashed potato on the bottom but it was a little salty though. Overall, amazing FATTY French Canadian food.Very rich food. If you like your food too creamy or too buttery, then this is your type of food. Everything was just very heavy and I couldn't seem to finish the dish. The FG is actually not bad as this was my first time tasting it. Definitely not something I would typically eat but at least I tried it! Plogue Champlain $29Pork filet $30Fg hamburger $39Squash risotto $24Fg poutine $24Eel tart $14The place was jam packed and there's absolutely no room to move if you're sitting on the outside of the table. Service is slow because of how busy it is. Might take you 10min to get the attention of a waitress and another 10 for the bill. Overall definitely a place to try but not something I would do again as its not really my type of food fare.I am judging overall as a meal and the service. First off, the place doesnt have a banner so it is difficult to spot if you dont know where it is. Foie gras poutine. Very good, the foie gras melted in with the poutine and you were able to taste the foie gras. The texture or the plate was consistant, there was cheesy, crispy and then the foie gras made it very good. you were able to taste that the fries were fried in the duck fat and the gravy was creamy and rich. with that being said, a very good dish but will get heavy and sickening after you eat too much of it.Foie gras a la champlain. foie gras on top of a thick slice of bacon, on a bed of thin crispy potato pancake (like a thin hashbrown), topped with a generous amount of maple syrup sauce. First bite was veryyyyy good!! So cripsy from the potato, the bacon was thick and the foie gras was enhanced in this plate, the maple syrup sauce was a good amount of sweet and salty. But this is definitely not a plate you eat on your own, its best for sharing because after a while the taste and maple syrup is quite overwhelming. table side Squash risotto. risotto was cooked very well but since it was table side she made it in the a large parmesan cheese, mixed it all together. She over poured the chicken broth and the risotto became a soup. The waiter asked how it was and I told him honestly that I did not like it because it was too watery. He left then about 3-4 mins later he asked me "do you want me to take it to the chef to try it", well no obviously not! She should have known when she served it because it was clearly too watery. He knew I was unhappy and he was the one that was pushing for this squash risotto, he didnt do anything to make up for the bad dish. At a resto like that I would expect so much more. Overall, theres definitely better. I'm glad I tried it but I would not be returning.We made the reservation two weeks ago. Probably because it's weekday, we are the only customers at 5:00pm.We didn't drink alcohol, only a bottle of water. The water is in glass bottle, taste better than thesame brand in plastic bottle.Tarragon Bison Tongue is the first dish. The tongue is from beef. Mr. Tang said it's good. I prefer the pickle, since I didn't try the tongue.Catch of the day, we picked the smoked eel. It also served with a piece of veal bone, you can eat the marrow(not sure if it's this word...).Fg poutine is great, although foie gras is too greasy for me.The duck in a can is great too. The duck is juicy and fresh, also with blood. The veggie taste a bit sour, really savory.The one missing star is for the dessert. Both icecream and pecan pie are too sweet for me to enjoy.After much hype, I made it here with a few colleagues on a Wednesday evening. The place was absolutely hopping and hard to get into, but we made a reservation a few weeks in advance.Once inside we sat at the bar, which is by far the best seat in the house. It comes with a direct view of the kitchen and all the goodness the chefs are whipping up. We started out with the ham special for appetizer, which was delicious. It came with a baguette and butter which made it perfect. We then had some poutine, which was also quite good. It was definitely better quality than most poutine dishes. For the main course, I went aggressive and got a mixed bowl consisting of blood sausage, pork sausage, mushrooms and onions sitting on top of mashed potatoes. The dish was very good, but not the amazing experience I was hoping for. Spices could have been a little better, but make no mistake it was a very good dish.With its popular reputation, upbeat atmosphere and good food, this is definitely a place worth visiting when in town. They also have a really good bar with interesting drinks. Great overall experience.Delicious food and a must if you're in Montreal. Come in hungry bc you'll get a rich and hearty meal. We ordered the infamous duck in a can, mushroom tortellini (tonites special), the steamed dumplings & plogue a Champlain "foie gras breakfast" - which was the highlight of the night. buckwheat pancake,  thick Canadian bacon, potatoes and cheese topped with foie gras. I wish it was one of the earlier items delivered I would have enjoyed a few more bites. Would def come here with a group to be able to taste more items on the menu. It's a busy restaurant so do make reservations. We scored 9:30 pm reservations on a Sunday night and place was packed with ppl still coming in with reservations after us. Service was slow and we had a really long wait b/t entrees coming out. We didn't leave until after 11:30. Luckily for us, our toddler was still on California time and was cooperative.Visit Montreal for a weekend and made a reservation two weeks in advance. Not too hard: I left a voicemail and someone called me back the next day. Between my friend and I, we ordered:- cromesquis de foie gras, basically deep fried fg. For $4, it was worth it. - temaki tartare, tartare Japanese hand roll. They didn't have bison available and we were offered veal. I quite enjoyed the layers of flavour and texture. - carpaccio de canard, duck carpaccio. My second favorite of the night. - and finally, poutine au foie gras. I hate to say it but this was a bit of a disappointment. I'm a fan of fg but this didn't have the ah-ha for me. We went later in the evening and 2 of the 3 cocktails were already sold out. My reco would be to go early. We also had a lot of trouble finding this place late at night. You really have to know what the front looks like!If you love pork and foie gras, this place is heaven. Recommend getting the foie gras poutine and the duck in a can. We also ordered the onion soup, duck carpaccio and the dumplings.Onion soup - your standard cheesy onion soup done right. Super tasty. Foie gras Poutine - must get!! Abundance of extra buttery and fatty foie gras with fries and gravy. This is a heavy dish so great for sharing and having a cold beer. Duck carpaccio - the presentation of the dish was beautiful. Thinly slice duck with chives, raw mushrooms and a yolk. Duck in a can - must get as well! The waiter brings over the can and opens it in front of the table. The content of the can contains the small duck, foie gras, cabbage which is all poured over the bread with carrot purée. The meat was tender and succulent.The service was very good - our waiter was extremely nice and helpful in making suggestions. There are so many options to choose from so it's great if you come with a big group and share everything!This place is insanely delicious.  The restaurant is a bit tight on space but the kitchen is opened. You can actually hear the staff call out orders.  There are so many options that we probably over ordered for two people!! For starters, we had poutine with foie gras, duck carpaccio and beef tongue.  For entrees we had the duck in a can and the blood sausage tart.  The duck in the can was amazing! We totally over did it on the foie gras but you only live once! We had so much foodWe had to call ahead so the restaurant could accommodate our baby.I went with a southern French person to this restaurant but he did not completely agree with my assessment. Just a caveat. :-)We really wanted to try a Montreal special, as this place is very well known. This place has the famous foie gras poutine and Duck in a Can. We decided to all share to try a few more dishes. The baguette is good!The ambience is nice. We went right when it opened and there was a small line waiting. You cannot get seated if you have not made a reservation. Plan ahead. 1. Garden salad: not on the menu, but we figured we were having so many animal parts this was probably a good idea. $15 for generic salad. The salad was fresh but basic. 2. Mushroom risotto: this dish is very expensive for what it is, but you get a show. They come to your table with a large cheese bowl and add the risotto, mushroom, and even Canadian bacon. This dish had potential but was much too salty. It was hard to finish. 3. Terragon Bison tongue: this is tongue well done. The texture is very soft, which is impressive given the quality of most tongues. The sauces and everything just work well together. However, it's game-y so just be warned. 4. Foie gras poutine: loved it. The fries were good. The gravy was also good. The foie gras was in large blocks and was nice and fatty. I think if you come here, you should get this dish! 5. Duck in a Can: I loved watching them pour half a duck out of a can. Life experience. It even looked nice coming out. The duck came out as a thick filet attached to a flap of lard and also fatty liver (foie gras). I enjoyed this dish very much. It was over puréed cauliflower. The issue I had was that the duck meat was very thick. I had to eat it with slices of the lard to complement the taste. Overall a good dish. 6. Dessert: we got the maple cake and the lemon pie. Both were pretty good. Get the maple cake for novelty sake! Very sweet but good flavors. It was a pricy meal, but for a specialty restaurant it made sense.When my friend and I were certain we wanted to try Au Pied de Cochon, I tried to make reservation (1 week in advance) but their voicemail box was full... I didn't know what to do except, trying to call in the following days... And finally, 2 days before the date we wanted to go, I was finally able to make a reservation (but there weren't any tables left, and the lady asked me if it was okay to be seated at the counter/bar, which I was fine with).Being seated at the counter/bar was actually one exciting experience since we were able to watch the chefs cook and take a glance at all the dishes other customers ordered! It was really mind-blowing watching them cook in a fast-moving environment! I really liked their open-kitchen. It was also fun to guess whether the dish was ours or not too (it was our first time at Au Pied de Cochon, so we didn't know what to expect!)Before coming to Au Pied de Cochon, I searched other people's reviews and made my mind that I wanted to try their Duck in a Can! And this was one of the two dishes we ordered. We didn't know what to order next and my friend thought the The PDC Melting Pot has an interesting name, so we ordered that! Our waiter served us bread and butter (we didn't eat a lot since we wanted to save the tummy for our main courses, but the bread was not too hard, it was perfect!)Duck in a Can: Ordered it like I said because a lot of reviews said it is a must there! It is without doubt an interesting and fun dish. It came in a heated can (like how the name of the dish suggested). So, the waiter brought it over and opened it in front of you, poured the content out of the can (which contains the duck breast, 100g of foie gras, cabbages, the sauce) over the bread with carrot and cauliflower purée. The meat was really tender and it went very well with the cabbage, especially when you eat it with a small piece of duck meat. I actually really like the cabbage! It balanced the richness of the duck meat and foie gras very well. The fat under the duck meat was so chewy (I like chewy stuff) but the other fat part was.... I didn't like it since it was too greasy but some people like the feeling of fat melting in the mouth. We finished the dish (expect for the fat part) since it was too much for us.Duck in a can was quite an experience to be honest, it might not be my favorite dish due to its richness and especially oiliness but it was definitely an unique and interesting experience due to the presentation of the dish in a can!PDC Melting Pot:We actually preferred the melting pot because the taste wasn't as heavy as Duck in a Can and the pot was full of surprises, which made it more interesting. This dish came in a pot which was already hinted with its name! There was pork sausages, shiitake mushrooms, buttery potato cheese which was like mashed potatoes with cheese at the bottom, blood sausage -boudin but it is not like the Asian style one-, pork belly (so yummy!), pork loin and onions. There were a lot of things inside the pot; a lots of surprises! I absolutely loved the "buttery potato cheese", it was so delicious and well-made! The pork was tender and everything in this pot went extremely well with the mashed potatoes! The onion sauce was perfect too! It was a rich dish but not overwhelming like Duck in a Can.We also ordered their Milkshake XXX. My thought of my first sip: this is quite sweet... But afterwards, it got better! I don't know what was inside this milkshake... It tasted like rum (I'm not sure if it contained alcohol though). This was one rich milkshake I would say!We were basically in a food coma after this! I would definitely like to come back again and try their bison tongue (saw good reviews about it!)P.S: Make sure to make a reservation!!! Keep on trying even when their voicemail box is full!Service is outstanding. The employees are so attentive and seem to really love their jobs. Food it also outstanding and some of the best I have had in Montreal. I will say the food is really heavy and I don't want to think about the fat and calories. You'll probably walk out having eaten 2000 calories and well over 50 grams of fat, per person. Then again, if you really care about that stuff, subways right around the corner. Treat yourself, check it out. You will not be disappointed.We came to celebrate my husband's birthday. We reserved via email. It's the easiest way. I highly recommend reserving this way. I do not recommend going on Sunday's. They're out of everything. They were out of a few items. I didn't care for some, but being out of Ribs, Sweetbread, and BEER?! That was very disappointing. I ended up getting the famous Duck in a Can. Great flavour. Very delicious. Duck cooked to perfection. Then the Ragout. I liked the texture and how all the ingredients complimented each other, but it was wayyy too salty. I loved how it was prepared in a cheese block in front of us. Our waitress was rude and short with everything. Uninformative. We felt very rushed by her. Pretty much everything sucked but the Duck in a Can. I will come back and perhaps the experience will be better to tie with the good food.One of the best restaurants I have ever been to (if not the best).I had the duck in a can and my friend the risotto.The risotto is mixed in inside a large parmeggiano cheesw block and the duck is cooked inside the can for 27 minutes to a perfect taste.What an experienceService was great too!!Ouff getting a reservation at au PdeC was not an easy task ... who still operates over voicemail? Especially over a voicemail box that is always full?!But au PdeC still seems to get away with it thanks to all the hype Anthony Bourdain created during his 24 hour Montreal layover (if you've never watched it: dailymotion.com/.../xo2k…...).Needless to say, we had to try it out ourselves or we couldn't be called true Montrealers. But the overwhelming foie gras stuffed courses were too much for two people to handle, so we brought 2 friends for back up! All in all, if you come knowing that this will not be a fine dining experience and that you WILL be overindulging in rich and heavy courses, then your experience will be a satisfying one. And let's be honest, everything just tastes better with fat!From the foie gras stuffed croquettes that just ooze in your mouth as you bite into them, to the decadent poutine topped with foie gras gravy and a whole piece of foie gras and then the squash risotto cooked in a whole wheel of parmesan...! Your reward center will be firing away happy signals for hours to come smile emoticonAll this goodness, paired with a nice bottle of french wine (they have an extensive french heavy wine list and some good beer on tap) made this a highly enjoyable 'tourist in your own city experience'. Good food, good wine and great company along with a surprisingly affordable tab... what's not to like?Heard lots of great reviews for Au Pied de Cochon. This restaurant was featured on one of the shows by Anthony Bourdain! Service was excellent.DRINKS:Pied de Cochon beer x 2TERRAINE OF FOIE GRAS (4/5)Came with jam and bread. So delicious - it's pure foie gras. The taste is very strong and flavourful. A must for foie gras lovers :) I actually enjoyed this dish better without adding the jam on my slice of bread.FOIE GRAS POUTINE (5/5)A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! The closer you are to Montreal, the better the poutine gets and this one is a 5-star poutine for sure! Large slices of foie gras and big chunks of cheese.. mm fatty good!DUCK IN A CAN (5/5)So creative! It's a mini show when the waiter comes over and open the can in front of us (I recorded it all haha). The duck meat was tender and juicy - delicious. I would order this again the next time I visit Au Pied de Cochon.This place is the epitome of French Canadian cuisine. If you want an authentic Canadian culinary experience then this is not to be missed. The food is not for the faint of hearts and definitely leave your vegetarian friends at home. I wouldn't say this is a good everyday-go-to kinda restaurant so come here when you have visitors from out of town or for a special occasion. On to our meal. After cleansing our palettes with foie gras croquettes, we were ready for our main event. We bravely ordered the whole pig's head for two and I can say that it has been one of my most memorable meals. The head of pig was roasted to glistening perfection. Paired with apple and root veggies, the whole plate was full of flavour and tender juicy porky deliciousness. Since they have an open kitchen, people took pictures of our food as it made its way towards our table. It was quite the show! Have to admit I couldn't eat pork for a couple of weeks after but it was definitely worth every bite. Eating at Au Pied is a special event you don't want to miss.Do you love ducks? Or better yet, do you hate ducks? To the point where you'll eat ducks in every form for 3 different dishes? If so, Au Pied de Cochon is just what the doctor ordered.Sure, the name translates to the pig's feet, but the duck is where it's at.Foie gras poutine is about as rich and delicious as it sounds.The duck in a can (which COMES WITH FOIE GRAS) is also a must. Just watching the waiter take a can opener to it and drop it onto a plate is a thing of beauty. The entire can is boiled and then brought out. All the spices are infused and all the fattiness is preserved without getting boiled off. Super unique. Just don't overdo it. One can is probably enough for 3-4 people unless you REALLY want to feel unhealthy.We also got a side of duck fat fries, because WHY THE HELL NOT?There were 8 of us, so we did a few other entrees as well. One was the PDC's cut, which the waiter told us was a boneless pork chop (there was a bone). It looked dry, but it was actually incredibly moist. It was a gigantic hunk of meat too.We also did one of the specials - the Ahi tuna steak for two. Let me tell you, it was NOT for two. Maybe if you fasted and that was the only thing you ate that day. But it was also good. Perfectly rare, with a ton of veggies and cheese on the side. It was probably our least favorite of the dishes, but even still, it was very well done.We were seated all the way in the back by the wine cellar, so it was a bit of a tight squeeze (especially with another large group next to us), but there wasn't much else to complain about. They also have one hell of a wine list.Our waiter was super cool and gave us shots to round out the night.Probably one of the best meals I've ever had. Also, why I came back to the States with none of pants fitting anymore.Make reservations! Either call/email or reserve online. It's a must. Also come hungry, because, they serve a lot of food.This place gets super packed during the dinner rush. Even dining at the counter gets full.I'd recommend the foie gras duo to get the best out of APC. If you're dining with friends, then I'm sure you can taste each other's food. But for a single diner like myself, the foie gras duo comes with Foie Gras burger and foie gras poutine fries. Huge portions for about $50. Very fatty, very rich, and very good.I started off with the tuna tartare as an appetizer, but even though it is a small portion, I couldn't get through my foie gras duo because of the enormity of the portions. The tuna tartare was tarty and fresh.And I still wanted dessert after and I chose the toffee maple milk shake. They made it right in front me...I guess because I was in the counter, but you can see all the fatty goodness when they make this. Not to sweet, but I had enough room to finish it. I would order this again.Trying to find street parking might be hard for you during dinner time. And the metro station is several blocks away. You can probably try the bixi bikes if you have time to roam around this part of the Montreal neighborhood.Drip Drip Drip4 star for food and service but -0.5 star for all the water dripping from the vent on top of my head all through my dinner.Drip Drip Dip I know it was one of the hottest weekend in Montreal.

Foie gras Poutine - must get!! Abundance of extra buttery and fatty foie gras with fries and gravy. This is a heavy dish so great for sharing and having a cold beer. Duck carpaccio - the presentation of the dish was beautiful. Thinly slice duck with chives, raw mushrooms and a yolk. Duck in a can - must get as well! The waiter brings over the can and opens it in front of the table. The content of the can contains the small duck, foie gras, cabbage which is all poured over the bread with carrot purée. The meat was tender and succulent.The service was very good - our waiter was extremely nice and helpful in making suggestions. There are so many options to choose from so it's great if you come with a big group and share everything!This place is insanely delicious.  The restaurant is a bit tight on space but the kitchen is opened. You can actually hear the staff call out orders.  There are so many options that we probably over ordered for two people!! For starters, we had poutine with foie gras, duck carpaccio and beef tongue.  For entrees we had the duck in a can and the blood sausage tart.  The duck in the can was amazing! We totally over did it on the foie gras but you only live once! We had so much foodWe had to call ahead so the restaurant could accommodate our baby.I went with a southern French person to this restaurant but he did not completely agree with my assessment. Just a caveat. :-)We really wanted to try a Montreal special, as this place is very well known. This place has the famous foie gras poutine and Duck in a Can. We decided to all share to try a few more dishes. The baguette is good!The ambience is nice. We went right when it opened and there was a small line waiting. You cannot get seated if you have not made a reservation. Plan ahead. 1. Garden salad: not on the menu, but we figured we were having so many animal parts this was probably a good idea. $15 for generic salad. The salad was fresh but basic. 2. Mushroom risotto: this dish is very expensive for what it is, but you get a show. They come to your table with a large cheese bowl and add the risotto, mushroom, and even Canadian bacon. This dish had potential but was much too salty. It was hard to finish. 3. Terragon Bison tongue: this is tongue well done. The texture is very soft, which is impressive given the quality of most tongues. The sauces and everything just work well together. However, it's game-y so just be warned. 4. Foie gras poutine: loved it. The fries were good. The gravy was also good. The foie gras was in large blocks and was nice and fatty. I think if you come here, you should get this dish! 5. Duck in a Can: I loved watching them pour half a duck out of a can. Life experience. It even looked nice coming out. The duck came out as a thick filet attached to a flap of lard and also fatty liver (foie gras). I enjoyed this dish very much. It was over puréed cauliflower. The issue I had was that the duck meat was very thick. I had to eat it with slices of the lard to complement the taste. Overall a good dish. 6. Dessert: we got the maple cake and the lemon pie. Both were pretty good. Get the maple cake for novelty sake! Very sweet but good flavors. It was a pricy meal, but for a specialty restaurant it made sense.When my friend and I were certain we wanted to try Au Pied de Cochon, I tried to make reservation (1 week in advance) but their voicemail box was full... I didn't know what to do except, trying to call in the following days... And finally, 2 days before the date we wanted to go, I was finally able to make a reservation (but there weren't any tables left, and the lady asked me if it was okay to be seated at the counter/bar, which I was fine with).Being seated at the counter/bar was actually one exciting experience since we were able to watch the chefs cook and take a glance at all the dishes other customers ordered! It was really mind-blowing watching them cook in a fast-moving environment! I really liked their open-kitchen. It was also fun to guess whether the dish was ours or not too (it was our first time at Au Pied de Cochon, so we didn't know what to expect!)Before coming to Au Pied de Cochon, I searched other people's reviews and made my mind that I wanted to try their Duck in a Can! And this was one of the two dishes we ordered. We didn't know what to order next and my friend thought the The PDC Melting Pot has an interesting name, so we ordered that! Our waiter served us bread and butter (we didn't eat a lot since we wanted to save the tummy for our main courses, but the bread was not too hard, it was perfect!)Duck in a Can: Ordered it like I said because a lot of reviews said it is a must there! It is without doubt an interesting and fun dish. It came in a heated can (like how the name of the dish suggested). So, the waiter brought it over and opened it in front of you, poured the content out of the can (which contains the duck breast, 100g of foie gras, cabbages, the sauce) over the bread with carrot and cauliflower purée. The meat was really tender and it went very well with the cabbage, especially when you eat it with a small piece of duck meat. I actually really like the cabbage! It balanced the richness of the duck meat and foie gras very well. The fat under the duck meat was so chewy (I like chewy stuff) but the other fat part was.... I didn't like it since it was too greasy but some people like the feeling of fat melting in the mouth. We finished the dish (expect for the fat part) since it was too much for us.Duck in a can was quite an experience to be honest, it might not be my favorite dish due to its richness and especially oiliness but it was definitely an unique and interesting experience due to the presentation of the dish in a can!PDC Melting Pot:We actually preferred the melting pot because the taste wasn't as heavy as Duck in a Can and the pot was full of surprises, which made it more interesting. This dish came in a pot which was already hinted with its name! There was pork sausages, shiitake mushrooms, buttery potato cheese which was like mashed potatoes with cheese at the bottom, blood sausage -boudin but it is not like the Asian style one-, pork belly (so yummy!), pork loin and onions. There were a lot of things inside the pot; a lots of surprises! I absolutely loved the "buttery potato cheese", it was so delicious and well-made! The pork was tender and everything in this pot went extremely well with the mashed potatoes! The onion sauce was perfect too! It was a rich dish but not overwhelming like Duck in a Can.We also ordered their Milkshake XXX. My thought of my first sip: this is quite sweet... But afterwards, it got better! I don't know what was inside this milkshake... It tasted like rum (I'm not sure if it contained alcohol though). This was one rich milkshake I would say!We were basically in a food coma after this! I would definitely like to come back again and try their bison tongue (saw good reviews about it!)P.S: Make sure to make a reservation!!! Keep on trying even when their voicemail box is full!
