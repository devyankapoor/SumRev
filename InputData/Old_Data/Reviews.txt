"Quite possibly the best pie I've had in my life!", said my friend after eating here (OK it was actually my internal monologue, but my friend did agree that the pie was delicious ;D).I'll admit, I'm new to the concept of pies as a meal, I've always associated pies with dessert.  Ta Pies make delectable meal-pies (I don't know if that's a thing but I'm going to run with it) in many varieties, for omnivores and vegetarians alike.  I really enjoyed the spinach, mushroom, tomato, and Ricotta cheese pie, as well as the curried vegetable pie.  I ordered some meat pies for some friends from work, the steak and mushroom, and the steak, bacon, and mushroom, and they raved about them.  Even I was tempted, based on the pies I had.This spot isn't limited to only pies, though, they also make a variety of desserts, salads, and most importantly milkshakes!  They even have a special one called a "thickshake" which they make with extra scoops of ice cream and a thickening agent.  The regular milkshake was good but damn was the thickshake fine!Ta Pies make single-serving as well as family size pies, and the pies are available hot, refrigerated, or frozen.  If you want to eat in or pick up a hot pie, it's best to call ahead because it takes 20 minutes to heat up, which they will do for you, so you can arrive and the pie will be ready to eat.  Mmmmmmm :DWhat are you waiting for?
Fantastic pies, cakes and croissants. I had the delicious chocolate croissant and the strawberry pie. Oh boy, I can't describe how much I enjoyed the magnificent items from this restaurant. Cream fillings, rich chocolate, crispy shells, smooth and soft. I wish I was still in Montreal to try all the pastries, the other delicacies and items from their restaurant. Surely recommend this place.-SH
australian restaurant in the park avenue dead zone serving authentic australian pies and whatnot? and approved by mister aussie himself, hugh jackman? well, if he says so, must be fucking good! mind you, i've never had their pies so i can't tell but i had some of their desserts and they are indeed good.on the day i went, they had what they call long johns which picked my curiosity. turns out, its a beignet, shaped like a small hot-dog bun, filled with whipped cream and a doll of strawberry jam dead center. sounds and looks appetizing. i didn't pay much attention at first but after having a good look and a decent picture out of it, that's when it hit me. them aussies and their fucking sense of humor!i had one of their other stample, the yo-yo which is a shortbread cookie sandwich with passion fruit butter cream. loved the cream but the shortbread didn't do it for me. i really don't like shortbread cookie as i find them to be dry.while i still need to try their pies, i can say that, dessert wise, its pretty good and worth a try
It's been a long time since i had good meat pies. In fact the last time i had them was in Sydney and in NZ'ed. These are just as good and in fact, better than some I had down-undah!  I had the classic steak and cheese, and the steak bacon and cheese, to dine in.  both so
Now that I have actually spent a year around Oz and NZ, I had to go back here, do a new tasting and update my review accordingly...The pies are not only delicious, they are damn close to the real thing you could find down under and over. Plus, I've finally opened my eyes and noticed that they also sell a bunch of ozzie products... If I ever get a vegemite craving, I now know where to go!
First time having Australian pie like a few Yelpers here. The small $6 butter chicken patty was a crispy, layered, and creamy package, very enjoyable. Mild flavors and not too salty, the way i like it. There are a few Tabasco and srirachas to choose from, but I chose to have mine plain.
Oh my these pies were awesome! They come in a variety of sizes (one serving size for about $6, regular pie-size for about $17, and mini-sizes) and if there aren't any fresh ones still hot in the warmer, there are packaged ones in the fridge. The crust was flaky and the filling was generous and if it wasn't the middle of winter and I wasn't so lazy, I would be headed there now to try more. There are probably about a dozen different pies (including a vegetarian one) and I intend to try all of them! In case it's not obvious, this is not the place for dessert pies. There are a few dessert options (cookies, chocolate, pudding, most of which contain some coconut) but this is a savoury pie place and there are no dessert pies. (I would go to rockaberry for that!!)
Amazing pies, its a must to stop here. The pie crust were very flaky, buttery and soft. It was delicious! They even deliver, which was very convenient for me. Everything was so delicious including the date pudding!
came to try something i never tasted before; the Australian food. Juicy and voluminous pies, lot of choices even vegetarian, special rare desserts, great deal in frozen product. First impression was "tiny", but last impression was "wao I'm really satisfied". its definitely worth to try in your lunch-snack time.
The appearance of this tiny restaurant does not match the big taste of  the food they serve at all...the pie I tried was amazingly delicious, the crust was so buttery and flaky and the veggies filling just perfect. They have a variety of unusual but delicious desserts, I tried the yoyo and it was heavenly....will be back again to try more pies and sweets.
I visited this bakery last summer during our foodie trip through Montreal. I ent in on a whim when we were very hungry. IT BLEW MY MIND! We returned home to Toronto to go on a pie rampage trying to find something close to Ta Pies. Toronto is now going through a aussie pie love phase, 4 restaurants opened in the last year. As delicious as they are, they do not even compare. I can't wait to return to Montreal, not just for the croissants and poutine, but for ta pies.
I'd heard about this place for years but never ventured there for one reason or another. I can't believe I've been missing out on this TASTY TASTY place lo these past 5 years (they recently celebrated their anniversary!).Definitely a niche market but mon dieu it was lovely to sink into a crispy, warm steak and mushroom pie. Heard good things about the curried veg which I'll try next time but really, I'd like to try every single one. They have fresh and frozen varieties and single serving pies from $5.00-6.50 or giant family pies for averaging $15. With a salad or soup on the side it would have been a filling, comforting meal. On it's own a nice, hearty snack!They also have a great selection of sweets including this cake that I was told was Hugh Jackman's favorite when he was in town shooting Wolverine. A very light sponge cake (not too sweet) called a "LAMINGTON" with a bit of jam and dipped in chocolate/coconut. It might sound odd but it was SOOOO GOOD. They also stock 3 different varieties of TimTam cookies (trouble!) and some sweets that I'd never seen before. The sticky toffee pudding with bourbon whipped cream also looked tempting but better on a cold, winter's night...
I got the sweet-potato-curry-vegetarian pie with lentil soup. Both were very delicious. The pie portion looked small, but was actually very reasonable. The lentil soup turned out to be more of a chili (it was so thick we could eat it with a fork), but was nevertheless very flavourful with a touch of spiciness. The other pies were tried were equally as great, with a consistently good crust and tasty fillings. Great place, definitely want to try some desserts next.
Was ok. Not worth going out of way for.
We had sausages, butter chicken and chilli corn carne. One better than the other one. We'll be back!!
Good but the chicken pie's way too rich and the dough wasn't cooked you can still see the butter and too pricy for a tiny pie.
Oooooooh.. I'm a 29yo Australian who hasn't lived there since he was 8, but have visited. So I have a childhood attraction to that Australian taste.I walked in here today after work, next to the park, and was thrilled to see they not only had pies, but Australian products! Vegemite, Cherry Ripe, etc. They also have Lemingtons etc. Which was amazing to find because I usually get people to bring this stuff to me in their suitcases! :)Anyway, my wife and I ordered two pies to eat there, not to go. Mine steak/cheese, and hers a vegetarian. And they were lovely. The pastry was super yummy just like good Aussie pies, and filling was good too. Not exactly the same (not better/worse, just different) but still really nice.I'll definitely stop here every now and then for a casual pie to go as I walk through the park down to Sherbrooke.(Note: Australian pies etc aren't "cuisine" in Australia, they're just a common fast food, like poutine. And it's not so much the pie that is the dish, but more the Australian way of eating it ie: on the go, with a handheld container etc, or at a football game. Either way, there's a special rich taste in them that these guys get right. :))
A few minutes from Parc Jean Mance this place is one of a kind. Special pies based on Aussie and Kiwi staples that you won't find anywhere else in Montreal. They gave a very large selection including vegetarian options and they're all equally delicious. Besides the great pies they also have excellent sweets that you also can't find elsewhere. Perfect for take out or else they have a small terrace on Parc.
Great place for authentic Australian pies!!! Deff recommend you try this place if you're looking for something new... Do it!!!
First time I had australian pies so I have no idea how its supposed to taste like. What I can say is the puff pastry was excellent. But as most British-decent foods, it was bland and greasy. I didnt have the butter chicken pie though, which is apparently one of the best.
Delicious. My daughters love the sausage rolls, I'm partial to the Ned Kelly, though I've tried other flavors and really liked them. My husband finds them too rich, but he's not writing the review so I'll not remove a star for that.
Visited Ta on Wednesday afternoon to grab some comfort food for my girlfriend who is still recovering from surgery.  She wanted to try a meat pie.  Now I know these aren't Canadian style meat pies, but Wolverine said they were legit, and who am I to argue with the most BA X-Man ever?  If I lived in Montreal I would probably eat here every day, I would also probably be obese.  Selection of hot pies was a little limited as it was later in the day, but I was able to pick up two steak and cheese pies, one for me to eat there and one to take back to my girlfriend.  All I can say is, how do we not have these in the states?  The crust was light and flaky and basically melted in my mouth.  For a $6 meal I expected the steak to be tough and not flavorful, I couldn't have been more wrong.  The meat was tender and juicy and the gravy and cheese inside were in perfect proportions.  I complimented my meal with some mushy peas, which I think were good, but as a Yank, have really no idea what they're supposed to taste like.  I grabbed two ANZAC biscuits (they are NOT cookies!) and a lemon/lime and bitters (which was quite refreshing on an 80 something degree afternoon) and hit the road back to the convalescence home.  My lady was equally impressed, though to be fair, she has been eating hospital food for two weeks.  Anyways, this small spot is a must do for a lunch or a quick snack for anyone living or visiting Montreal.  The space is tiny but the service and quality of the food more than made up.  Cheers!
Think small; tiny space, small counters and tables with a few chairs. It's very casual in a depanneur kinda way.So my first suggestion is...maybe go for take out.Now let's talk PIE. I had a buy 1 get 1 free pie coupon which made my meal more even more affordable. If you want in on this deal without the coupon, follow ta-pies on Facebook or Twitter and they'll let you know when this promotion is happening! I bought the curried sweet potato pie, and my friend had the butter chicken pie. It cost us about $6 (including the coupon), which meant I paid only $3...score! At first I thought I might need two pies to fill me up, but when the guy at the counter handed my pie over to me, I was happy to see it was a 'good size'. I'm sorry if I can't really give you the exact circumference, but hey, it was the perfect amount to fill my stomach. I wish my pie was liiiitttle warmer. It wasn't a fantastic pie, but it was tasty. And who can complain for the price?Ta-pies also sells Australian goods at a high mark-up. I didn't get to try any of the desserts, but the coconut and chocolate dipped sponge cake looked a bit sad (and questionable) sitting in the large glass cookie jar on the counter. Anyone have any thoughts about the date pudding or the doughnut? I hope to try those at some point!
Who would have known, a Hawaii boy, all the way in Montreal, eating Australian Meat pies..Found this place from Uncle Anthony from his show. The Layover.This place is a little bit hard to find because the signage is just a picture. Just be on the look out for their logo with the drawing of a head and your at the right place. Parking was a little bit of a pain because they were doing road construction when I went. First off the, the person behind the counter was really really nice, esp when i asked what was popular. She went over the pies that were in the little container on the counter top. She told me what was in every one of them and they all sounded great.I just opted for the meat pie with pieces of meat in side of it. I wasn't sure exactly the name but here is a picture of it.yelp.com/biz_photos/tour…yelp.com/biz_photos/tour…I opt to take it to go because I was just getting food for me and my friend who was back at the Condo. I also did get their popular item which was the Tiramusu..I heated the meat pies for breakfast before we headed to the Grand Prix circuit. I used the oven that was in our Condo and the pies came out great and fantastic. Tasted like they were just freshly baked.My friend who is a really picky eater, enjoyed his meat pie and said it was really good.The Tiramusu was pretty on point too.Over all, fantastic, place and I'll be visiting them again when i'm in MTL.
Very helpful service at the desk and the pies are excellent!  The standard meat (beef) and butter chicken (yes!!) were de-lish.  They even have lamb!  It was a hit with the hubby and the kids.  With a picture of Aussie Hugh Jackman (the Wolverine of X Men) displayed prominently on the wall, what's not to like?Only four stars for the limited seating.
The pies are amazingly good! I've been there with a friend for lunch: even the side dishes are good. Great deals!
Overall :If you eat nothing else on your visit to Montreal, you must try Ta Pies.  Seriously - go out of your way, this place is a gem.Food :My partner had the buttered chicken (sort of a curry chicken flavor) and I had the beef and cheese.  Hers was delicious and really flavorful, mine was excellent.  The crust was buttery and flaky, and the filling was well seasoned with the cheese as an accent rather than an overwhelming element.  My partner lived in Australia for a while and confirmed, these were pretty perfect and totally authentic.  I have never put anything in my mouth that made me this happy.Everything Else :Not much else to say - seating is sparse and mostly outdoors.  Service is counter-style ordering.  Decor... no real impression.  I don't take any stars off for this because Ta Pies is exactly what it seems like - a side of the road pie stand for you to grab a handheld bite and go.  Perfect!
I write all my reviews based on a student budget:Went with a friend and we got two pies for about $14, the veggie one was superb, the beef with cheese was okay. Certainly didn't fill us up so it felt more like an appetizer.
I'm not Australian or a New Zealander which is probably why I don't feel as connected or committed to this store as the others.I do like that they sell Milo (love that stuff) and Vegemite (yes I eat it, and I am not from Down Under)... but the pies were OK. They were well made, and rich and good, but I had a vegan wrap earlier that day and it was much better than the pie (I am drooling to get another  vegan wrap again).. which only tells me that the pie was just OK.I do love me a good puff pastry pie though, but I can make better at home with some President's Choice puff pastry pie and stuff it with chicken thigh meat, veggies and cream.. mmmmmI was actually really looking forward to eating the chicken and mushroom pie but that's a special pie apparently, made once a month. BOO!I would have tried the traditional minced meat pie but I don't eat ground beef any more (*cough*becauseooftheammoniawashingfecesawayfromth­emeat*cough*).Very limited seating, reasonably priced at $6. I'd come back and eat if I was in the area and hungry, but I won't make a special trip out there to eat this once a week.
As an Australian who's been away from home for over a year now Ta Pies was just what I needed to curb some of the home sickness.  I have been back a few times now with my girlfriend who is French-Canadian and she is hooked as well. I think their traditional mince pie is my favourite, but we have sampled quite quite a few of their selection now and they were all delicious. I can say with confidence Ta pies are definitely on the mark with quality and taste. They are equal if not better to a lot of really well known bakeries from my home town in Tasmania.They also have a number of Australian lollies/treats for sale including curly wurlys (my favourite as a kid) Anzac Cookies, Lamingtons, Milo etc.This place is great if you are also in a hurry or need something for dinner later as you can buy refrigerated pies in different sizes to warm up at home.
Who even knew Australian meat pies were a thing?! Well apparently they are, and I couldn't be happier. Ta is tucked away so you might not find it at first, but double back if you miss it, because this place is worth it. They've got everything from traditional ground beef and sausage pies, all the way to Indian dish inspired ones,and each is as good as the next. Plus, for a small extra fee, they'll top any one with a heaping mound of mashed potatoes. So stop by if you can. It's to-TA-lly worth it. I'll show myself out.
They're in NDG now! Imagine the glee when we learned that TA was bringing its pies to Monkland Ave / Girouard!  Villa Maria is the closest Metro stopSo far the pies we've had (as take-out) are:Steak Bacon Cheese. Verdict = DeliciousButter Chicken. Verdict = Oh, Yummy!Spinach, mushroom, tomato & ricotta. Verdict = Vegetarian pies, although tasty and possibly healthy are not the thing of which legends are made. Ned Kelly. Verdict = OMG OMG OMG!While you can easily imagine the first three pies flavour profile you're going to have to try the Ned Kelly. It's a steak pie, with fried egg and cheese and BBQ sauce all in one magical eye-popping pie! Serve any of these pies (except for the vile veggie one) alongside some mushy peas, mashed potatoes and and a cold one and you're golden.They've got big pies to take home and they have little pies that you can eat while you're taking your big pie home. They've really thought of everything.
Amazing pies! Even more delightful desserts!!!The pies are pre-made and reheated prior to serving, the fillings are generous, tasty, and the pie crusts are mind-blasting.I really love the concept of having desserts in a cup, very convenient for on-the-go. I had the Sherry Trifle, and wish there was slightly less alcohol; not too sweet and the texture was perfect.A real hidden gem in Montreal, wish more people knew about this place!
I was looking for somewhere to have tourtiere in Montreal, and this restaurant came up.  It's a pretty small restaurant, and pretty casual. It took me a few minutes to find this restaurant, but I tend to get lost easily, especially when traveling. I got the basic beef. The filling was delicious and savoury, and the pastry was nice and flaky. I'll have to keep this restaurant in mind for the next time I'm in Montreal. It was well worth the stop.
Like Hugh Jackman said, the best meat pies hands down amazing! Loads of flavors to choose from including a couple of veg options take home heat yourself options and the BEST sausage rolls you will ever eat! Amazing desserts you won't find these anywhere else in montreal probably Canada for that matter. Do yourself a favor give Ta a try they also have a food truck at the Olympic stadium first Friday's event during the summer
Brought home a steak, bacon and cheese large "family" sized pie and was pleasantly surprised how good it was!  First of all the crust was so crisp, buttery and tasty!  Seriously.... I usually eat minimal crust on a meat pie as I find it so tasteless and hard to swallow (without a big glass of milk)!  This crust tasted like having a croissant for the crust!  The filling inside had wonderful flavour and was not too dry and well portioned with sauce.  Flavour was fa-dabulous!  I did however think the pricing was a tad high for a frozen pie ($16.50 per large)!  I believe it's a bit of a rip-off to charge the same price for fresh as frozen but that's my "cheap prairie upbringing"!  I would like to try some of their other pies and deserts but wanted to try one out to see if it was the real-deal!  It sure is folks!  On my next trip I would like to try Butter Chicken, Rogan-Josh and possibly a Tiramisu!  I'll update after I chomp down on one or all!  I have never had an Australian meat pie but these may rank up there with the best dinner pies I've eaten!
Hungry for Australian cuisine? Then you better make your way here!It's a small little shop near the park. A friend did research where to eat and find this place! Ta Pies is great for all things pies and desserts! They sell Australian products like Tim Tam (the best!), Vegemite, Milo, etc. They also have Tim Tam Homemade ice cream which is divine! Best thing ever created. So, friends and I were there to take out and bring back to our hotel. The lovely lady at the counter said a whole pie would take 35 minutes to be ready, which was fine with us. She was very nice and explain to us what each pie was and what tim tams were and how to eat them (even though I already knew). After 10 minutes of deciding, or what felt like 10 minutes, we got a spinach and cheese pie. The place is quite small, you can eat inside or outside on the patio. We went to the park that was a block away instead of waiting inside the shop. I think she was waiting for us cause the pie was under the heat lamp. She gave us a bag, plates, and forks. Onto the actual food tasting, the crust looked so crumbly with buttery goodness! It was great. It was definitely a different type of dough crust that I'm used to. It wasn't flaky, but it a couple layers. I really liked it. Lots of filling to go with it too. Very filling.
Their flaky pies with various sauces with tender chunks of meat (beef, lamb, etc.) were so good indeed. Though we didn't try a well-known Australian dish, "the floating pie," a meat pie floating on green pea soup, out of ignorance - next time for sure, we tried Lamington cake!! There are a few descriptions on the historical origins of Australian street food items on the wall, interesting read.If you visit Tourtière Australienne, you can find various kinds of meat pies with different sauces in two size: mini and 6 inches. Also, they sell frozen pies which were not cooked yet, so just pop them in the oven! (nice to bring a couple of them for Sunday family dinner!)Don't forget to taste their scrumptious homemade desserts as well :)
Ces petites tourtières sont bien savoureuses. J'ai essayé celle à l'agneau au cari et aussi celle au steak et fromage. La salade était fraîche. Il y a un grand choix de tourtières et les desserts ont l'air très bons. Le service est rapide et sympathique. Côté ambiance, c'est petit et le décor n'a vraiment rien d'extraordinaire, mais il y a une terrasse qui donne sur l'avenue du Parc, où nous avons mangé. C'était agréable, car en soirée la rue n'est pas extrêmement passante. ---These little meat pies are tasty. I tried the lamb and curry and also the steak and cheese pies. Salad was fresh. There's a wide variety of meat pies, and desserts look good. Service is fast and friendly. The place is small and the decor is too basic, but there is a patio outside by Avenue du Parc, where we ate. It was nice because the street is not too busy at night.
Their sweet potato curry pie is amazing and you have to get the Tam Tam ice cream! Thinking about the place makes me drool.
Being Australian its hard not to have mixed expectations for a pie shop selling Aussie cuisine.Aussie pies are hard to beat and TA succeeds fairly well at nailing the Aussie meat pie. There is a wide variety of flavours many of which I have never seen in oz like Butter Chicken but still taste amazing whilst nailing the flaky pastry. We purchased the Steak, Bacon and Cheese; Butter Chicken and the Shephards pie varieties. I enjoyed them all although my bf was a little disappointed with the shephards pie.TA also sells a variety of Aussie desserts including Pavlova and Rum Balls. I decided to purchase a Tim Tam Meringue which I was fairly disappointed in as the whole pie crust was burnt and quite hard to bite into so I wouldn't recommend purchasing them.Overall it is a fairly good representation of some typical Aussie food that can be a little expensive at $5-6 for a pie but well worth a try if just to get my Aussie food fix.
One of my favourite places to go for a quick bite to eat. They also make a large assortment of frozen pies which are great for taking home and eating later. I highly recommend this place. They have vegetarian pies and meat pies, and their desserts are also excellent.
DELICIOUS & AUTHENTIC! I stopped by TA on the way to the park and was pleasantly surprised, actually impressed. Anyone familiar with New Zealand and Australian meat pies will have high expectations, like I did, when seeing a sign outside this semi-whole-in-the-wall spot advertising meat pies. TA delivered ... very hot and very fresh, which is the opposite of a complaint, just difficult to wait for it too cool sufficiently before eating. The pastry crust was PERFECT and the fillings delicious.    The space is small, very small, and definitely not a dinner destination or for a meal of any great length. I'll reiterate, if you're familiar with how things work in NZ and Australia and how to order and eat meat pies, there's no surprises aside from being 100% satisfied with the food. I'll be back ... soon
We had the spinach, mushroom, tomato and ricotta pie, which looked like the only meatless pie they had that day (it was our last day in Montreal, and we were cramming our morning fulfilling our munchies on all kinds of fatty goods, so, we decided to go light. I would've loved to try the curry meat pie though). It is pretty good; I like it with ketchup on top, but they have other condiments on the side for you before you sit down in one of their high chairs (there are only a couple tables). It's cute how they are like a mini emporium of authentic Australian foods.
I may be biased since I'm Australian, but Aussie pies such as those made by TA beat any other pies made in la belle province. Their fillings are juicy and their crust sufficiently crisp and easy to break into without leaving that dry taste in your mouth. I've tried their classic meat pies, the vegetable curry, and the beef and mushoom. They're all good. I just wish that the pies were bigger because one is definitely not enough for a meal. For a more authentic feel, have your pies with mash and gravy on top. It's fun to eat and tastes wonderful. The place is tiny, so go there on a nice sunny day and enjoy your pie at Jeanne-Mance park.
Small pie place you can easily miss on Parc.There are a few seats inside but I usually buy frozen pies and enjoy them at home.I have lived in Australia for 4 years and these pies are even better than most pies I had there. I've been buying the pies there for nearly 2 years and I have never been disappointed. Great choice too (meat, vegetarian).They also sell other Aussie classics like Vegemite & Tim Tams.Definitely worth trying!
As an Australian I was excited to find this gem when visiting Montreal. And wow it did deliver! I left feeling like I'd been back home for a little while. Here's why:- I had the classic beef pie, and possibly the best meat pie I've ever had. The pastry was amazing and surpassed that of pastries in Australia, perhaps the french influence. Tomato sauce and some Australian brand chutneys were freely available.- My boyfriend noted the pies are surprisingly filling for $5-6 each.- They can show you how to do a Tim-tam slam, for those interested in Aussie culturalisms.- They offer 'lemon lime and bitters', an Aussie mixer drink that trust me, is pretty hard to find in north America.- The girl at the counter has worked as a barista in Australia, and the quality of the coffee really reflects this.- The traditional sticky date pudding was great, but difficult to chose from the several dessert options including pavlova and Tim-tam tiramisu.- When buying a take-home pie for later, I noticed the bill pleasantly reflected that advertised prices included tax - not sure if this was the same for our eat-in meal. The take-home pie was also amazing.This place will be on my radar for every time I return to Montreal, and really shouldn't be missed. If you're an expat missing home, or interested in seeing what real Australian food is, this place is a must.
Woohoo!  As good as it gets!OK firstly, this was my first time going to a tortiere shop/restaurant.  Secondly, these are the best damned pie crusts you'll find anywhere.Thirdly, the filling (I've only had butter chicken) was shockingly good.  There isn't an Indian anywhere on premises, but that butter chicken was kickin'.  Excuse the rhyme.My friend got the cookie that I'd bought but forgotten in his glove compartment, and he swore that, like the pies, that cornflakes and chocolate cookie was maybe the best cookie he's ever eaten!  I wouldn't say it's a place with good food - I'd say it's a place that you should absolutely eat at if you get the chance.  This is not regular good.  It's unique good.
I love me a Kiwi pie & flat white! We discovered this place a week after our trip to New Zealand, and we have not looked back. It's a great place to get a mince pie, or my favourite a mince and cheese. The business is run by a husband(Don) and wife(Melanie). Don having been a professional chef in New Zealand and later Australia,met Melanie and they married and moved to Montreal. The pies made using local ingredients, and come very very close to the pies of Russel or Lake Taupo NZ!They have a large variety of pies that you can take home frozen. Either individual or family size.  Often they have specials, such as a pie of the week or a baker's dozen promotion. The frozen pies also transport very well. Putting them in a cooler bag or small cooler box we were able to give some to my cousin in Calgary who married a Kiwi. He gave his approval of them. They also make great flat whites, and are not too expensive.On weekends Don will usually have a rugby or Aussie rules football game on the TV.In the summer time they have a pie eating contest - I believe the current record is 8.5 pies in ten minutes.
I've got to say that these are theeee best Australian pies I have ever had! 2 VEGETARIAN OPTIONS!!????Say What!?!Make sure to try the Curry as well as the Spinach Ricotta pie. They are both amazing.They were also one of the few places that were open at 10 am on Labor Day. Go figure. I envy those of you who get to eat here whenever you want... I have to drive 6 hours to get here.
I love the food here! I am particularly fond of the butter chicken meat pie, coupled with a ginger beer. One of my favourite places in Montreal!
Every time we visit Montreal we absolutely have to visit Tourtiere Australienne.  This cozy and casual gem of a place has a chef who has mastered the art of buttery flaky pastry. Individual pies look small but pack so much goodness and are surprisingly filling.  The only problem is which delicious pie to choose....mmm... butter chicken, steak and mushroom, spinach/ricotta, lamb roganjosh, and their breakfast pies are absolutely mouth watering.  To top it off,  their pavlova with whip cream, topped with fruit is divine!  Dine in or take it to go.  They are located near a couple of parks, so having an impromptu New Zealand/Aussie style picnic is a delightful way to enjoy this authentic grub.The young couple who own and run the place are very sweet and welcoming .  She is Quebecois and we expeciallly enjoyed hearing her speak english to us in her Australian/French accent.Pass the tomato sauce, listen to some tunes from "Down Under", fill your belly with gourmet food VERY inexpesively, and leave with your very own jar of Vegemite.  Ta!
I love me some pies.  Sweet, savoury, as long as there is golden, buttery, flaky crust and something delicious inside, I'm on board.  I first discovered this place on a tip from my old chef at a resto I worked at in the neighbourhood and popped in to check it out; pies that are of Australian nature?  Is this for realsies?In any case, I was greeted by a couple of flags (Australian and New Zealand, in particular) and a chipper Québecoise with a ridiculous, err, "Australian" accent.  She steered me towards an OG pie (Steak and Kidney) as well as a couple of newer ideas (Butter Chicken and Spinach with Ricotta) and I was promptly satisfied upon gobbling them down.  Over the proceeding weeks I managed to try all of their offerings and was never let down.  The crust is perfectly balanced and buttery and the fillings are always fun and delectable.As an added bonus, they also sell the pies frozen so you can stock up for the winter months (October - June).
Meat pies were one of the highlights of our trip to Australia/New Zealand. The only disappointment we had in discovering this place is that we didn't find it earlier
Being from the Midwest of the USA, I hadn't had a lot of experience with meat pies until moving to Montreal.  But after some family dinners and a few visits to Tourtiere Australienne, I'm hooked.Ambiance:  The restaurant has a simple but straightforward layout.  The interior has seating for about about 12 and also functions as a shop for patron to grab some pre-made pies.  There is room for about 10 people to sit outside if weather permits.   The pies of the day sit in a warmer near the register ready for your selection.Food:  They had about 8 different varieties to choose from, including both meat and veggie options.  I had a meat-heavy pie that included some bacon and was not disappointed.  My dining companion let me sample her veggie filled choice which was also very tasty.  The pie's crust was light, flakey and delicious.  We tried to counterbalance the meat pie with one of TA's green salads and were pleased as well.Service:  TA is a pretty casual place to grab a bite.  The woman who took our order also brought out the pies/salad in a timely and kind fashion.Price:  Dinner for two was ~$25, which is reasonable for a quick dinner in Montreal by my standards.We'll be back at TA and look forward to grabbing a few pies to take home to our freezer as well.
This is one of those awesome restaurants that comes into your life just as you're looking for something different. Their pies are incredible, with savoury filling and perfectly flaky crust and their desserts are just as great, really inspired creations. I usually go for the 3-for$40 deal on the family-size pies and a few highlights are definitely the green chili thai chicken pie, the butter chicken pie and the chili con carne. The sweet potato curry and classic potato top get honourable mentions, too. Finishing off the meal with a TimTam Tiramisu adds something really unique and decadent to the whole experience, too. If you've never been, go!
I missed the flavours of meat pies and sausage rolls from New Zealand where I spend 2 of my high school years there. The gravy and the pastry just reminded the days where I spend my youth days. Must try this if you think most North American pies are mediocre and too sweet!
Tourtière Australienne specialises in Australian/New Zealand style savoury meat pies, sausage rolls and pasties.  There is usually a selection of varieties to choose from, ready-to-eat, either eat-in or to go.  Pies can also be bought frozen (in small or "family" sizes to heat at home).  The great thing about this shop is that these pies really are the "real thing", tasty and made with extra-flaky buttery pastry.  I sampled the steak, steak & cheese, and smoked fish pies, and all were excellent.  Service was friendly and helpful, and the shop has a nice, informal feel (they even play Australian music).  They also stock "Tim-Tams", a kind of chocolate biscuit.  However, the selection is limited to the original kind.  Notably absent are the other delicious varieties available in Australia, in particular the dark chocolate flavour!
I had the Butter Chicken Pie and Corn Flake cookie and lets just say I am counting down the days for my return. The pastry was flaky, the butter chicken was nicely flavored, from the first bite I wanted more! The cookie was was just AMAZING not to sweet but sweet enough and the taste of the corn flakes complemented the chocolate perfectly. Next time I bring home some frozen Pies and a dozen cookies for sure. Please keep up the great cooking, you mad me a fan!!!!!!!
I have passed this little gem walking to and from work for quite some time and never gave it a second thought until yesterday when I did a quick yelp search and saw all the great reviews.  I decided to try it for myself and am glad I did.  WOW!  I called and spoke to a very nice woman who helped me narrow down my order.  I got the family size Butter Chicken and Curry Veg.  My family and I enjoyed every bite.  I do recommend calling early as I believe they may run out of certain pies before closing.
Nice little restaurant. Can't really comment on how Aussie they really are, since I've never even been to Australia, but the pie was tasty. Sold cold, warm or frozen for take home.
Not the best meat pies out there, but they're pretty decent. They're great to take away and eat on the mountain.Don't get conned into buying the Tim Tams from here, though, because you can get them for half the price at Loblaws!
Good chef-not just any old pie.  Very nice desserts.  Chef has real talent, and this is a must go for a cheap delicious meal.
I was soooo excited when we found this place, after a recent trip to Australia I had been craving a decent meat pie, but alas! They are no where to be found in Boston. These meat pies are a little different, pretty much more upscale versions of the ones found at every bakery in AU. They were phenomenal, flaky crust, top notch ingredients, and a wide selection for every taste.  Needless to say I will make a stop or two here on any visit to Montreal!
Great pies. Friendly staff. Try the rum balls as well awesome
So many varieties of gourmet meat pies, and so tasty! The service was great and the outdoor patio was a nice place to enjoy the meal. There were deserts, but I can't imagine using any room in my stomach for anything but the pies.
Dépanneur le Pick-Up is one of my favorite places in Montreal of all times for so many reasons, part of those reasons being that there's no other place like it in the city. It's located on a quiet residential street and attracts literally every single type of person from hipster to gangster and everything in between. It's a cross between a good old dep and a diner, with a zine rack and an array of weird knick-knacks.  The coffee is really good and so is the food. Also, le Pick-Up takes the cake for best pulled-pork sandwich I've ever tasted. Worldwide. Yep.**It's always packed so be prepared to wait for your food. Lots of outdoor seating in the summer time so you can enjoy a coffee while you wait.
There is nothing like the pick up. Nothing. Go there. Now. Eat everything. Best drip coffee ever. I live nearby specifically to eat here more. I bring all my friends and out of town guests here. I always make a bet "if you don't love it, I'll pay" -- I've never lost.
I loved the green salad (misnomer - lots of color), the Chipotle Club Sandwich - substantial and tasty. I tasted 4 of the sweets all yum! As much a treat as the handsome young man serving was to my eyes. My friend had the Steak sub and enjoyed it immensely. I bought a Tom Green Milk beer and McKeon Sparkling Cranberry Cider (to be savoured likely this weekend) .Enjoyed the curios which had me flashing back to my childhood and the contrast of gourmet gourmande vibe of the micro brews & assortment of organic eatz & drinks.
This gem has now become widely known in Montreal. But despite being more mainstream, they have definitely kept their hipster roots. This is a perfect place to grab a sandwich to go or enjoy it on their terrace on a summers day. I highly recommend the grilled halloumi cheese sandwich as well as the vege pulled pork. Both are unique and spectacular. Also notable are their baked goods and homemade lemonade.
A classic of the Mile-end, let us hope that they continue to serve pulled pork in unpretentious surroundings well into the future.
Love it. This is a depanneur in the mile ex area that doubles up as a restaurant but I think most people come for the food. I've ordered from both their breakfast and lunch menus. Never been disappointed. Service is always excellent and unassuming. As for the food, I love their beef burgers, chipotle club, potatoes and quinoa salad. There is a daily menu that varies from day to day. They also have amazing lattes and desserts. This place tends to get busy during meal times so be prepared to wait or to order for takeout.
Very cute/cool place.  I was at Stade Uniprix for tennis (Rogers Cup) and instead of eating there, we decided to take a short walk to find some REAL food.  So glad we did!  We would've never come here otherwise!  Delicious sandwiches for under ten bucks.  We tried the special of the day (Cuban), the pulled pork, and the steak sub.  Yummy!!!Lots of seating outside so hang out for awhile.  Do expect to wait a bit for your food as it is being prepared to order.
This little unassuming neighbourhood spot serves some great sandwiches! They are a small little grocery shop with limited indoor seating and a patio. The sandwiches areade to order and they're busy. The orders kept coming in while I was waiting for mine and it wasn't even during peak hours. The halloumi was good; loved the squeaky cheese and the flavors. Hubby had the steak and said it was great.
Amazing faux pulled pork. Sweet and tucked away and cheap but high quality food and don't tell but they totally have $1.25 bottomless drip coffee. If they only had more seating I'd bring 10 friends at once! But you're right in the dep, which is equal parts of charming and annoying.
Tried the burger, steak sous marine & pulled pork!!! All very delicious. Cookies are to die for
My mechanic suggests I wait the hour at "a cool dep/café down the street". Dubious about what "cool" means to him.... Well Hello Dolly!!!  Hello Twilight Zone Pit-stop Heaven!  Vintage dépanneur with diner counter & sweet terrace. Understated, wholesome neighbourhood secret sweet spot. Good people, doing good things, in a great way.
i know the place is freaking awesome! i love the place but i always forget to review it. maybe its because i want to keep it to myself. well, free of tourists ;pplace is a diner that looks like the kind of place you'd drive by in the nevada desert or on your way to mexico city. or maybe the kind of place guy fieri would go to. you know, a hole in the wall that does good food.so, i've had their faux pulled pork, that turkey sandwich, the good old cold cut sandwich either on bread or croissant, their lamb burger week entry and probably other items i'm forgetting.besides the lamb burger that somehow got dried, the rest are that good!the faux pulled pork needs no introduction besides its one messy sloppy delicious sandwich. see, vegetarian food doesn't have to taste like they just harvest it and rinse it under water.. the faux pork is made with jackfruit. i know the recipe but haven't been able to find water brine jackfruit instead of the syrup one you find at most asian grocery stores..as for the turkey sandwich, its like that christmas store in old montreal. holidays all year long! what's not to love? those christmasy flavor together in your mouth *drool*no comment on the cold cut sandwich. its a good old plain cold cut sandwich. simple yet satisfying.besides the food, there's the dep part of the place with the regular fare you can find at most convenient store except that it carries better and most definitely healthier food related items.don't let the place turn you away. it may sound like a hipster place but its really not. you'll meet all kind of people depending on the day and time of your visit.
Best place in the world. The food is ridiculous. Unique and delicious. If you like sweets get the lemon squareThere's a super cute terrasse out backAlthough tables are a little hard to come by as it getsPretty busyStaff is great, good is great, definitely one of my favourite spots to eat
Hells yes to the faux pulled pork sandwich! The only real issue with being a vegetarian is that I always feel left out while my friends have a big meaty paw of a sandwich and I am stuck with what looks like cat food from a tin can smooshed between two lame pieces of bread. Thanks to Le Pick-Up, I too can now have a huge 'meaty' sandwich in my paw! The chipotle mayo and banana peppers provided a nice kick and the bread was perfection: toasted and delicious. My meat-eating lunch mate couldn't get over the texture of the tofu, said it was exactly like real porc. The staff here are friendly and fun, the tunes were cranked and we scored a picnic table right by the door. I love this place! Bonus: the cookies and lemon bars are divine and they have a huge range of condoms available...why? Who knows, but hey, you can never be too careful!
Nice joint! Take the best-selling pulled pork sandwich and you will be satisfied! It's nice, juicy, fresh and has an amazing taste! I would recommend to take home potatoes as side dish. After taking this lunch you will be thinking  about a nap :-)
The pulled pork sandwich is awesome. I've tried a couple of pulled pork sandwiches all over the US and surprisingly, this place takes the cake. Well balanced with pickles, mayo, pickled banana peppers and cole slaw...crunchy yet airy bread...It was great. The Pick-Up also sells a small variety of ginger beers, which was a big plus for me / a wonderful surprise. If you're in this neighborhood, you MUST try it out. Plus this place is a stone's throw from Jean Talon market, I recommend visiting both in a single outing.Price: $7.50
As long as you don't mind feeling like the hipster you know you are, dear Yelp reader, this place is awesome. We were staying in the old town and Ubered out to this place for lunch because we had heard good things. It was well worth it. Awesome pulled pork sandwich, awesome hallumi sandwich, awesome lemonade and pleasant seats outside. Lots of talk at the table next to us about getting some "studio time" to "lay down some tracks", so in addition to having really good sandwiches, Le Pickup must also be really cool.PS, there's a bike station right next to the shop.
Wow! Everything was fantastic--it may be an off-beat location, but definitely worth the effort.
Great neighbourhood joint. We keep going back and back. I've had many things on the menu, and it's always good. Great service, great atmosphere and great food.The veggie pulled pork sandwich is a dream. My favourite sandwich in the world. I get cravings for it, I go, and am never disappointed. Please note that I'm not a vegetarian, and still prefer the veggie option. It's just so good. Oh, and they'll serve it on corn tortillas if you want to switch it up sometime.
one of the best casual brunches out there. delicious, cheap, friendly and fun. they're happy to turn anything veggie or vegan if you ask, but the pulled pork is famous. love the sunny terrace!
Are you a vegetarian? Do you like delicious sandwiches? Of course you do. Go here. Eat all the sandwiches. Veggie pulled pork. Grilled Halloum. Breakfast sandwich with veggie ham.I'm sure it's delicious if you're a meat eater too, but I don't care about that.Bonuses - cute atmosphere. lovely staff. also a dep, for all your snack/beer/minor household needs.
On my first day in Montreal, having done my research, I dragged my resident friend to Le Pick Up.Oh. My. Goodness.Admittedly, I've been a vegetarian for most of my life and as such have never eaten pulled pork before. I'm not really sure what it's supposed to taste like, but if it tastes anything like the incredible faux pulled porc I had here, then I certainly understand the hype. It was so sweet, sour, tangy and spicy. Amazing flavours and perfect crusty bread at a good price. Not to mention, babely eye candy behind the counter taking your order and serving up the goods. The tables outside are a lovely addition to this kitschy neighbourhood deps.I will definitely be back here before my trip to Montreal is over.
Le Pick Up (a very artsy deps in Montreal) is my target for lunch today! Well-received Faux (veggie "porc") pulled pork is a must-eat here! Awesome! I have never eaten a vegetarian pull pork, replacing pork with chinese vegetarian bean-curd to allow for the shredding pulled pork texture! Then topped with tangy and spicy sauce, caraway seeds, pepper, preserved pickle, sweet chili, jalapeño, caramelized onions, vinegary slaw stuffed high between 2 slices of chewy bun! It's a mammoth, my $6.75 was well spent! Service is prompt but expect to wait for 15 minutes to get your items whipped up on a weekend. They even send us a bottle of ice water with clean cups while waiting at the empty communal table, so thoughtful! I guess the heat wave is driving me crazy these days in Montreal but nothing beats this crazier yummy creation by Le Pick-up.The inner space is a little cramped but the patio has a couple of dining tables and seats as well as in the "secret garden" at the backyard. I saw a stairway leading to a second level which I do not know if another dining hall exist? The place is just full of artsy vibes!!!!  If you are looking to get some cookies, condiments, canned items, they have a few on the shelve, I am seeing my fave maple cookies that I almost sweep it into my bag! I now figured why they are called dépanneur, because they started out as a convenient store! Cool!!
One of my two favorite breakfast/brunch/lunch places in Little Italy. When I go, I often get the veggie pulled pork (AMAZING, and tastes almost identical to their meat version), but have tried many different things, all consistently good. The breakfast crepes are delish. Its just a really good place for breakfast or lunch, lots of outdoor seating in the summer, and a great atmosphere. They keep it real with good vibes.
Awesome food from a converted retro dep hidden away in a quiet side street near Little Italy. Vegetarian pulled pork sandwich is sublime. Staff are super friendly and interesting.
You know how heroin addicts always need their next fix? Well, I kind of feel that way about Le Pick-Up's faux pulled "porc". It is seriously the most glorious thing sandwiched between two buns. I am actually salivating as I write this and cannot wait until the next time I sink my teeth into it's edible deliciousness. The best part is that it's not tofu that they use but jack fruit for their "porc". Where they find jackfruit, I'm not sure. One day I will take the time out of my day to find out but for now I depend on Le Pick-Up for my fixture. The staff is always friendly and they have fridges full of cool drinks like Curiosity Cola and what not. I like Boylan's Ginger Ale which they keep in stock. I could shower in it.There are other sandwiches as well, but unfortunately I know nothing about them so its for you to find out. One of my friends swears by their tuna sandwiches and it runs out fast so best go early if you wanna dig into this fish sandwich.Side note: A lot of people think the faux pulled "porc" is vegan but there is mayo in this sandwich so its best to skip the sauce if you wanna keep it "ethical" for all you vegans out there.
Co-owned by Bernadette Houde aka Bernie Bankrupt of the seminal Montreal electro act Lesbians on Ecstasy and Penny Patterson, this chill corner store / diner seats about 30 in the summer and 8 in the winter, serves what is perhaps the world's best veggie pulled pork, stocks a great selection of organic snacks and hand-stapled zines, and continuously reinvents itself as a multi-purpose art experience.

Went today for lunch after hearing very good reviews from friends. It did not disappoint. I had the special which was a lemongrass beef sandwich with Kim-chi. It was so good! my friend had the pulled pork that looked really awesome. Although, I've REALLY thirsty ever since. The atmosphere is very laid-back casual but clean. Waiters were great. Very friendly and checking up with us often to make sure everything was good.I will definitely go back again.
Wonderful.  I was enchanted at once the first time I walked in here upon sight of the inexplicable gigantic toothbrush.  This is in fact a depanneur, but they have a sweet little kitchen to pump out delicious meaty (or not) savory meals.  Upon sampling every sandwich on the menu (not in the first visit) I'd have to say that the winner is a tie between the Club Chipotle (club sandwich with chipotle sauce) and the Post-Reveillon (turkey and cranberry!).  Of the two times I had the pulled pork, it unfortunately varied.  My first was not nearly moist and flavorful as it should have been, yet the second time (when Beaver was in the kitchen) it was deeeelicious and perfect.  My plate was a mess and I licked it clean.  In public.I have as of yet to try the soups nor the salads, but I surely will sometime soon.A solid place for cheap and filling eats to show your out of town friends a little slice of Trouvé-seulement-à-Montréal" dining or just to meet up with local friends for a delightful bite.  Nice and hidden so the dummies from McGill can't find it as it's located outside of the McGill "Ghetto."
i live for places like this and if there was one in my neighborhood I would go there every day. It's an eatery hidden inside a convenience store with a fresh, delicious, and inexpensive menu. Try the 'pulled porc' and you will not be disappointed. Downsides: seating is limited, wait times are long, and it's best to bring cash but the food is worth it. You're welcome.
Just wanted to say thank you for having a booth set up at Osheaga. A place where apparently not eating meat is the hugest imposition ever.  I couldnt do another pizza cone or overpiced dagwood sandwich by the third day and you guys saved me. The vegetarian pulled pork was my first time trying fake pulled pork but it was great. I dug the extra stringy/chewy texture since most fake meat isn't as "hearty." The bun and dressings also added a nice presentation to it. It felt like I was eating a super manly and substantial sandwich, which is not often something you get when ordering vegetarian sandwiches. (see: every place that has a "vegetarian" option which means scattered un-seasoned roasted vegetables on a piece of bread.)
Best pulled pork in the city, hands down - including the vegetarian version, which is delicious! They also make a fantastic iced coffee and have a super charming little patio in the back, which is the perfect place to spend a sunny Saturday morning. The kind of amazing in-between place that makes me adore Montreal. Just don't all go swarming the place, because this is my favourite neighbourhood spot!
This is Le Pick Up's claim to fame. Slow roasted pulled pork sandwich in barbecue sauce, served with grilled peppers, coleslaw on a Portuguese style bun. REALLY tasty. Straight up. There was a certain zing to the barbecue sauce and it was complimented perfectly with the crunchy slaw directly in the sandwich. All it was missing was fries and they could have called it a "Po'Garçon".
Lunchtime might be busy here but I enjoy the hustle and bustle of sitting at the counter and chatting with the chef while watching my food being made. Once you're a regular here, you'll get treated like family. Try the powermade in the summer: a delicious homemade hibicus iced tea, or try one of the best iced coffees in town (add your own sugar and milk! tasty espresso! ) During the week, if Michael made the soup of the day, always order it, he's amazing at it. Best breakfast sandwich ever: your choice of ham, bacon, cheddar or veggie ham, a fried egg, your choice of bread (including corn tortillas) lettuce, tomato, mayo- but they'll always let you add things for a few extra cents (i say do bacon AND cheddar, make the mayo chipotle and add hot peppers). This place is loud but friendly- if you're in town and you don't know anybody, here are some very sweet and funny people who will make you feel like you're among friends.
Hidden, Tasty and Friendly.
Yum, stop by this place to pick up some delicious pulled pork sandwiches on your way to/from the market.  So good.
Amaaaazing! Cute little family owned Cafe...and the hosts and food and patrons everyone's super amazing! Try the Mexican omelette!
Loved the atmosphere and energy of this place. We just went out and picked this place because it was close by the condo that we rented. They have a combo where you can get a breakfast smoothie and a breakfast sandwich for 10 bucks. I got a mango, banana smoothie and a veggie breakfast sandwich. The menu is in French, and the waitresses speak on French, Portuguese, and English so that is convenient.
Jason L and I had our last breakfast in Montreal here. We arrived, rather despondent about the prospect of the long way home. We left, properly caffeinated, with full bellies, and perhaps a little bit cheerier. Things of note:1. The breakfast list is limited: They have a full Portuguese breakfast (eggs, chorizo, bread), a delicious chicken/avocado sandwich, pastries and the like. 2. I highly recommend the chicken, cheese, and avocado sandwich. The chicken is thinly sliced and spicy- and pairs well with the homemade hot sauce they provide. Despite it's small size, it is also very filling.3. They do not have "drip" coffee, only espresso drinks. If you ask for a "regular coffee" (meaning drip) the server will become annoyed and/or confused. Several groups of American tourists, ours included, were greeted with death stares for questioning the greatness that is an Americano. 4. They are cash only. They do not have an ATM on sight. The closest ATM is two blocks away in an often closed convenience store- so come prepared!5. Seating is a bit tight - especially when it is busy. The cafe probably only holds 20 people tops. 6. The food and cafe drinks are reasonably priced - think $1.50 Canadian for an Americano. 7. I should note- that I server spoke English- which was helpful considering my abysmal French. A word to a wise however-   attempting to speak French - will at least endear you a bit more to folks. Aggressively speaking English at the beginning of a conversation is rude.Cafe Jose is a perfect place to go when you finally get sick of all the French/Quebecois food you've gorged yourself on all week.
Chez Jose is a quaint little shop with a charming menu. The service is quick and filled with smiles. I tried the cafe au lait which was absolutely wonderful and paired perfectly with a fresh apple turnover (YUM). Would recommend for just a yummy pastry to go or a sweet catch up with a friend. Definitely going back.
I am just so happy that this place exists. The food is amazing, the atmosphere is wonderful, the prices are great. The seafood soup is my favourite thing on the menu. For just $6, you get a big hot bowl of happiness with a healthy serving of mussels and a lovely piece of bread on the side. The seafood soup is only offered Friday through Sunday I believe.So what if you go on another day of the week, and there's no soup? Or you want something to go along with the soup? (I ordered crepes + soup once, that was waaaaaay too much food. The soup serving is quite generous). You can go sweet or savoury, or since things are pretty cheap, do both. I'm a big fan of the crepes (about $8) - one order gets you two! Chez Jose is pretty well known for its churrasco sandwich (chicken and avocado), which I think is good and delicious but not amazing. They also have a lot of different smoothies. I would highly recommend having brunch, lunch, or an early dinner at Chez Jose. It's not a huge place, so I don't think you want to go in a group bigger than 4. Go alone  or go with a friend, you won't regret it. The restaurant/cafe is also beautiful - nice windows, hippie-ish but unpretentious casual vibe.(Note, bring cash, though there's an ATM nearby)
very nice food. ten bucks to hv seafood soup and sandwich. Yummy and happy. A nice place to hv dinner by myself.
This is one of my favourite places in Montreal! His sandwiches are amazing .. All the soups are  great And everything is homemade! The homemade pastries are delicious ! Raspberry & Almond   The omelet & sandwiches are a must try!!! Recommend this place 100% Not very fancy place but the food is completely worth it !!
I've been eating here for years and the prices have been creeping up (from insanely reasonable) but it is still a great deal. And the food is always awesome. I can't speak for the whole menu as I tend to hone in on the churrasco chicken sandwich, the soups, and the occasional savory crepe. The fruit drinks - which I never drink normally anywhere else - are really tasty, not sweet but fruity. They are the best at being what they are.
Will never get enough of this place. I live close by and go often, which is how Chez Jose is meant to be enjoyed - it's very neighbourhoody, kinda like going to a relative's for dinner, complete with Milo the puppy! I bring all my out of town visitors here, sometimes more than once. The food is always delicious, and the prices cannot be beat. Love the chorizo omelette, churassco sandwich, ham and cheese, their soups, the smoothies, and their coffee, and the fruit crepes...I know the menu by heart and I still struggle with what to get every time because it is just that good. The housemade hot sauce is so smoky and tasty we use about half a bottle every time we go in. Don't miss out.As expected for a busy small place with a small kitchen, service can be a bit slow and disorganized at times, especially if you go in a group. While this might frustrate some people, for me it kind of adds to the casual and intimate vibe - but I felt I should be honest for the sake of a review. They recognize this though and are very up front about it and always do their best to accommodate us. If you have the time (and patience, don't be a dick), I would highly highly recommend Chez Jose.
I highly recommend the vegetable (legumes) crepe with feta.  Ambience is fun. Servers are super friendly. Food is great!
Amazing! The owner cooks and his wife serves. The best breakfast I've had in Montreal!! The setting couldn't be more perfect. Very glad we stumbled upon this magnificent restaurant.
Everything from the ambience to the plates are super colorful and chockfull of goodness. I was years ago & have no idea why I haven't been back sooner. It's fab! I'll be back!
Nice vibe, good food, good service.
ChezJose is so delicious! I'm visiting Montreal for the first time. I was walking the area in hopes of finding the perfect breakfast, and found it. Such a great vibe and handmade everything, pastries, juices, crepes and so much more.
The owner of nearby D Liche (awesome cupcakes) enthusiastically recommended I check out Chez José's chorizo sandwich, and as the creator of some of the finest cup-based desserts I've ever tasted, that's a recommendation you listen to!Turns out that was a good decision. The chorizo sandwich is amazing. At first, you think it's just a pretty good sandwich. But as you eat, the flavor evolves and the interplay of ingredients starts channeling Remy from Ratatouille. The cheese is nestled between two slices of tasty chorizo. There are fresh pickles which add a pleasant crisp to every bite. The bread is squishy but just so. It's almost sandwich sorcery.For good measure, I also had a Mexican empanada, which was excellent. It was only $3 and damn near filled the plate. Coupled with their hot sauce - which is actually HOT - it made for a nice second offering.I'll be back for more chorizo and to try out their smoothies next time.
Best crepes I've ever had! We were visiting Montreal and stumbled across this place and the food was absolutely amazing and beautifully presented!
Although it has probably been a year since I've been to Chez Jose, it is still one of my favorite sandwich places in Montreal. On a hung over Sunday the Churrasco is a life-saver, filled with chicken, avocado and a horseradish spread on a portuguese bun. Another must-have is the seafood soup, which is spectacularly constructed, filled with all the goodies from the big blue. I seriously recommend this place. Cash only!
We first visited this place on a weekend trip to Montréal last October. It was a fantastic "last meal". We had our breakfast goodbye to the city at Chez José and thoroughly enjoyed it. The omelets are recommended as per this experience.This time around, I came with my girlfriend, and not schoolmates. We've been in Montréal for about two weeks on spring break and have visited Chez José twice (my previous stay in the Plateau informed me that it's the place to be for a vacation). We had sandwiches both times and coffee as well as the smoothies. Everything at this place is tasty and well-priced. It seems to be a staple for the locals. I can't recommend any other café in the area higher, and we've tried a few. A true Duluth neighborhood comfort spot.

This is a cute and hip spot for breakfast and coffee. This is one of the fav places in Montreal for their sandwiches. As you know traveling to Montreal or anywhere in Canada can be incredibly expensive. Luckily, for travelers, Chez Jose continues to open their doors for tasty meals at an cheap fare. The menu is only in French so make sure to let the waitress/waiter know if there's any confusion. I had their Mexican omelette sandwich with cheddar cheese and chicken. It was so yummy that I wish we were there right now. Hub had the chicken with avocado and cheese but it was not as flavorful as mine. We also had their coffees which was just ok. Go with their sandwiches, any combo, smoothies, and pastries. When in doubt, do what most French Canadians order- chocolate croissant and a coffee/cappuccino to go. The spot is located in the Portuguese and latin quarters of the neighborhood. A lot of homeless and crazies in the street so be careful of your belongings and bags!
I love this place. The owners were sooooo welcoming and friendly! They really took great care of us. It was our first time there. The food was very very yummy! Get the chicken sandwich and soup combo! It's great! Also, the croissants there are very very good. Will definitely come back when we are in Montreal next time.
A great place for a quick lunch or a good brunch. You can stop by as well for a coffee and a superb Palmier or an apple turnover. Home made flaky and buttery pastry !For lunch you can't go wrong with the soup of the day and if they have the fish soup, go for it !! A hearty soup with chunks of fish, mussels, rice and a great flavor !After take a nice omelet to share with their their grilled buns.And all is very reasonably priced.
I like the vibe here but honestly I wouldn't go back.Got a 9 dollar omelette with runny bits (ew) and an overdressed cheapo salad.  Made me feel a bit queasy for the rest of the day.I don't know. Cash only (annoying). Nice staff, good vibe.  You want to like it.
One of my favorites places in Montréal!Sundays brunch there, winter or summer: can bring me again to life!Thank you guys!!Always full, but wait is nothing there :)*Omelette and juice with xtrange names!!! blasty... something... are so goood!
Been here twice for crepes with friends. It's a casual cafe - the decor is kind of funky & colourful. It gets pretty busy on weekends. Pick what you want inside your crepe, one of three cheese, and then the fixings: Mexican, ham, chorizo, spinach, mushrooms, tuna, etc. The crepes come with a salad. Pretty yummy. The latte I ordered was average. The juices looked really good, maybe a tad pricey. They had a big cabinet full of pastries too. It's cash only.
went for brunch a few times on a weekday. it reminds me of great hippy-type places on the west cost. friendly staff, good fresh food.
Cool little cafe in the plateau. The chicken and avocado sandwich is delicious. Good espresso here. Only downside (or upside) is that this place is very small so don't be surprised if you can't get seating.
Meal: BreakfastRationale: Brunch was out of the question (I think because the place we intended to go was closed, plus it was Friday, so not many places were serving brunch to begin with), so we got breakfast at Chez José, which was a reasonable distance away from the first place.Food: They didn't have decaf, so I drank water instead. (And I haz'd a sad.) I wasn't too into their eggs, so I got a végépâté sandwich, having seen it on every lunch menu in Montreal, just to see what the deal was. Végépâté is a bit overwhelming if spread too thickly. When I ate meat I ate liverwurst sandwiches, so I'm not averse to the texture or the flavour, but I think this sandwich was a bit too heavy on the végépâté and light on the vegetables. That said: acceptable. I couldn't finish it, though, because I'd already filled up on my other breakfast item: the enormous, but very cheap, cheddar and vegetable empanada. I could have eaten on that beast exclusively. I'm a sucker for foods with fillings (doughnuts, dumplings, pierogies, etc.) and this empanada was bursting with flavourful filling. Nom.Service/atmosphere: Chez José is funky. Some may find it offputting, but I found the sticker of female genitalia on the microwave behind the counter endearing. Or, at the very least, amusing. Reminded me a bit of the East Village or Alphabet City in New York. Our waitress was nice enough. I asked for a water refill and she kindly showed me that we were seated next to a sink where we could get our own refills. Conclusion: A bit rough around the edges and idiosyncratic, but all slight faults were redeemed by the empanada. I can has more empanada?
I definitely like the Chez Jose chicken sandwich with avocado, hot sauce and a cup of coffee as an option in the area. This is a quick, tasty, cheap lunch on pretty Duluth that's not a chain, uses fresh ingredients, and has always in my experience offered friendly, if lowkey, service.
Smoothies are great, food is good. Very cheap sandwiches. Cozy aesthetic. I should like this place a lot more, and yet... I somehow always leave feeling slightly annoyed. Too many over-the-top hipsters and tourists, maybe? I can't put my finger on it. At the end of the day, however, I'm kind of indifferent about Chez José.
Great sized portioned omelette and decent smoothy. The menu is only en Francais - tourists be warned, but staff is helpful in both languages. As one reviewer chose Chez Jose over Swartz's - I'd choose Swartz if it had to be a choice. Great value all and all.
Love this breakfast spot! Super funky interior decor with real fruit smoothies (no blends of yogurt, milk, ice...or any other thing that has no rightful place in a FRUIT smoothie) I bought baked goods last time I was in Montreal from Chez José and brought them back to Halifax. That's how good the baking is!
This place has great ambiance - a corner restaurant in an interesting neighborhood.  I ordered the Pina Colada smoothie (very good) and an asparagus and mushroom omelet (disappointing).  They also have crepes, and those could be very good - need to try again sometime, and the pastries looked very good.The omelet was just so-so.  I really can't put my finger on it - the cheese (allegedly cheddar) did not have *any* taste, and neither did much of anything else.  I did not eat more than about 1/3rd of it.  It came with a field green salad, which was very good.Anyway, there is potential here, and I really liked the atmosphere, so I will try again.  But I never will have another omelet here.
The sandwiches, crepes and soups are delicious here but... the smoothies?! Dang. They should just call it "yum-juice" and leave it at that. This small and eclectic place has a hippy vibe that's easy to embrace. Great for a mid-day meal, their plates are loaded up with extra veg and cut-up fruits. The staff is so sweet you could mistake them for your relatives. * Still cash-only.
I had a decent 6$ sandwich. That's what I can say. I read other reviews and I really went there hoping for something decent, but I felt let down. You can't expect much for 6$ so it delivered there. But the service was terrible. 6 people in the place and the girl couldn't bother to show us more attention then the minimum requirement. The place is also dirty, quite dirty. I can handle cheap, but not a fan of dirty. Soupe soupe across the street is a better bet. A few bucks more but much better organized.
I don't know whether it's best to judge this particular book by its cover; the decor is eccentric and eclectic, but undeniably rad and the same might be said about the menu. I generally go for an early-morning breakfast or brunch and though it can be tough to get a seat in this teeny-tiny restaurant, it's well worth the wait. The omelette sandwiches are particularly good and incredibly inexpensive, especially considering the fact that you can load them up with absolutely any filling and incur no extra cost. Coming in a close second, though, is their amazing chicken sandwich, which has just the right amount of spicy mayo on a perfectly-cooked chicken breast. Accompanied by a smoothie (for a combined price of only $8), even the bill is satisfying.Also worth a mention is the incredibly charming staff, who are not only friendly but will always go the extra mile. When I went in for a family brunch and found there were no seats left, they set up a terasse just for us and successfully won our business for years to come.
For value for flavour and $ this is a winning choice for sandwichy fare.  I must admit that I have only had the warm Spicy capicoli sandwich with cheese and cucumber slathered in their hot sauce, but it is so frickin delicious.  I'm serious.  It's so good (and cheap), I have found it difficult to stray and try something different (which really isn't my typical MO).  My friends loved their Grilled Chicken Sandwiches with avocado, and the Vege Pate sandwich, so solid reviews all around.  The resto also makes delicious smoothies which are great support characters to the main dishes.  There is always a case full of danishes and desserts, but I haven't had a chance to indulge in these yet.  The ambiance is sort of hipster hippie (a la Santropol), but friendly and welcoming ... oh and the prices include taxes.  I like it when restos do that, just my thing I guess.  This place is totally worth a visit (or a few).
For my final Montreal lunch on this culinary adventure I had to decide between Shwartz's and Chez José.I made the right choice! Wickedly fresh juice, homemade empanadas that could stack up to the harshest Buenos Aires foodie and a proper sandwich full of veg and poulet.Awesome finalé!Merci Montreal.
Chez Jose173 avenue Duluth EstMontréal, QC H2W 1H4(514) 845-06934 starsWhen I was a student living in Montreal, Chez Jose was my favourite little cafe and pastry shop. It was right around the corner from my boyfriends', so on weekends we'd head on over with bedhead to wake up with the most heavenly 'cafe au lait' and 'pain au chocolat' you've ever tasted. The delicate pastry was always perfectly light, crispy and buttery and the inside chocolate melted in your mouth like a divine communion. We'd hang out at the tables in the funky little shop, and lazily watch the people on Avenue Duluth or study while we ate. It's cash only, which was no problem; as students, we didn't have credit anyway! They have the most incredible guacamole chicken sandwiches here, made with fresh chicken breast and roasted vegetables. These were the only things I ordered on the menu. They became rituals, study treats, weekend getaways and tantalizing Montreal memories.
Chez Jose I adore you, your food, your staff, your coffee and your jam.The food is simple, fresh and done well. I'm a big fan of the omelets and the fresh pastries. Chez Jose has a great vibe- I don't know if it's the staff, the music or the patrons but it's really laid-back and happy. It's the best in the summer when the windows and doors are open and gentle breezes flow throughout the place. I love this place!!
This place has everything I want and more. The staff are lovely, the food is great and really well priced and they also have smoothies and amazing baked goods as well. I got a smoothie and a veggie pate sandwich and it was so delish and only $8. The food came fast and I got to take a look at all the cool decor while I waited for my food. The place is small but the murals outside make it hard to miss. I would go here for breakfast, lunch, dinner or a snack.
The coziest spot for a summer afternoon meal. I almost felt transported to Williamsburg for a moment but I realize how much this place reflected what you look for in Montreal. I expected a simple lunch in the first place but I'd never thought I would get such a great meal.The sandwiches are just amazing and unlike other sandwich shops, Chez Jose has a very specialized menu with a few but very unique choices, I especially recommend the Chourico Fromage which will fill you up and only cost you $6. More, you can combine it with a fresh fruit juice for $9. However, Spanish food-savvy critiques will definitely question the Gazpacho's recipe. But hey - that's for pros only. You feel home chez Jose and that's the best about it.
It's hipsterish and found in Montreal's Middle-Earth located somewhere between Mile-End and the Plateau. Oh, and they make really good sandwiches and fruit smoothies. Yum!
Chez Jose an airy little cafe with a whole lot of character. While one wall is painted in zebra print, another is adorned with sunflowers, and the next with colourful fish. On hot summer days, other than the few tiny tables that line the perimeter, seating is limited to the inside on your choice of an eclectic collection of mismatched wooden chairs. Don't worry if you had hoped to do some people watching or sunlight absorption, it's all still possible with the windows opened wide.A white board lists the combinations of fruit smoothies made with 100% orange juice available. A glass display case shows off the drool-inducing assortment of pastries. Sandwiches and salads du jour keeps things fresh and light.You'll want to make sure you've got cash with you though since they don't take cards. If you find yourself cashless and hungry (and lazy) though, the dep next door charges $2.25 for "cash back", purchase optional.
Super crepes and delicious if expensive juice.
I came here a few weeks ago, and the one thing that was almost better than the food, was the price!  People, I must say that to get a full on satisfying meal (drink aaaandd dessert) for $13 is ridiculous (skip dessert and it's under $10)!  I had the Chicken and Avocado Sandwich, the smoothie with mango in it, and the chocolate croissant brioche (sent me over the edge) and traded bites with my friend who had the triple berry pie. Staff was personable and friendly -served en français et in english, and though the establishment isn't big, super quaint! I've already raved about the place to 10 other people.
Yes, this place is super cool.  Super tiny; but super cool.  Try not to go with a large group or the seating will be awkward.  Their menu is really awesome -- more a lunch-type menu with sandwiches and soups.  If I remember correctly, they had a seafood soup that was only served on Fridays and it was delicious!You can get a really decent meal with smoothie and all for around $10.  Their servers are cool and the decor is so very Montreal.
This place is plain awesome. The menu is not big which usually indicates a good eatery. All that is on the menu is worth tasting. Signature dishes include omelettes, crepes and smoothies. The pastries are good, too. The only thing that saddens me is that I can't have all I enjoy there at once, it would be too much for one meal.The owner and staff are outdoorsy and very friendly. One can notice funny notes here and there that change over time to reflect recent internet memes.
Dear Chez Jose staff: I have an excellent proposition for you. You move to Honolulu and bake here. In return, I give you excellent weather!!! Umm that's about all I can give in return though.Can't say I didn't try...It's been a while since I last visited this place but the pain au chocolat was indeed amazing!!! And mmmm their crepes too!!! The service had always been great and I wasn't kidding when I said I wish I could take this place with me (or at least the bakers haha.)Montrealers are soooooo lucky to have awesome boulangeries/patisseries. I would kill for a good croissant, some brioche or pain au chocolat right now.
Reviews for this little café were so good, we decided to give it a try. Our sandwiches were quite bland and the service uneven. The fruit juice was really good and we did not have time for dessert or coffee which seem to be the main reason why people go there. Please note that they do not take Interac or credit cards but the dépanneur next door will give you some cash back if you ask at the counter.
Amazing brunch spot and bakery with absolutely awesome smoothies and delcious lattes. Vegetarian friendly crepes are excellent. The only thing on the menu that disappoints those in the know are the empanadas but since everything else is so great that shouldn't detract from your experience at all. As an added bonus, the specials are always great deals and the coffee options are always delicious!  The only reason Chez Jose didn't get five stars is because several times when I've been there with just one dining mate we've been stuck at a long table with loud groups of other patrons on either side crowding our space. It hasn't stopped me from going back again and again but it can slightly detract from the overall experience.
Yuummm Really nice place. Me and my husband walked to this place on a Wed afternoon. I the Omlette with him trying the beef soup and with Pina Colada smoothie each. They were delicious and cheap for the price. The place was cozy, giving a lot of one-on-one interaction time. the Chocolate tarte was yummy too. We took it to-go and ate it along the way out. The food was good, with great service and nice and friendly environment. Definitely will come back!
Awesome sandwichs / crepes / juice for cheap.  They have a sandwich and juice special for $8 CAD.  They have both savory and sweet crepes with 10+ ingredients for each.  They use frozen strawberries in their smoothies, but it's actually quite nice as it's cold and refreshing.
I was introduced to Chez Jose by one of my coworkers who is pretty much obsessed with the place. It's a really funky little cafe and there are almost always lineups of people getting takeout sandwiches at lunch. Needless to say I grab lunch here (with said coworker) at least once a week and I have trouble straying from the churrasco. It's just so tasty and satisfying, and for a mere $5 it's a great value. They have a nice selection of pastries, too. A lot of my coworkers are partial to the berry pie, but so far I've only tried the pain au chocolat, which was delicious.
A good little breakfast place that serves up excellent omelettes. A personal plus for me is that you get a real coffee with breakfast (read allongé, espresso, latte, etc.)!Get there early otherwise prepare to wait.
Friendliest and cheekiest counter-staff I've met so far in Montreal. José himself is at the cash register every morning. Warm pastries right out of the oven - mmm.Simple all day menu filled with affordable good food. Satisfying sandwiches, generous omelets and cold fruit smoothies. Really good and really affordable. *Cash only.
It was pretty early in the morning.  We didn't want to go to some tourisy and diner breakfast spot.  Of course, Chez Jose tucked away in Rue Duluth whispered us in with its tiny interior and young locals alike.  Like any montreal spot you've got choices of pastry lined up behind the glass case, but that's not why I came here.  I saw someone eating mussels, in the morning!?  Why not!  Turns out it was a seafood soup, sounds even better.  I got that $10 along with a pint of pina colada smoothie $4.  The soup is filled with fish pieces, calamari, mussels and tiny scallops, with tons of romesco orange sauce and soaked rice, yum!  It was super good, I wanna make it.  My boyfriend got the olive noires et formage de cheddar omelet, $8.  It was pretty good too, I kind of wish I got that as well.  This is probably my favourite spot for breakfast in ville.  Bien sur!  Je retourne l'an porchaine.
Fun little place on a funky street away from downtown Montreal.  The crepes are good, but what is underrated are the unique juice blends.  Certainly something to worth a bit of a walk, even if the walk isn't very scenic. They also seem to put the same amount of chocolate on every crepe, even the dedicated chocolate crepe.  Just keep that in mind when ordering.  Enjoy.
I love this place!  I only stopped in for a second and the guy working there was very kind about my sad grip on the French language. Ordered a chausson aux pomme... It was SO good, packed with apple... I will make a bee-line there when I head to Montreal next.
Lovelovelove this place!the empanadas are delicious! The sandwiches as well!Great cafe au lait. A good neighborhood coffee shop all around. I'm a fan.
I rarely eat out for breakfast. I usually only go out for breakfast on trips. Everyone recommended this place, so I wanted to give it a try. Very mellow atmosphere, which is the right mood to start off any morning. I had an omelet, which was delicious. Then topped it off with some orange juice and some pain au chocolat. The pain au chocolat was Amazing. Capital A.
So cute, The food is good, and atmosphere is mellow. Perfect for lunch. Love the fish soup!
Two of my friends and I were there randomly last Sunday morning and we all enjoyed the experience! The price-quality ratio is excellent and the person who waited on us was very professional.
The best omellettes in town by far. Very creative, portuguese influence. Great ambiance, good food and very modest prices make this place an ultimate choice for a Sunday brunch routine
go here and eat sandwiches(churrasso my favorite). the soup( tomate avec fromage bleu!.) the smooothies, oh god the pastries, and the empanadas. have a melt down on your walk home after because the food was soo good, the price was reesonable and the service was casual and gorgeous. angrily thrust your pointing fingers at passing pedestrians and cry to the heavens " why in hell do i you forsake their tongues? let them eat"
Funky small cafe on the corner, not a lot seating. Had a chicken sandwich and smoothie...the sandwich was tasty and would recommend going back.
This is my favorite cafe in Montreal. It's inexpensive and the portions are a good size. Omelettes and empanadas are DELICIOUS. The service is laid back and friendly. Also, they do not mock my awful attempts at French.
We enjoyed a great lunch here a couple of weeks ago.  Cute location.  I had the vegetarian empanada special with a great side salad.  My husband enjoyed an omelet sandwich and my daughter had a yummy ham and cheese.  Service was friendly.  We forgot my daughter's water bottle and went back a few hours later and they had saved it for us.  A great spot in a great neighborhood!
Chez Jose is undeniably cool. We stopped in for lunch after a bike ride around old Montreal and it was so satisfying and fun. We all had fresh fruit smoothies and sandwiches. The food and drinks were delicious and really reasonably priced. Thanks for a fun afternoon, Johnny, you're the shit!
My boyfriend and I visited Montreal this week! We randomly stumbled upon this cafe! We ordered the TMC croissant with bacon and another with ham. AMAZING croissant I have ever tasted!!! The croissant was fresh and so were the ingredients. The TMC had hard boiled eggs, lettuce, tomatoes, cheddar cheese and house mayonnaise. We actually ended up going back the next day! I ordered the TMC with bacon again. The second time, my boyfriend ordered the bagel breakfast. It was a sesame seed poppy bagel with bacon, Swiss cheese, lettuce and tomatoes. The bagel was also amazing. The atmosphere was very intimate and clean. The service was exceptional. The presentation was very on point for a breakfast Cafe. I would highly recommend this place!
We dropped by this cafe after a long bus ride. The cafes environment was pleasant and the server was patient even when we had 8 people coming in at once. The food was not too bad but fresh at least. I definitely enjoyed it. I recommend getting the bagel BLT with egg or whatever added on.
Came here for a quick breakfast and coffee during a visit to Montreal not too long ago.It was a bit later on a weekday morning, probably around 11:00am or so. The Mon Cafe was pretty empty, and I was able to place my order within moments.I had the famous Montreal bagel, with a coffee as well. Pretty standard fare, although it would be nice to see the choices dressed up a bit. I was underwhelmed by the presentation and the value for what I was paying for. A small plate with just the bagel and a tiny cup of coffee. I'd go back, but I'm in no rush. The food was good. Service was fine. But I didn't see much value.
It was a decent place to have breakfast in the neighbourhood. However, other than their warm chocolate croissant, everything was just okay. We got latte, croissant sandwiches (with bacon or ham, sliced boiled eggs, lettuce and tomato) and chocolate croissant for dessert. Coffee was bitter as well. The owner was really nice and friendly.
Cripes sake, here we go again with the "big 5" review.But lookit, this place is a GEM.  Hah, that even sounds fresh like I am being sarcastic~promise I'm not.  It really is a great escape for breakfast and brunch where you truly feel you are separated from the American tourist traps.  We came here on some pretty dreary, rainy, cold start of summer days-making the 2 mile trek from the hotel on foot to take in the sights along the way (people watching - such a pleasure in Montreal)So, go here a lot and order everything on the menu. You will be glad you did!
Delicious (but TINY!)The reviews are great - I love my yelp community!This was a hidden gem of a spot - all the reviews lay true.Watch for the entrance to this spot - if you walk by you'll be circling trying to figure it out. The entrance is literally across the street from an alley way! Don't forget that part.We waited in line for a solid 20 minutes before ordering.There are only 10 tables in the joint, and you can only sit after getting a table number, you only get a table number after you order, and you only order after you've waited. Bizarre but strangely effective.I ordered the eggs Benedict with bacon on a croissant! Genius (I thought so) as it's not on the menu but the owner was happy to oblige. (Yes I paid extra, no I didn't mind) it was worth it. My fiancé also got the Eggs Benny with bacon on a classic English muffin and said it was good - but not as good as mine.We followed our breakfast with hot tea and a cappuccino and a chocolate croissant to go! (Order it with your breakfast or there will be none left!)Don't go if you're starving or in a hurry - we went there for 11AM and I could tell the people waiting in line behind us were not pleased with the wait - brunching in Montreal is not the same as Toronto or Europe.Lovely breakfast and I will definitely be back - the only thing missing was music - it was crazy silent and the space is so beautiful - it was strange not to have soft music playing in such a lovely space.
I would recommend the breakfast bagel! A cute little cafe with real coffee and freshly prepared sandwiches. Definitely would not have found this place if it wasn't for Yelp 'cos it is not a tourist hot spot at all! Thanks guys!Go through the mall/complex and the entrance to the cafe is from the inside of the bigger building it's housed in.
Decor 3/5 food 3/5 staff&service 5/5Food was delicious and prices were great. The staff is super friendly and I would recommend anyone to go but word of advice - it's a pretty small place so get there before 10am to get a spot on the weekend. I thought 12.95$ was rather expensive however for eggs benedict considering it was only two eggs benedict and a small cup of fruit, for that price at any other breakfast spot you would get toast and some roasted potatoes on top of that. But with a small latte I felt satisfied.
Had the caramel latte...best thing I've ever had. It was a frigid 5 degrees Fahrenheit and I needed to warm up. The place is cute and cozy and was a great vibe!
Located in old Montreal this quaint little cafe is an excellent option for a quick breakfast pit stop. You'll nearly certainly miss the entrance because you'll think it's the entrance to the shop right next door. But don't be fooled (like us and the couple of other people that made the U-turn after they walked right past it), they share that entrance.The breakfast menu is limited on the weekend- just a few basics. They offer pastries, fresh fruit, eggs Benedict, a croissant TMC (which is essentially hard boiled egg, lettuce, tomato, mayo, cheese, & bacon) and the classic egg and cheese on choice of bread. My egg and cheese was good, the croissant was perfectly flaky. My friend's TMC was delicious and her husband's eggs benedict were the subject of my admiration and envy. I would definitely go for the Benedict next time... They looked perfectly poached!My friend ordered the "medium latte" which really looked like it could feed a family of 4! It was impressive and beautifully decorated with latte art. Despite their simple menu, they didn't skimp at all on quality or presentation. The cozy and inviting feel of the cafe earns them bonus points as well.
Visited with a fairly large group of people for breakfast. The service was great, and the food was delicious! The chocolate croissant was incredible, and the BLT bagel really hit the spot.
Nice small place, but with very good breakfast and they serve a very good coffee! I had the tmc croissant and I liked it very much
I don't hate this place, i just don't need to come back.  This is a cafe with cafe fare with tourist trap prices.  Saturday brunch with a TMC croissant sandwhich that everyone has complimented.  It's a croissant sandwich any decent cafe in Mtl quality.  So better than the chain coffee shops but by MTL standards we've got better.  The cincher is the Panatone breakfast sandwhich which should say sample size $13 for half a tiny sandwhich size.  Hmm... No.  It was soggy, and tiny. Coffee and tea is seperate.  So our total bill for two peopleata cafewas $28 and change. Totally not worth it. Thanks but only if you want a coffee or tea.*The photo I took of the Panatoast has crumbs on the plate cause I shared my croissant with him .
This place is really cute and my breakfast was amazing! I made up my own sandwich -an egg and cheese with avocado on a croissant and they made it perfectly. The almond milk latte was delicious too!
Very tasty food! Ordered the caramel latte and it was delicious as well! Would return here if ever back in Montreal!
Quaint little place that offers a small selection of delicious brunch and lunch options. We jointly had the bacon Benedict, the ham Benedict,  a dirty Chai latte,  a chocolate crossiant and an orange juice... Everything is reasonably priced and the food is quite delicious and cooked from scratch.. The Benedict was cooked perfectly with the egg really runny.  The hollandaise sauce was one of the better ones I've had too. It comes with a side of fruit which is really really fresh. The chocolate crossiant was really good,  but as flaky as expecting but the chocolate flavor with nuts added a nice flavor. Once again,  which is becoming a Canadian norm,  the service was really really nice and enjoyable.
A good place for brunch that offers good selection and delicious food. We ordered the eggs benedict with bacon and the eggs benedict with ham and a latte. The eggs benedicts were delicious and the fruit cup that comes with it was good. The prices are very reasonably priced. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The only thing is when we arrived at noon, they had limited selection of food left. Also, I liked the food and the crossiant I had a lot, but I've had better. But for the price and food, I would come again for a quick brunch.
This is truly a hidden gem. The yelp reviews were pretty convincing so we decided to give this spot a try. It's a definite winner! It was recommended that we try the "Croissant TMC" which is essentially an open face breakfast BLT. It includes sliced hard boiled eggs, Swiss cheese, choice of bacon or ham and lettuce with tomato of course. We were blown away! The croissant was baked to perfection with a flaky buttery crust. We savored every bite. To top things off, we were offered complimentary coffee that was also delish (but don't expect that when u get here)In summary, this place comes highly recommended. It's a must try if you're in Vieux Montréal.
Cool place. Serving authentic French breakfast. The coffee was amazing. And the croissant sandwich is the best of its kind I've had. Yum! Plus not to forget the almond croissant that puts your brain to indulge in the subtleties of the taste. The decor brought memories from Europe and the people in it are the most helpful as ever. Definitely up for a treat in downtown Montreal.
I really wasn't a fan of this place. We had a macchiato which was extremely bitter,  I did not enjoy it. Had french toast for breakfast,  I didn't like the hidden raisins inside it. Just not my favorite.
Just had a great little breakfast here.I'm not much of a coffee expert but me and the Mrs. both enjoyed our cappuccino and mochas.Breakfast was a croissant TMC, fruit salad, spiced hash browns, French toast Sandwich was great, yes very simple but the buttery croissant doesn't need muchWell worth the 3 minute walk from my Westin hotel where they are charging $22 for a tiny generic plate with no cappuccino
Found this little gem via yelp and our concierge also recommended it. Very nice atmosphere, little cafe, similar to something in Europe but without the view. We did see a horse and carriage roll by but maybe because it's a Sunday there wasn't much else going on to see.I had the eggs Benedict (one of their specials of the day) which was cooked perfectly. The hollandaise which I asked for on the side was very good as well. It was served with diced fresh fruit, pineapple, melon, strawberries etc. The espresso was perfect and I was even asked if I wanted a long or short pull. We make them at home with long pulls and it was great to be asked that here.My wife had a croissant with fruit and espresso and enjoyed it thoroughly as well.The staff was very friendly too.
Had this place for lunch as a take out. Ordered the Italian sandwich and potato salad. Sandwich tasted good and was grilled perfectly. It was a square bun with sliced Italian sausage and vegetables on it. Portions were a bit small and not ideal for sharing. Was good. I would recommend for someone looking for a light option for lunch that is quick and tasty.
This was a decent place and a nice start to the day in Old Montreal.  I had a latte and a breakfast bagel with bacon, Swiss cheese and egg.  It came to around $10 total including tax.  The latte itself was not bad.  It wasn't super amazing, but it had the right foam to coffee ratio.  As for the breakfast bagel, it was on a freshly toasted sesame bagel, had lettuce, tomatoes, Swiss cheese and an egg.  I liked the fact that you could choose between Swiss and cheddar cheese. While the ingredients were super fresh and the eggs were actual eggs (unlike a lot of places now who are just liquid egg for their sandwiches), the sandwich itself was a bit bland.  If they had a hint of ketcup, mayo, some salt or something, it could have put this sandwich over the top, but unfortunately, they didn't.  As for the ambiance itself, it's a small cafe with about 10 seats or so but what I really liked doing was that I could sit at the window and people watch.  Verdict: Good way to start off your morning and just people watch.  Nothing super special, but it'll do the trick.
Best mocha I've ever had.  Frothy, silky, mmmmm.  Wonderful service and free wifi - lovely.
I visited Montreal for a few days and this cafe was a brief walk from the hotel. The bagels, the croissants, the coffee, the chai latte are absolutely delicious! This a cute little cafe and perfect for breakfast.
Best breakfast I've ever had...literally! This is the go to place for breakfast/brunch when staying around downtown Montreal. The menu is short but the food is delicious! Must try the Eggs Benedict!
We all get the TMC for a quick breakfast as well as iced cappuccino.  Just a quaint and lovely Cafe.
Grabbed a quick breakfast here and would definitely do so again. Very quick, friendly service - willing to put up with my miserable French. The atmosphere is bright and lively. I got the breakfast special - hard boiled eggs, ham, and tomato on a croissant - very good
My wife & i ate breakfast here and we really loved it. We had the absolute best croissants we have ever had. Their chai tea was also, without question, the absolute best I have ever had.The space itself is very charming & the staff extremely friendly. You really owe it to yourself to stop in and eat here.
We came into The Mon Cafe with the simple request of a heart shaped coffee, it was done magnificently and with great service, coffee tasted delicious and with good company, I can only recommend this little coffee shop, only downside was the price, slightly steep but all around delicious.
Delicious! I kept hearing to try a bagel while in Montreal and I'm glad I did! Wow, it was delightful. I had a regular bagel with cream cheese, it was plain cream cheese but there was something magical about it. Also, the chai tea was good. My fiancé had the breakfast bagel which was also tasty.
Simple, tasty breakfast spot.  Nice people. Really enjoyed my breakfast sandwich. Perfect quick and tasty breakfast spot before my tour.
Excellent breakfast.  Friendly staff.  Quick service.The TMC croissant was amazing!
Tiny little cafe near the Notre Dame. I'm a big fan of the The Mon Cafe croissant or as they call it "TMC Croissant" . Slices of boiled egg with your choice of meat (ham, bacon) with lettuce and tomatoes and homemade dressing served on a croissant. Its available between 7 am to 11 am. They do some great lunch sandwiches too. Especially the tuna, Italian and the porchetta sandwich. But I'd visit this place especially for the TMC Croissant.Food : GoodService :FastAmbiance : CasualWorth the price : Yes
I went to Thé Mon Café twice, they have very decent coffee and tea and the staff was friendly. The place itself is only alright. I wouldn't mind coming back but it just would not be my first choice.
This is a nice option for those who want to skip the very expensive hotel breakfast at places like the Intercontinental or Westin. I went here for breakfast every morning during a week-long work trip, as it was cheap and good and had free wifi. But be prepared: breakfast is really only one option--a bacon or ham egg sandwich on a bagel or croissant. This is a tiny coffee place and they don't really have a kitchen. The coffee is good and the service is very good. I did not go here for lunch so cannot comment on their lunch sandwich or soup.
If I could eat words, I'd never go anywhere else. Arrived on a Saturday morning in January and was promised "the best food you've ever tasted" and that they could make "anything you can imagine". The charm of our server was much appreciated, even when I didn't get the dish I thought I had ordered. The food was good; the place is tucked away: cozy, but without any view or hint of the city outside. I didn't really like  the coffee, but it did the trick.
As everyone else already said, everything was top notch and very tasty.  Cappuccino was excellent.
Great small little cafe. Up for a weekend trip and staying in a hotel near the Basillica of Notre Dame and needed a quick breakfast. Stopped in and had an excellent breakfast sandwich. Coffee and teas were excellent too. Conveniently located, very friendly and helpful staff for us American speaking touristsWould recommend
Here for breakfast with my brother.  I had the english muffin with bacon egg and cheddar.  I believe he had the same.  I had a medium latte and he enjoyed a cappuccino. Overall, excellent.  The nice touches include the staff who are especially helpful and attentive.  We liked free wifi.  The atmosphere is casual, really casual.  Seating is a bit limited.  Bottom line:  Will definitely be back for an easy breezy breakfast!
Simple food. Nice service. I had croissant sandwich, orange juice and an americano with ice for breakfast. I went there twice. They don't have ice coffee. In the same region I prefer Differance Cafe.
Great place with good food and welcome staff. We had the TMC croissant and a fruit cookie with coffees. All were really good. The house mayonnaise is very tasty. Highly recommended.
Super cute place with very friendly service! If you need a quick breakfast sandwich, this cafe won't disappoint.
Popped in for brekkie after looking these guys up on Yelp. Signature breakfast highly recommended - croissant, Swiss cheese, tomato, boiled egg and lettuce - yum!!!
We had one of the best latte's -out of hundreds of places high end or not- was made here today.  Staff was friendly and cordial, and the food was outstanding.We're talking about going back tomorrow in leiu of anywhere else in Montreal.  It's a little bit away from the main tourist path, but worth the extra block walk.
Stayed at the the Westin and we were looking for a place close by... Read the reviews and said lets do the walk... First... Excellent service... Very accommodating to us US trackers... Food was awesome... We got the English muffin with egg and bacon and an excellent chocolate croissant ...we also asked for a glass with lemon for our soda.... Not a problem and was more than helpful to do.... Well deserved the review!!!!
This unassuming spot was fantastic! We rec the TMC and eggs Benedict. Great coffee. Nice people. Hope to return.
It's a cute place and the staff are friendly. But I probably will not go back unless everything else is closed in the neighbourhood. Nothing too too special. Coffee and food were OKAY. Again, if you are in the neighbourhood, it's not a bad place to grab a quick bite. But I won't travel a long distance to try the food here.
Exceptionally friendly and efficient serviceClean and comfortable environment Delicious croissant TMC sandwich with ham Would definitely go there again!
My wife and I stopped by for breakfast and it was delicious! Both of us had egg Benedict - it came with bacon and fresh fruits.
We had a delicious Breakfast here. We originally wanted to try their egg Benny , however, they do not serve it on the weekdays. We had the croissant tmc instead. It turned out great! We really enjoyed it. Love their latte and Moka too
The food is good if you get what you order.  The place is a confusing mess when it's at all busy.  You order food at the register but don't pay until you are done for some reason.  I lost count of the people who were baffled by this.  Then you have people milling around trying to pay or order.  No one who has already eaten wants to wait in the line to order. Then they can't seem to get orders right.  There is a difference between bacon and ham.  They even have both options on the menu.  Yet our order and a few customers around me had bacon arrive instead of the ham they ordered.  The place is just not worth the aggravation in the morning.
Good decent breakfast but it gets very busy here only 2 person working in this place. If you are looking for decent sit down place to chill with friends this is not the place.
Very friendly place--made us tourists feel very welcome. Tasty food and excellent selection of fine teas.
Cafe is adorable! I wish they had a menu we could look at though rather than a small chalkboard the server reads out loud. I ordered eggs Benedict with bacon. The eggs were delicious but the side fruit salad was not fresh and smeared with sweet syrup. I also ordered a chai latte to go and it tasted like cinnamon foamed milk.
Stop by when I was in the area..... I mean I'm a breakfast dinner fan so whenever I travel I have to try local breakfast spot. The taste was good but I think it is a bit pricy for what I got. It is worth to check out the spot but it won't be me regular for breakfast spot. I Don't Mind Stop By for some coffee tho :)
Great for a light breakfast. Best latte in Montreal so far for me and best cup of tea for my wife. Hot and loose tea in a filter.
I was in Montreal for work for few days.  During this trip I was so sick that I couldn't eat.  The only thing I could eat was their grilled cheese sandwich and wash it down with the best late.  They make even a simple sandwich look pretty on a plate.I am looking forward to coming back with my husband on my next trip.  Few of my local friends make The Mon Café one of their regular spots and I totally get why.  The food is incredible and the service is amazing!  Even if you don't speak French, they speak English and are super nice!
We popped in for a quick breakfast on the way to shop and sightsee.  This personable little place will make you made to order Eggs Benedict or scrambled eggs but apparently, they are famous for croissants.  If you are gluten free (as I am) peep in the glass front case for some cut fruit and yogurt.  My cappuccino was perfect!  Seriously, perfect. The café is not visible from the street and is up the stairs in a corner of a large building that also houses a hotel. If you are walking in Old Montreal, it's worth a stop.
This was our first stop during our two day trip to Montreal.  I wanted their much loved TMC croissant but we got there at 11:30, half an hour after the cut-off time. Bummer. My wife asked them what was in the croissant and the guy behind the counter said they put stuff inside the croissant and then magic happens. Dammit I wanted to see a magic show.So we were wondering if we should eat there or go somewhere else but judging from the growing lunch crowd and the smell coming out of the back, we decided to trust our senses and stay. Le wife was unsure about eating pre-made sandwiches but she was soon singing a different song.Her roast beef sandwich came with tender, flavorful, medium rare roast beef. My porchetta sandwich was no different. The pochetta didn't have annoying, hard chunky pieces of pork like I've sometimes come across. Instead, it was almost like a cubano and even had sliced pickles. There was arugula and swiss cheese on both sandwiches, all held together by excellent bread that, if not made in house, would be shocking, They both tasted like they were made fresh. I suppose that was the advantage of going at 11:30.They also had free wifi. After we finished, we were standing right outside, yelping and planning our next move.  The friendly owner/chef saw us, came over and started talking to us. He gave us some good pointers on where else to go besides the regular places that most people go to. Great guy.Next time I'm in Montreal, I'll be sure to come here before 11.
We loved this place! Our concierge recommended this place and it was perfect! We both had delicious espresso, I had a flaky croissant with fresh fruit and my husband had the bacon eggs benedict. The staff was super friendly food was great. Reminded us of being back in Paris.
While staying at the W Hotel during a recent Montréal trip I needed to find a spot to hole up and knock out a few hours of work, preferably somewhere not so busy on a weekday, serving food all day with some potent caffeinated beverages. Alors là! The perfect breakfast/lunch work space. Friendly café staff, delicious and healthy breakfast and lunch options. I went with a panino and salad combo, delish! Plenty of cappuccinos kept me typing away for hours. The free WiFi is also incredibly consistent and reliable. Pull up a chair by the window and you can gaze out at street traffic in old MTL. Thank you Thé Mon and Yelp for leading me here!
I had the BEST (ever!!) Eggs Benedict here today! Wow, so  fresh and the hollandaise sauce was absolute perfection! It is a really tiny place (with one person working the front and another cooking in the back but for the lovely meal I had, I would totally go back and wait if I needed to!!
This is a nice little cafe with great service. Has a homie feel. Deff recommend if you are in the city... The people won't let you down...
What a great little gem!  Don't be fooled when you walk in--it's very small and European.  The barista was extremely nice and informative about their specialty breakfast sandwich (TMC).  The sandwich was delicious and the coffee was great.  Quick service.  Would definitely return on my next trip to Montreal.
Yay! We're from NYC & we couldn't find any great coffee places & we found it! Trust me,it is worth the travel over to Old Port Montreal. I had a honey chai latte & my friend had a honey soy latte. Perfection. If you're hungry, get the Panatoast. French toast,bacon,& cheddar cheese,topped with maple syrup! Devine! Go,now!
Loved this place! The food and service was amazing. Loved the gentleman who served us he was so kind and polite and genuine. We had the eggs Benedict with bacon, a French toast and cappuccino and chai latte. The eggs Benedict with bacon was delicious. The French toast wasn't anything special just looked good. Maybe because I'm not a fan of raisin and it had raisin bits in the French toast. It was also too fluffy to my liking. The chai latte was also amazing they use fresh chai. I would definitely return next time I visit Montreal.
If I could give a 0 I would. The person in charge was extremely rude bordering on scary. He was so nasty to the couple waiting ahead of us that when he barked at me for trying to read the blackboard menu we decided to just leave. Best decision ever!! Don't bother with this place. Instead go to L'oeufrier! Omggg so yummy, waitress servi e at the same prices and excellent friendly service. Why go somewhere where you are treated as if the staff are doing you a favor by letting you eat there?!
We had a quick and delicious breakfast here on a recent trip to Montreal. We both got the bacon egg and cheese with lettuce and tomato, which was a nice, filling but healthy start to the day. It came with fruit salad that tasted very fresh. The latte I got was also quite good.Unfortunately we were only able to come here once during our trip, but it was a nice starting off point for a day in Old Montreal.
Very polite staff, delicious breakfast and adorable atmosphere. We ordered a breakfast sandwich and eggs Benedict. The eggs Benedict were exceptional and the sandwich equally as tasty.
This Cafe was a brilliant find on the outskirts of old Montreal!  As soon as we walked in we were greeted by the nicest man explaining the menu to us.  My wife and I had the croissant sandwich and French toast with fresh fruit, both were exceptional!We also enjoyed large bowls of cafe au lait, again very tasty!  I will definitely return to this quaint little cafe the next time I visit Montreal.
A quaint little spot around the corner from the Westin. The proprietor was amazingly nice and the cafe latte perfect. My husband had the latte as well but with an extra shot which he said was spot on. The owner gave my husband some tips on making the perfect latte. We had breakfast sandwiches on croissants which were delish.
We visited on Sunday morning. The welcome is pleasant and low key.The menu was explained to us well - it is quite limiting so we shared some fruit and had a Muffin and a croissant. Along with coffees...The fruit was tasty, the Muffin a little too salty and the croissant with its ham, egg, cheese and tomato fillings average. The macchiato was good and the cappuccino too big...the coffee flavour so diluted.Ok - yes but a little underwhelming.
A little small but cozy. We had an americano and espresso which were top notch. We didn't eat but the food coming out looked good. Bathrooms are shared with the building, and you need to get the key. Would go back and would recommend to anyone.
The Eggs Benedict was delicious!I did not see a lot of cute breakfast places in downtown montreal.   This place has character and great food.  We had this chocolate croissant that was fantastic.  The place is a little bit if a wall from where we stayed downtown, but definitely worth it.
Review from January 2013:We found this place on Yelp and were not disappointed. The cafe is cozy and quaint! I love the decor - simple and sweet. The menu isn't very extensive, but you can rest assured that whatever you order will be delicious. We had a party of 8 and the staff was very helpful in offering suggestions and describing the dishes. The fruit salad is fresh tasting and delicious, but the almond croissants stole the show. LOADED with almonds on the inside and out and held together with soft flaky pastry. Heaven in a crescent.Best croissant of my life. I've been trying to find a rival ever since ... no luck.
What a tasty little cafe. The wife and I grabbed a quick breakfast here. It is very small inside, but the croissant sandwiches were delicious, and the fruit was very fresh...which was a pleasant surprise given that it was November. The coffee was perfectly crafted and was the perfect start to a morning exploring Montreal. Absolutely give this place a try if you find yourself in Old Montreal.
Just eat here. Never in my life have I met a croissant like the one I eat here. The hit cocoa and brownies are fresh and delightful, especially on a Rainey morning. This cafe made me very happy.
After consulting the all-knowing and all-powerful Yelp app, we decided to crush our hangover here. Mission accomplished!First, the cafe au lait... So rich, so bold.  It was perfection in a huge cup. The winning moment, however, was when I took the first bite of my French Toast. It had bacon and white cheddar cheese. YES, white cheddar cheese!  I followed my server's advice and dumped all of the real maple syrup on top. After that first bite I was screaming like a giddy schoolgirl on the inside, but somehow remained stoic on the outside. I'm a pro like that.  This place is small and unassuming, but the food is the real deal and that's why I would not hesitate to return.
Double cappuccino - good! TMC croissant with bacon. Amazing! Flakey and delicious. The fruit saled with the mint is awesome. Amazing how the mint adds to the salad. Not overpowering.Ham eggs Bennie. Classic eggs Bennie. Perfect in its own right. Nothing extravagant, but what you'd expect (and yummy)
This is a great breakfast place. My friend had a delicious eggs Benedict, and I had a great croissant sandwich. I highly recommend it. The tea and coffee is really good too.
Sadly missed breakfast by 10mins or so (I was so looking forward to trying Le Croissant TMC thats been getting such rave reviews) Instead ordered the grilled cheese sandwich served with house-made (mom-made) apple gelee - PHENOMENAL! Hands down the BEST grilled cheese Ive ever had. In addition to the good coffee & great service, I look forward to returning here on my next visit :)so, So, SO GOOD!
We arrived at 11 and missed "breakfast." The only thing available were pre-made (but homemade) sandwiches that were pretty average. Very small location with a regular sized flat top stove. I was actually impressed they were able to run the entire menu from one small 4 burner stove (since the breakfasts appear to be quite involved). We chose our sandwich from the display case and it was pressed for us. Beef and some sort of horseradish sauce with some added greens. Simple. Did the trick to cure the hunger but nothing to write home about.
I read a lot of good reviews so decided to go. It was a an average experience. Eggs Benedicts only on weekends. The croissant was too soft. I think it's overrated
This staff at this cafe is so incredibly nice. We walked in and ordered several delicious croissants (chocolate hazelnut, almond and plain) and an egg muffin sandwich. When we got our order, one of the cashiers who may have been the manager/owner, not sure...came up to us and asked us abput our trip and if we needed any help with suggestions. He helped us figure out our day plans! We love this place! Wish they were open on Sunday. :)
Loved the croissant sandwich. However, the coffee is just okay.
4 of 4 stars (excellent, casual fare).(see explanation of ratings below)Great place for breakfast or lunch.  Talented baristas and excellent baked goods.Get the TMC: sliced hard-boiled egg with your choice of bacon or ham, your choice of cheese, lettuce and tomato on a lovely croissant.About $10-15 per person.About my ratings:Only high-priced dining establishments can garner five stars.  Until yelp realizes that a fast food joint cannot possibly be ranked equally with a $100 per person place, I need to draw the line somewhere.  If we were only talking about the quality and presentation of the food, it would be a different story.  But, as we know, yelp's rankings take into account the entire dining experience.Therefore, I divide restaurants into three categories (and I wish yelp would do the same):1) fast food and "fast-casual", low-priced (no table service).2) casual, mid-priced dining (table service, average entrée price: $10-$20).3) fine, high-priced dining (linen napkins, no plastic cups, no TV's in dining room, average entrée priced at more than $20, can vary depending on the city).High-priced dining can earn a max of five stars.  Mid-priced dining can earn a max of four stars.  Fast food can earn a max of three stars.
Almond croissant was excellent.   French toast a little too runny.  Coffee was bitter.  Person taking order was a bit stuffy and did not make the place really that inviting.  A little too French...not Montreal.
Great little cafe on the skirts of the old port. Friendly bilingual staff gets a 5/5- food and coffee is just perfect!
LOVED their latte bowls.  Food is  good to amazing.  Very chatty staff--which works well when it's not too busy.  Enjoyed it enough to come back twice in a weekend.
TMC Croissant with ham was delicious.  The croissant was a bit dry, but still very good.  Coffee was delicious and service was great.  We'll be back!
Attention Yelpers! My advice is simple: Go here. Staying nearby and desperately craving some early morning grub, this place has satiated my needs and then some a couple days running now. The bagels are fresh, yummy and oh-so-sesame. The breakfast sandwiches are delicious. But what will convince you to come back morning after morning are their creative and yummy croissants. Try the hazelnut chocolate and enjoy a few moments of scrumptious gluttony with your coffee.I also have to add that the service behind the counter is superb. The chef himself also came out behind the counter both mornings to check how things were! Love it!
The TMC croissant with ham and cheese was fantastic.  The coffee mocha was one of the best I've ever had and the lattes were outstanding.  They did not have a booster chair but were very accommodating to our 15 month old grandson.
It's true. The TMC Croissant. Get it!!  Amazing texture and burst of flavors. One of my favorite meals in Canada, coming from a NYC tourist :)
This was the worst experience ever.  soggy french toast.  I asked for a smoothie... then I watched from the table as he made an ice cream shake... which is not a smoothie.  A smoothie has fruit, he replaced the fruit with mango ice cream.  People are not stupid and we know when we are being lied to and it is obvious when a low class restaurant owner tries to pull the wool over our eyes and charge top dollar for it.   No salt and pepper on the tables.  bare bones for high dollar.  Very upset.  Took forever to get a coffee too... Can't believe there are any good reviews here.  It was obvious the owner/manager/whatever was trying to make everyone feel good by working his personality, but service sucked horribly.
This cafe is really conveniently located near a lot of hotels, so a good option for tourists looking for a quick breakfast. We came here hoping to get the dejeuner sur bagel (breakfast sandwich on a bagel) but unfortunately, they were finished serving breakfast by between 11 and 11:30am. I remain pretty unclear on when they stop serving breakfast. Instead, we got two bagels toasted with cream cheese, with sides of fruit salad (as suggested by the server). The bagels were pretty decent, but one was quite burnt, which was a bummer. The fruit salad was good, though. We also got one coffee and one cappuccino. I didn't try the coffee, but my boyfriend seemed to like it fine. The cappuccino was excellent.It didn't look like they had a great variety of enticing pastries or other offerings. The counter display was mostly filled with panini options.Service was friendly and the atmosphere was nice.
Good coffee.  Came a little late (11am) and most of the good pastries were gone.  Heavy volume traffic on a Sunday-- expect a wait for food and coffee.  Cute shop with friendly workers.
Our family was staying in a nearby hotel for the weekend, and we found the Cafe Mon on Yelp. The good reviews were spot on. Being early-rising Americans we arrived shortly after they opened at 9 on a Saturday, and basically had the place to ourselves. My kids ordered chocolate-filled croissants, my wife had the French toast, and I had the TMC croissant, which is a breakfast sandwich with sliced hard-boiled egg. All were excellent, and not a scrap was left at the end (after the wife and I finished what the kids couldn't).We also had large lattes that literally come in a bowl-sized coffee cup. They were also excellent, apparently owing in part to the ability to heat the milk and foam to a lower temperature than is required in the FDA-governed United States. Also, as you can see from the picture, our barista was an artist. Which brings me to my final compliment: as we were obviously tourists, and business was still quiet, our barista spent a lot of time visiting with us and offering local knowledge about Montreal. He managed to turn an already sublime breakfast into an extended great day. All in all, highly recommended. Care to guess where we'll be for breakfast again tomorrow?
My wife and I both had the TMC croissants and we both enjoyed them thoroughly. A nice gourmet touch to a late breakfast. The service is friendly but just know you'll have to order off the menu at the counter and pay there as well.
Amazing! The best word to describe the experience, food/cappuccinos and staff. We were in town for the weekend from Toronto and looking for a quick breakfast before heading back home. The staff was incredibly welcoming and helpful with selecting options to eat. We would recommend their signature croissant sandwich with homemade ingredients and a side of fresh fruit salad. We paired it with easily THE BEST CAPPUCCINO we've ever had. Perfect creama consistency and the foam was thick and flavorful. No sugar needed! Highly, highly recommend checking this place out for a quick bite. You won't be disappointed. PS- we even grabbed another Cappuccino on the way out to the airport. Who needs Starbucks??
Found this place on yelp while on a weekend trip. Outstanding service and amazing cofffee. The food was simple and tasty. Fantastic breakfast spot
Awesome spot -- my friends and I happened upon this place on Saturday morning -- with no advance notice, they were able to accommodate a group of 12 people. Everything was really tasty as well. I had the bacon benedict -- very highly recommended.
A great place to relax and grab some simple comfort food.  Exceptionally attentive and friendly staff.  Roast beef panini was amazing.
Some of the best coffee in the area, and the soup I'm eating right now is AMAZING. Very quiet little place. I don't want to post this review because I feel like this place is a secret... But they deserve the business.
My wife and I found this gem of a place in Old Montreal. It was so pleasant to eat at that we went back the next day before we had to head home to Calgary.The owners and their staff were super friendly and we enjoyed having conversation with them while we ate. Make sure you swing by this place for one of their panini sandwiches.
Get an espresso drink, the brewed coffee (café filtre) is mediocre and a little stale tasting.
Decent place to have breakfast and lunch in the area. Food is tasty and coffee well poured. Service is friendly.
Wonderful! I had the breakfast croissant which was simple yet perfectly seasoned. My wife's French toast pannetone was great though a little rich. Fresh fruit salad w mint was divine. The server / barista was great. Favorite breakfast place in Montreal.
We were pretty disappointed in this place after reading such rave reviews. The food and coffee were fine -- nothing special, but not bad. Maybe this is only a problem on Sunday mornings, but the service was unbelievably slow. Don't go here if you are at all in a hurry or just want to grab a quick pastry and coffee.
Friendly staff in a rather cold and echoey room. Mostly occupied by tourists and their naturally boisterous children. Made the mistake of ordering a latte and toatst&cheese notwithstanding the enthusiastic up-sell for Eggs Benedict and similar items. Received store bought spongy sliced bread and cheese and a surprisingly weak latte. I came here because of the excellent reviews but will not return.
Extremely great food and drinks. Lost a star due to being A bit pricey and so much if their menu was unavailable because they were out of ingredients. Recommend the TMC croissant and the Eggs Benedict with ham. BLT Bagel was good. Another from our party had poached eggs and toast and the eggs were done perfectly. The coffee drinks were flawless. Cappuccino was the best we have had in Montreal. If you have time check this place out. Go early so you don't have to deal with the out of stock issues on ingredients (we went at 1:00pm).
Enjoyed the best latte' I've ever had with a delicious chicken panini. Highly recommend
Most of the cafes and restaurants in the area are overpriced and under-deliver, but this one is an exception! Great sandwiches with a wide variety to choose from, with descent prices considering it's in Old Montreal. Highly recommended if you're in the area!
My husband and I took our 5 and 3 year old today. They could not have been nicer and we're great at explaining the menu. I had the egg and cheese sandwich on a bagel and my husband had the TMC sandwich. It was beyond tasty and filled us up without being heavy. Our kids had the muffins which were amazing. The lattes were exquisite. An all around wonderful experience for our first breakfast in Montreal.
Amazing egg Benedict but loses points on cleanliness and service.  Our order was wrong.  The fruit salad was moldy and there are plenty of flies all around.  Leaving ASAP.
Really nice discovery in old Montreal. Fresh, great value and very friendly. We had wonderful chicken avocado paninis. Iced coffee was top notch.
We were staying at the Westin around the corner and found this great breakfast spot right nearby. My 3 friends and I all ordered the TMC croissant with different combinations of cheese and meat, and all found it spectacular. If I were being very picky, I'd say the hard-boiled egg was slightly overcooked, but honestly it tasted great. We went in during a relatively quiet time and had a wonderful conversation with one of the employees about their drinks and food (apparently the TMC croissant is made with local cheese and a croissant made by a small bakery nearby). We also got to chat with the owner for a bit. Everybody was extremely friendly and service was pretty fast.They don't open until 9 on the weekends. Being an early-morning person myself, we went there at 8 one day in order to get an early start, only to discover that they were still closed. We came back the next day after a later night out and were very happy we did.
stopped in with friends for a latte on a cold day.  Great service, friendly people and perfect coffee... what else is there to say?
This is an excellent spot if you are looking for a quick breakfast that is simple yet delicious.  We ate there twice and each time the staff was pleasant and eager to please.  The prices are very reasonable and the ingredients are fresh.  Chapeau!
For my first breakfast in Montreal I searched Yelp for a location not too far from my hotel. Based on the stellar reviews I headed over to this cafe. The wait to order was about 15 minutes but being on vacation and not in a rush the wait didn't bother me. So when I was finally able to order I ordered 2 cafe au laits, a bagel with cream cheese and a bagel with egg, cheese and bacon. The bagel with cream cheese came out just fine, however the bagel for the bagel, egg, cheese and bacon was burnt. Literally, black. So I asked for another and that one was also burnt but more dark brown with a few areas of black. As I don't like to complain, I ate it, picking off the black burnt parts of the bagel. The egg, cheese and bacon were all excellent but I'm confused as to why my bagel was burnt, twice. My bill was $16 for 2 coffees and bagel sandwiches. Yelp let me down with this place. The cafes were just ok.
We loved our breakfast here. So fresh and flavorful! Coffee was excellent and that's coming from a NY coffee snob.
The TMC croissant is delicious and the moka is perfectly prepared. This place is a must stop for a quick bite!
Absolutely the best cappuccino in Montreal. If you are in Old Montreal, take the time to stop by this great cafe. Their Eggs Benedict are also amazingly perfect.
The Mon Cafe is a great place to start your day! We popped in for breakfast and had delicious croissant sandwiches and a fruit salad. Who knew croissant sandwiches could be so good?? My husband claims it's the best croissant sandwich he's ever tasted. Normally, he's an idiot, but I think he's right about this one.
The breakfast bagel was very good. As was the americano. Great place to go for a quick breakfast and a coffee!
Ordered the TMC breakfast sandwich and was pleasantly surprised. At first I was a little turned off with the egg being a sliced hard boiled egg but it was amazing. The mayo was homemade. The staff working that day was very friendly and funny. When the cook brought our food over he stayed and talked to us for a while. Great coffee! Will come back if I'm ever in Montreal again.
The cafe is great. The food was good, coffee was great, and the staff there was extremely friendly. One staff member spent 10 minutes with us going over the montreal map and giving his suggestions on where we should spend the day (we were tourists).
Great coffee, good croissant, but horrible service. Skip this place and head down to Le Cartet which is ten times better and  amazing service.
Came here for breakfast while staying nearby at the Westin Montreal during a four day trip. When we walked in, the waiter greeted us and exclaimed that they had the best coffee. I didn't know if that was a good sign but he was right, the coffee is amazing. The food is just as good. I had a croissant with hard boiled egg. It comes with ham but I asked for it without the ham. The waiter offered me a fruit salad instead which I accepted. Later, after paying the bill and leaving, I realized they had charged me for the fruit salad. I thought that was unfair as he had offered it as a substitution but then made me pay for it. However, the fruit salad was really good so not a huge deal. More about the principal of the matter.My hubby had the french toast with pannetone bread. I had a bite and wanted to order one myself! It was delicious! He also love the coffee.The waiter was very friendly and we enjoyed our breakfast and would recommend without hesitation.
A friendly place for a quick and delicious breakfast. After having ventured through the busy mess that was olive et gourmondo the prior morning, I was very happy to find this spot. Sadly, it was our last day! Next time I am back in Montreal, we will go back. Try the cm croissant sandwich!!
We ate breakfast here twice during our stay in Montréal. The food is fresh and made with loving care. And as a bonus, the proprietors only buy from local growers, so you know you are eating local, and supporting local. The coffee is to die for. We strongly recommend this little eatery to anyone looking for a charming place to sit and have a bite to eat, or just have an excellent coffee and a bit of good conversation with the owners. We will definitely return.
This is the perfect place to stop in for coffee, a heavy or light lunch. The beverage and pastry options are great, and the ingredients all great quality.
Fresh fresh fresh! We shared the avocado/blue cheese/spinach salad, as well as the salmon/arugula sandwich. Both portions were good, and the ingredients were high quality. Oh also, my sweetie had a coffee. Apparently, it was quite tasty.The salad was lovely, with tons of fresh spinach, big crumbles of blue cheese, a beautifully ripened  avocado  (sliced ), and several plump tomatoes.  The bread on the sandwich was perfectly toasted, the salmon was good and plentiful. It came with a mixed  bean salad.Overall, the food was good, but it needed a little something more... more dressing for the salad, more aioli for the sandwich, more anything for the bean salad... even a quick spritz of lemon could've helped. The service and atmosphere were nice, and the restroom was fine. We weren't able to connect to their WiFi for some reason.This is a good place to stop if you want some clean eating... and apparently also if you want crepes, though we didn't try them.
Great restaurant to start your day, whether you're just picking up coffee to go or sitting down for a meal.The staff was very friendly and helpful. Just order at the counter and then take a seat, they'll bring your food out when it's ready. I had the special breakfast burger, which was really good. They have a cool orange juice machine that looks a bit like a Rube Goldberg machine, you can watch as it squeezes your juice right out of the oranges. It's probably a pain to maintain it, but the juice was great and it was fun to watch. Plus, how can you beat fresh-squeezed OJ?
Cafe Veritas is a wonderful local cafe in the heart of Old Montreal. Very open layout, with lots of seating, free wifi, and a large menu. The menu consists mostly of sandwiches and salads, with some crepes and typical coffee shop drinks. The hot chocolate is delicious here and the service is very friendly!
Healthy, friendly, and delicious! Would definitely stop by again for the soup, salad, or sandwich. Definitely would get the coffee again!
Nice place to grab a quick healthy bite. Food seem a bit uneven, I had a pulled pork wrap, which was the special of the day, and I liked it. 11$99 and it came with a salad, worth it. Some people were with me and I was not so enthusiast about the other things I tried, breakfast wrap was a bit plain and boring. And the crepe with fresh fruit was disappointing too. A mocka to pass this all down, average. Quick and efficient service, fruits and veggies seem fresh enough.
A big healthy menu and the food is really fresh and delicious! The price is right and it's smack in the middle of tourist zone so that is a great surprise. Got the broccoli soup, breakfast wrap and the chicken avocado and arugula sandwich that comes with a fresh salad. Definitely recommend what we ordered because it was very good and healthy.
My husband and I came in here for a coffee and lunch. I ordered the sesame baked chicken salad and a cappuccino. The service was helpful and friendly, my cappuccino art was beautiful and the salad was fresh and delicious. If you are craving some healthy eats and delicious coffee in Montreal this is the place to hit up. I'm coming back for breakfast tomorrow.
We had the mushroom omelette and grilled cheese panini. The omelette taste very fresh. The grilled cheese was so tasty and buttery. It melted in your mouth. Service was quick. The place is clean. It's very chic. It does have free wifi, all you have to do is ask them for the password. The prices are good as well. Overall I am satisfied.
Nice spot, air-conditioned and casual. Americano was so-so apparently the bagles are amazing though! Enormous salads, the avocado salad was a killer. Really like the blue cheese instead of standard chevre they used in that one. Not to expensive and the staff is nice, and if I may say so myself,  quite beautiful as well, always a plus.
Crepe taste creepy! Very dry and not juicy at all. Disappointed since it has high stars in yelp right now.
We had two veggie sandwiches, both choices were disappointing. They lacked flavour and were blend. The eggplant in one sandwich was not good for consumption anymore and the tofu sandwich could have used a better sauce. It's nice we had salad with the sandwiches (salad was nice) but the sandwiches had too little ingredients.... Overall, we don't believe we'll return to this place. But this being said, service was good and perhaps the meat sandwiches are better.
I used Yelp to find this cafe when I was looking for a sit down place that serves coffee in real mugs and not paper cups. Yelp didn't let me down. I had a fabulous crepe along with a cappuccino. Service was excellent and very friendly.
I had just finished running an intense 3-day meeting in Montreal, was hungry and needed good food in a low key setting. Thank you, Yelp, you came through again. Veritas was just the ticket. Previous reviews pointed me to the veggie and feta cheese sandwich - best ever? - and the coffee was strong and delicious. Friendly, efficient staff in a bright, cheerful setting. I can't recommend this place more.
Breakfast flat bread sandwiches are great.  I ordered the ham and cheese omelette flat bread sandwich. Very light but filling with fresh ingredients.
Absolutely amazing! This is not an upscale place but it's just perfect for a hearty lunch that won't break the bank. I ordered their veggie mozzarella panini sandwich which came with a lovely chickpea salad. I am usually not the type to finish my entire meal but after a horrible lunch at some upscale hotel down the street, I finished the entire sandwich AND salad (and that is after already "having lunch")This is not a tourist trap and you will get your money's worth. It's clean and healthy and affordable.
The cafe is near old port Montreal. I ordered an Americano and a scone for my afternoon tea. It was lucky that I found this cafe when carrying heavy loads walking around old Montreal.The atmosphere here is okay but what I ordered are all good. Even better than Starbucks. It's cheap for most of cafes in old Montreal .
sandwiches taste really great, crepes, coffee are good as well. Most food on the menu looks heathy and delicious. Great environment, walking distance to old montreal, and the church.  Price is not expensive at all, service is good.I definitely will go there again.
Awesome place for gourmet sandwiches, crepes and coffee.  Step away a few steps from the old town touristy cafés and you will be very happy you did:-).  Great prices, great food accompanied by great service.
Fantastic coffee, food and service. Came here during a break in a conference - the perfect spot for a quick sandwich (I had the chicken avocado, my colleague the chicken pesto) - and coffee.Our sandwiches were done on an almost flat crunchy bread, once out of the press - plenty of avocado and flavor in mine.Ordered a latte - it was delicious! Highly recommend this spot.
I had cheese bagel with salmon and BLT sandwich. Taste awful.
Great service, very good coffee, simple and delicious lunch fare. In a hood filled with tourist traps and fine but pricey dining, it's good to have a place like this to rely on.
It's always great when you can have a healthy option that' also happens to be delicious. This is definitely one of hose places and to make matters even better, this service is excellent.Stopped in here for lunch after wanting something fairly healthy. I got the chicken pesto panini sandwich which also comes with peppers. It's was absolutely delicious and to make it better its all organic and low in fat. The sandwich wasn't drowning in pesto and even the breast tastes extremely fresh.The lady who works there could not have been more pleasant and accommodating. She explained almost everything on the menu in detail and went out of her to present it in English since I'm American. Couldn't ask for a better overall experience. Ill absolutely be back!
spent some time with friends here on a recent trip to Montreal. Cappuccino was very refreshing after a long day's walk around the old town.
I've only been here once and it certainly did not wow me enough to return. I had a chocolate and banana crepe. I enjoyed it as much as any other run of the mill crepe. This could be a case of ordering the wrong item on the menu, but I am a bit perplexed by some of the more favorably enthusiastic reviews.
My sister and I ate here on our first day in Montreal. My sister ordered a chicken-cranberry salad that looked out of this world. I ordered the crepes with ham/asparagus/swiss. My crepe had a touch of sweetness that I didn't care for in what I expected to be a savory dish, but it was cooked well. This is a nice casual eatery, with healthy options. I would return...and order the salad. Our meals with drinks cost $30 CAD.
Nothing special, just a place to get a quick and healthy bite to eat. Disappointed that the Orange and carrot juice wasn't fresh squeezed, the price indicted as such.
My wife and I drove 6 hours fron NY to Old Montreal. We were famished on arrival and as vegetarians we needed to find the right place. Well we sure did at Cafe Veritas. A large selection to choose from, well prepared food and delicious !!. The service was wonderful. Highly recommended.
Great place for soups, salads or breakfast . I had a huge breakfast here for only $9 and it was only $1 more for a delicious coffee to go with it! The service was great and the atmosphere very comfortable. Plenty of room and big windows .
lovely casual place. but the wifi didn't work for me.bummer that crepes are only served for breakfast!!! till 11.30am. salads looked huge.sandwiches are delicious. thanks to the lady's recommendation, i ordered the chicken avocado & arugula.THE BREAD. omgosh. hello there. soft not overbearing. scrumptious by itself or with the sandwich. give me more please. it also came with a small side of quinoa mixed with cucumbers, dressing, red cabbage, etc.
Good prices. The coffee was very good. They steam the milk automatically for your coffee. Bagel with cream cheese was very good, best part of meal, ordered a side of smoked salmon. Crepe with berries was good too. Roasted potatoes with omelette were a miss, season and flavor were wrong for a breakfast/brunch. Omelette was not good, more of a frittata than omelette. I should of used salt and pepper but did not. Egg flavor was off.
Excellent lunch here. I had the Grilled Veggie Sandwich and even asked if they could swap the cheese out for avocado. They were pleasant and easy to work with! The sandwich was delicious. I also had a cranberry orange smoothie, flavor was great but a little too much pulp for me at the end. Clean, inviting restaurant. Definitely recommended for lunch!
Cappuccino was excellent. Free wifi. Sandwiches are very expensive, the highest prices I've seen in Montreal. Perhaps is normal for the old port, but $11 for a sandwich is crazy.
Fun space, tasty food and super friendly staff. However, several choice salad options were unavailable because the kitchen was understaffed when I arrived.
The interior appears to have been renovated in approximately 2008 and is starting to look dated. Large menu of paninis, lunch-type food. Coffee was acceptable, a touch better than chain fare but on the whole uninteresting - if you're not pressed for time, Café 1880 on St-Denis or Pourquoi Pas on Amherst are superior options in this part of the city.
Good food at a good price!  I had the Tomato, basil and mozzarella sandwich, which was delicious.  They challenged me to compare their cafe mocha to that 'other' coffee shop's version and I must say it was very good!  If I return to Montreal, I will visit this place again!
Good food, very fresh, and super-nice staff! The wifi works better if you sit in the main part of the cafe. If you sit down near the door, the signal is variable.They also have TVs up showing images of beautiful places and happy people. Very soothing.The salad with avocado and cranberries is fantastic. Even in the dead of winter, the produce is wonderfully fresh.We come here for breakfast and lunch several times each trip we take to Montreal. And the staff remembers us year to year, which is even nicer!
So... this place is DEFINITELY NOT vegan.  And not vegetarian either.  It has vegetarian options, which I suppose makes it practically vegan in Montreal, but still.The vegetarian options they do have, though, are wonderful.  And you can read it in French or English!  I got the Mediterranean salad, for $10 CA, and it was wonderful.  Big and delicious, with massive chunks of feta and juicy kalamata olives.  All the other salads that came out looked great too, and I realized too late that they had my favorite soup-- corn chowder.Easy walking distance from the Palais des Congres... and right next to Subway.  Makes you wonder how Subway could possibly get any business at all... Unless patrons are turned away by the slightly-treacherous step down to the restrooms.  Completely logical.
Very good and healthy options.  Staff was so friendly, kind and considerate.  Close to Palace de Congres for lunch break.
Excellent food and great service! :)  We are traveling from the US and they had English menus which made ordering their great food much easier.
I did a whole lot of research to find a suitable brunch spot for both my husband and I for our first morning in Montreal. Since it was a Sunday and a holiday weekend, the place we originally wanted to go to was closed. However, I found a highly rated café quite close to our hotel that offers vegan, vegetarian and non-veg brunch items. Café Veritas popped up in almost all of my searches for a casual but reputable brunch location in Old Montreal.Well, Café Veritas was easy to find. . . I love how their sign connotes it's healthful and fresh cuisine concept.The inside was very cool--kind of modern and sleek. The menu offerings were posted sort of like you would find in a food court--with pictures--but believe me when I say the atmosphere was far from food court!We found ourselves a cozy little corner table., and went to the counter to order.  The woman who took our order was so nice!According to what I read online, Café Veritas aims to serve more healthful cuisine. They have tons of salads and sandwiches, as well as crepes and oatmeal. They're also quite well-known for their coffee beverages and coffee art. Rather than get a fancy latte though, I stuck with a simple cup of black coffee.I ordered their "porridge" cooked in soymilk, with banana, raisins, and walnuts. It also came with honey, but since all of their food is made to order, I requested no sweetener and they happily obliged.I have to tell you a few things about this breakfasty bowl of goodness. First, this porridge Is advertised as cooked in soymilk, which made it vegan from the get-go. I didn't have to ask for the soymilk--it is normally prepared that way! Second, it was the best oatmeal I have ever eaten in my life. Step aside Le Pain Quotidien. . . there's another amazing oatmeal bowl in town!The soymilk made it beyond creamy, and while it was a tad more liquidy than I am used to, it made it have a texture like rice pudding! The bananas and raisins provided the right amount of sweetness, and the walnuts gave a nice crunch. The serving size was perfect too--not too much, not too little.My husband ordered whole wheat crepes with ham and cheese, and he also though his food was fantastic--it was light and fresh and satisfied him without weighing him down.Café Veritas is so yum-- I would recommend it to anyone looking for a healthy breakfast, lunch, or brunch, but it is especially great for those who don't eat meat or dairy as well. They don't even charge extra if you want your latte made out of soy, which is quite a rarity, as most places do charge extra for soymilk.
Very decent espresso. Selection of vancouver roasted coffees. Nice space and friendly service. Recommend!
I was looking for a place with healthier options and just happened to walk by. This place has a great selection on sandwiches and salads. Being a vegetarian it tends to be harder to eat out when you don't know the area, but Cafe Veritas had a good vegetarian selection.  Since the menu has pictures, it's very easy to select something tasty. The service was also very quick and helpful. I would recommend this place for a coffee break or lunch.
I really enjoyed their veg sandwitch(Légume Grillés et Fromage de Chèvre). Avacado Salad is decent. Service is prompt and prices are cheap given the location.
Amazing sandwiches and salads... And one of the best coffees in town. I am very picky about my coffees and I must say this is very close to Myriad. Highly recommend this place if you want decent good quality food and don't want to be ripped!
Food seemed very fresh and everything was tasty. Between all of us we were able to try the fruit crepes and the banana hazelnut crepes as well as a bagel and egg sandwich and a very fresh fruit cup. The food was served quickly and it was all very good. The only thing that was a negative is that I wasn't a big fan if the coffee, but I had drop coffee and not any if the espresso offerings that smelled so good.
You know what I like? Paninis. And you know what else I like? Coffee.Done, and done. Delicious food, amazing service, and fair prices at this very cozy spot surrounded by tourist traps and subpar food joints.
Great atmosphere, ideal place to go if you are looking for a quiet place with a nice decor and a relaxing music. The menu covers salads, paninis, hot and cold drinks.
If you're staying in Vieux Montreal and you're going broke because of all of the fantastic (read: expensive) dining by night, save some coin during the day by heading to Cafe Veritas for breakfast.  Really tasty, healthy options.  And soooo affordable too!  2 yummy egg sandwiches on bagels=$8 CAD.  The staff is friendly.  The atmosphere's clean and cozy too.
A good place to go if you want to get away from tourists in the old montreal area. It has vegetarian food with is definitely a plus. Also the music is good.
Modern resto cafe in a great location. They have the average salad/sandwich fare (with veg options which is nice), but perhaps takes attention away from the coffee. Ordered a ristretto and an americano with less water. The cashier was a little confused but the barista seemed more knowledgable, although still gave me a cup filled to the top with water for the americano. They're using 49th parallel which is generally good but both coffees tasted over extracted and were served in paper cups. Overall an average experience-maybe a visit earlier in the day would have been better.
Nice music, great location.
If you are a coffee lover, DON'T go here.  Although its quite true that the decor is really modern and nice inside, the coffee is terrible.  I didn't try anything on the menu, but will never go back here again.
Great ambiance. Reasonable prices. Friendly staff. Almost everything can be made to be vegetarian végétarienne or vegan so the menu  which consists mostly of salads and hot sandwiches is great. Beer, coffee, orange juice and carrot juice ir served so there is something for everyone. I recommend
This place was great!  The kids had bagels and cream cheese, even though they weren't  serving breakfast. My wife and I split paninis one salmon and one basil pesto chicken, both came with a small salad. They were both delicious and the service was very good. It was a very hot day, and the AC was excellent as were the comfy chairs after a morning of walking around Old Montreal.
Stopped by for coffee over the weekend. Well-made cappuccinos. Modern, clean décor. Friendly service from the gentleman behind the counter (the owner perhaps?)
First time reviewer of anything, but I do consult these kind of sites when wanting to try something new. As a regular at Veritas, when I came across some of these bad reviews, I decided to finally write a post for all the Veritas regulars out there. I take a detour at least 3-4 times a week to get a cappuccino from Veritas on my way to work. The caps here as good as it gets and I've always been greeted with a smile. Whenever I can, I pass by for a meal here and it's been consistently great. So, for all you haters out there, I don't get it.
My sister was in town and we were on our way to Old Port to walk around and were starving. We found Cachitos through Yelp and decided to try it.We walk in not entirely knowing what to expect. We are immediately welcomed and offered a sample because she could tell we didn't really know what we were ordering. We got a ham and cheese, guava and cheese, and spinach and ricotta. All of them were incredible! The sweet and savory mix of the guava and cheese was especially delicious, all should try that one.On top of the Cachitos, we got a Bonbon espresso with condensed milk and a macchiato. The espresso was definitely the favorite, as it was so sweet with the condensed milk but still packed the good espresso punch. The macchiato was also very good, but very strong, so beware if you're looking for something sweeter or more dessert-like.The service was absolutely the best part of Cachitos though. They helped us choose what to get and how much, were very speedy, and obviously loved seeing us try their homemade authentically Venezuelan food. An experience in itself and I will definitely be returning!
We took out two cachitos, spinach and cheese. I love the spinach one, and the cheese one is also yummy.The lady there is really nice. When she heard we were first time there, she gave us a slice of the cheese cachito to taste.Unfortunately, I ate them before I realised I forgot to take pictures...
BonBon ($2.25) Espresso with Condensed Milk might be one of my favourite espresso drink as dessert.I were more impressed with the espresso drinks at Cachitos than the actual "cachitos" which we ordered were both underwhelming. Spinach with ricotta and parmesan/Jamon y queso (ham and cheese).Sugar Cane Juice though was refreshing on a hot day.
Wow! I had the Ham and Cheese cachito (literally straight out of the oven), a passionfruit tartlet and a dulce de leche cupcake.....so good! The Cachito was soft, crunchy and sweet and the filling was delicious. I'll be back tomorrow to try the chorizo!The owner and the other guy working their were super helpful and sweet even though I couldn't speak french!
I was very happy to discover Cachito's in Montreal. It was authentically Venezuelan. The service was very friendly. The food simple, but tasty. Cachito's is on my to-do list for the next trip to Montreal.
Cachitos is a great place to go for lunch. You walk in and there are a couple of tables and a glass case full of the "cachitos". The cachitos are really good, interesting, fancier hot pockets.  You have your choice of many different types, from ham and cheese, to spinach and ricotta and even dessert types. We got the ham and cheese, spinach and ricotta, a special chicken one (don't remember the name), and the home-made chorizo one. Our favorites were the ham and cheese and spinach and ricotta.  The roll-ups and all freshly made and are quite filling.  This is a unique (Venezuelan-type), cheap walk-up food place. Very interesting place to try.
Yummy pretzel-like dough wrapped around filling of your choice.  We had the Bacon & Ham, and Ham & Cheese, along with mini lemon and lime tartletts.  Warm, slightly chewy, ample filling. They were still warm!  Very Satisfying breakfast!  Bought five more to take home with us.
Delicious, easy to get to and inexpensive? Where do I sign up?!?  I wish I found this place earlier in my visit to Montréal.  I highly recommend the Ham & Cheese or the Chorizo cachitos.  Meat, cheese stuffed in a soft bread is my kind of meal.  If you enjoy a slight sweet taste, the Guava & cheese cachito is the way to go.  You will not be disappointed.
Be prepared to release your urge to eat healthy if you go here, but it is so worth it! My fiancee and I stumbled across this place on Christmas morning and were so happy we did. It was packed and rightfully so. I am vegetarian so I tried the guava and cheese cachito and the spinach and ricotta, both were delicious. My fiancee tried the pork and chicken and loved them both. We also tried the cafechito, which I didn't really care for. But it's a delicious, unique breakfast def worth trying!!
These things are delicious. We came both days that we were in Montreal during our last stay. There's quite a few different flavours, and they are in the $3-4 range. I think one per person is good for bfast. We shared a few different types and all were good. Tastes kind of like a cross between a croissant and a pretzel I'd say. Staff is friendly. Accepts credit
My wife and I found this place convenient to the Hyatt while on a quick holiday to Montreal. The owner greeted us as we walked in and offered a sample of a delicious hot, cheese filled bread. That set the hook. We ordered a hot ham and cheese bread and a couple BonBon cafés. The food and drinks were great and we will be back without a doubt... very tasty food and coffees.
Great little local Venezuelan food. Owners are exceptionally friendly. The chicken stew and guava cheese cachitos are amazing. Definitely recommend for a new experience.
not gonna lie, I was a bit skeptical about the rave reviews -- place doesn't really look like anything spectacular -- but I was hungry, and though I'm on a tight budget I really don't want to eat in freakin' McDonald's in Montreal, so I decided to give it a try, and was not at all disappointed.as others have said, when I came in the guy manning the counter asked if I'd had cachitos before, and when I said no he offered me a sample of the basic cheese one (delicious).  I got the lunch combo -- two cachitos, soup or salad, drink for something like 10.24 -- with ham & cheese and chorizo & cheese, and couldn't even finish (not for lack of trying, but those things are FILLING); one (under $4) would probably be enough for breakfast or a smallish lunch.  I'm only in town for a few more days and may come back for breakfast or to try one of the sweet ones.  super nice people, super delicious, convenient, cheap -- what's not to love?
So delicious. And very friendly service. Had the salmon, and ham and cheese. My son was blown away... "Whoa, do they make these in the US?" Maybe Cachitos will expand across the border.
holy molly how cool is this placenot only the cachitos are great and make me oh so home sick for my natal venezuela but in addition to the typical ham and cheese cachitos they have a plethora of more exotic ones that are sure to pleasethe coffee is pretty fantastic toodo yourself a favor and tried the cafechitoand service is very friendly to boota little piece of venezuela in montreal
A tasty variety of cachitos.  They are inexpensive and tasty but you might have to eat more than one if you don't want to be hungry after. Many of them were hot and for a flavor that was sold out, they were happy to make a new batch and they were ready in 15 minutes.
I wish we had this in Toronto! Came here for a quick breakfast on two days out of our four day trip to Montreal. Staff was friendly and cachitos were freshly made. Smoothies were good too!
Delicious! And super energetic owners/employees. Lovely little shop with cachitos* and pastries. They don't hesitate to make suggestions - my spinach and ricotta was scrumptious, warm, and perfect with whatever small dipping sauce they provided. Love that the same pastries come in both bite size and regular size (my lemon tart was the perfect sweet tangy finish). 'twas a great recommendation (the lady told me her favorite & the best selling goods). Also, there's wifi that works, ac, good coffee, & a chill vibe. Makes me want to study here despite being on vacation. Oh, and did I mention that they were on the front page of montreal's gazette today?! Made me smile to see how stoked they were! Happiness is contagious. *Cachito - [kah-chee-toh] a small horn shaped bread native to Venezuela, that is traditionally filled with ham or cheese
My trip to Montreal may have ended and I am no longer in the area, but fond memories of my brunch at Cachitos keep playing over and over again in my head.  They have excellent customer service, welcoming you and offering a sample as soon as you walk through the door, enticing you to order.  I ordered the Combo that comes with 2 cachitos (I chose beef and the Spinach-Ricotta), a lentil soup and a beverage.  Everything was really good.  The lentil soup will literally warm you from the inside out.  I really liked the Spinach-Ricotta cachito, but the beef one was a bit dry.   You definitely need the mayo sauce they give you on the side for dipping.  The above fed two of us and we were quite happy-full.   With an extra order of a caffe and a bite-sized dulce de leche cupcake, our bill rang us up to only $13 for all of this deliciousness!  Seating is limited, so you may have to have a backup plan to take out in case all the tables and chairs are filled.
First of all let me say that this was one of the most pleasant surprises of Montreal. The store itself is quaint and run by very friendly staff. The staff were helpful and eager to let us try samples before buying. The food itself is all homemade and each different cachito is delicious. The drinks are also refreshing and scrumptious. Definitely a must have when visiting Montreal. Love it!
Cachitos is fabulous!! As soon as you enter in the place, you get to smell freshly baked bread. It smells even better than in all the other bakeries. Then, the super friendly staff will explain you what is a cachito - a sort of baguette filled with cheese, or meat, etc. So much better than anything I could have expected. Perhaps because it was late and the afternoon and I was very hungry, but it was really one of the most delicious thing I've got to eat in my life. And by the way, their coffee is awesome!! ;)
Cachitos are delicious sandwhich-like snacks! Although small compared to what I expected, they are great for tasting various flavors in one sitting. The salmon as well as their cheese cachitos are simply delicious.I believe the staff is partly composed of family members and they were not only very informative about their unique product, but they also were a delight to talk to. I would highly recommend you give this place a try, especially since, as far as I know, there is no other place to get Cachitos in Montreal!
great choriqueso, lime tarts and limonade made with sugar cane, the owner and staff are super friendly too!
though the concept is fairly new for me...cachitos was a pleasant experience...we went there on consecutive days during our montreal visit...sugar cane lemonade...and the coffee...were to die for...very friendly staff...the best part is they do not cook them in bulk and store it for display...at any time u can find a max of three cachitos of a kind...you have to wait for 10 mins to get a fresh batch and its totally worth the wait...they have close 10 different varietals on the offer including the savory and sweet kind...hot melting cheese with meat/veggies on the inside  inside with the soft bread and a nice bake crunch on the outside.
I wasn't sure what to expect but went there anyway since it had such good reviews. It's a small family business and the cachitos are all freshly baked. The food was delicious and well worth the price. Very friendly staff (we got free drinks!).
Every single morning of our trip to Montreal, we visited Cachitos. They are the best new thing I have tried, so savory but yet sweet depending on the ones you try. My favorite were the spinach and ricotta and the chorizo. The owners and staff members are very knowledgeable and friendly, we were given a sample of their Cachitos when we first found the place, as well as their pure sugar cane sweet lemonade. Delicious. I really hope Carmen and Lilliana make a move down to New York City, because I would be in there every morning for one.
We stayed at a hotel about two blocks away. Found this spot through Yelp. Awesome for breakfast. Neighborhood appears unsafe so I wouldn't recommend walking during off-peak hours. There are homeless people here and there. Avoid eye contact! Once you entered the establishment, all is well. Friendly staff. We never had a cachitos so the server sliced sample pieces for us. It was delicious. Small pastries with different kind of fillings and cheese in it. Sorta like a empanada. For $3.50, it is a pretty damn good deal. We tried the beef and the chorizo. Both of them are good. The pastry part is warm and soft, cheese is just the right amount without overpowering the meat, and the meat is well seasoned. It comes with a mayo garlic type sauce. Done. Good for breakfast. Good for afterwork snack. Get it with a cup of coffee. Will definitely return...
Wasn't sure what to expect, never had Venezuelan food before - this was incredible though. Spectacularly well prepared, very friendly staff, and the Frappes are a pleasantly great surprise. Lots of vegetarian options, the soup was good, and if you come between 11-15:00 you can get two cachitos, a drink, and soup for $9. Not bad at all and well worth the price!
I went into this with medium expectations. How amazing could a cachito be? Well, the answer is...super amazing! We tried the ham and cheese. So soft and warm. Great treat to go! Really friendly staff, as well. Good value for something so tasty.
I saw a lot of good reviews on Yelp and bookmarked it before we went to Montreal. Its a great little place. Very tasty. Its good for breakfast and snack as its not suited for anything else. They have couple of tables inside and outside. I had cheese and chicken with some sort of pastry...very different and tasty. Very friendly owners..they seems to be very busy during early afternoon...snack time...I recommend it. You have to try..
Unique and authentic stuffed "pies" from Venezuela. Delicious.I recommend the ham and cheese filled cachitos. So yummy. You think you've tried foods of the world? You must try these. Plus the staff is very friendly and helpful. Essayez quelque chose de nouveau. Yum.
We went here twice in the week we were visiting Montreal and had a great experience both times. The staff was friendly and welcoming from the moment you walk through the door, all smiles and speaking french, english , and spanish! The cachitos are prepped and baked fresh here and they consist of a super soft long roll stuffed with delicious fillings like chorizo, ground beef, chocolate, or chicken and cheese...we had all of the above and enjoyed every single bite! They also have great pastries, smoothies,and coffee. This is a cute little shop with a few seats inside in a bit of a sketchy area but not unsafe in any way. They seem to appeal to both business men/women & also the local construction workers...I am guessing because it's fresh, quick, delicious, and served with a great attitude from a happy crew.
Wow, very glad my girl found this place. Their bagels are amazing. They cook them perfectly and have so many varieties inside, you will fine what you crave for sure. It is a very small shop but you can tell they love what they do. trust them when they make a recommendation for you.
small baked bread with various stuffs: cheese, bacon, chocolate etc. would definitely go there again
In-house chorizo is definitely worth while.  Cafechito coffee with condensed milk is a real treat.  Americans may think they see a bagel-dog, but they need to realize that this bread is perhaps 75% baguette, 15% croissant (some kind of butter or egg white on the exterior), and 10% magic.  We liked the art hanging on the restaurant walls, so the proprietors asked us to see the murals on the downstairs walls. Cachitos takes "gracious" and "charming" to the next level.  Nowhere in Montreal did I see anyone cooler than the guy with the Stetson hat, Oakley sunglasses, biker's leather jacket, and a kilt.
Looked interesting and so we decided to hit it up with a bunch of friends.  Saw the rave reviews on Yelp and sure enough--it was good.  But it's just cheese in a pastry.  Nothing special.  They're pretty small too.  I paid 13$ for two cheese in pastries.  But hey, it seemed authentic and the owners were friendly.  Really, I just expected more.
This Cafe/Restaurant should make any Venezuelan proud of their food. The Cachitos are not only extremely good, but a true representation of the Venezuelan ones. I would actually say that they are even better than some cachitos you would find in Venezuela itself.I would recommend this to anyone for any occasion at any time. Please try the Jugo de Papelon con Limon.Thanks to the staff and Liliana for the service they gave us, and also for making us Venezuelans in Canada proud of our origins and food.
It is one of the best pastry shops I have ever been to.  The staff are friendly, the atmosphere is welcoming, and the cachitos are delicious!  I went to this place because of the reviews on Yelp, and I have to say it has lived up to its reputation.
Was walking around the area and found this...well worth it! Reasonable prices, and extremely filling! The cachitos are absolutely incredible.
Great place for am awesome quick breakfast.    The cachitos were great and include an amazing dip that you will learn to love.    Everything is warm and the workers are super friendly.    You really should try this place out.
Cachitos are delicious, and the owners have created a beautifully designed and immaculate space. I had the guava and cheese cachito, and it was a fantastic combination. If you're looking for something new and different for a light breakfast or lunch, this is a must-visit.
I can't vouch for Venezuelan authenticity, but these cachitos were delicious!  Think of freshly baked , warm from the oven bread stuffed with tasty combinations of ricotta and spinach, or ham, or salmon, or chicken.  All modestly priced at $3 each.  Everything, including desserts, are made onsite.
Out of this world desserts. We got a box of four gorgeous pastries as well as a canele and croissant. Everything was incredibly tasty and picture-perfect! A bit pricey, but worth it for the ingredients and the attention to detail in presentation. Lots of families enjoying brunch/lunch when we dropped in. That will have to wait for our next trip!
The Maison Christian Faure Pastry School is run by Chef Christian Faure Meilleurs Ouvriers de France, and is located in the Old Montreal area.  This place is an on-site bakery and snacking area in which the chef and his team offers a variety of classic and contemporary desserts.  In addition, there are also baking/pastry classes that you can sign-up and register for that's offered to the public.  I stopped by to check out their cake selections, and behind the glass casing, they were really pretty to look at.  I decided on a Framboisette, a little cake that was dusted with powdered sugar with a raspberry puree-covered dome made out of chocolate mousse, and encased with a decorative white chocolate.  There was even a small little white flower set to close this wrap-around 'case.'  I wasn't really much of a fan of the cake base, as it was dense and dry; the raspberry encased dome was much better, but it was more chocolate mousse-based, rather than the raspberries.  The little cafe area was bright and white, with plastic chairs and a minimal space for those who wanted to dine-in.  There are also sandwiches and lunch specials that you can order off the menu.  Service was friendly and quick, and you pay up at the bakery case after you're done.+pastry school that offers sandwiches, pastries, and desserts
3.5/5*Don't go for brunch, go for the pastries and dessert. *Brunch is overpriced or the portion isn't justifiable for the price. *The bakery compasses a baking school, workshops. *The chef is a MOF - Meilleur Ouvrier de France - meaning he has been tested at the highest level for his baking skills. *The shop is small and cute. Tables are a bit too close together, can get uncomfortable. *Don't come here and expect excellent service. -Lobster and Royal Crab served in a choux pastry - $18The choux pastry was so dry and chewy that I didn't finish it, thus I was quite disappointed to see that a French bakery would fail to make a choux pastry.. With that said, there were good chunks of lobster and crab meat, and the light mayonnaise didn't overpower the delicate seafood and still let their natural sweetness come through.-Brunch on the plank  - $20 it was such a small portion for $20. I didn't try the egg benedict since it was tiny - but friend said it was good, and the brioche was delicious and decadent. However I thought I could have gotten something more substantial with that price point.-Traditional mille-feuille - $6The name of mille-feuille translates into a "thousand sheets" - which refer to the layers of the puff pastry. All I have to say is that this mille-feuille was heavenly! Crisp, crunchy buttery layers of puff pastry that crackle when you bite into them. The slight glaze on the first layer of the pastry gave that hint of sweetness. Alternated with a velvety smooth pastry cream. The perfect combination and contrast between crunch and silky smooth. Buttery and sweet.-Chocolate eclair - $6The pastry was light and airy, filled with a rich and luscious chocolate cream. Seriously, is there anything better than the mildly sweet, rich, and chocolaty goodness of an eclair? If you are a dark chocolate lover, you will definitely enjoy this pastry. However for myself, I wished there was another flavor in the pastry cream to complement the rich chocolate.
Per Doctor Elsie W.'s review, we came here again. This past weekend might have been my third time in this place.I recommend the croissants with cream inside, along with the lemon tart, apple crumb cake, and cappuccino! If you're driving from New York City, try to make this your final stop before departing so you can bring lots of baked goods back!I saw a brunch menu, too, and I am looking forward to devouring everything when I come back again.Parking can get difficult on this block, so park around the corner by the public meters and just walk back. Walking sounds easy, but not in negative six degrees Fahrenheit before wind chill!
I am conflicted about this the rating of this review because the desserts and baked goods were delicious, but the service was just so deplorable that it ruined our experience here. And let me tell you that I was very much looking forward to the day that I would be in a patisserie of a MOF (Meilleur Ouvrier de France). Quiet day in Old Montreal and this place was one of the few open shops when we came. Sneak a peek downstairs and you can see croissants proofing. The entrance just smells wonderful. The displays are perfect and organized. All staff are bilingual. You can choose a table to sit at, and the staff comes with a tray of pastries and desserts with a description of each. This seemed like a nice service...however after placing our order, we requested water as our drink and the female staff rolled her eyes! While waiting for our order, a male staff comes with the same tray and asked what we wanted. I clearly said, "We already ordered." and he proceeds to question what I want and I was quite confused at this point. He wasn't nice about it either and kept pressing. Then the female staff notices what is happening and tells her co-worker in French that we have already ordered. Desserts are fairly priced and what you would typically expect for a higher end bakery/patisserie. Croissants were crispy on the outside, soft and had a nice distribultion of air bubbles on the inside. Flan was very smooth and not too sweet or eggy. The eclair Paris-Brest was absolutely amazing. The hazelnut cream, with the hazelnuts and choux pastry was heavenly. Treat yourself! The pastries get 6 stars. All in all, terrible service for such a nice establishment in a touristic area and it wasn't even busy that day. Such a shame because the pastries are amazing.
As someone who doesn't drink coffee, you may not be surprised I didn't like this place. They couldn't accommodate a request for a Chai Latte so I skipped straight to a glass of wine which I consider to be an acceptable swap-out. I grabbed a tasty citrus pastry but there were small choices that kept me from being able to take anything else on the menu (nuts in the brownies for example). Although my food and beverage were alright (considering $16+tax between the two), the service left too much to be desired.Our table was not cleared of dishes until (what I can only assume was) long after we were gone. My biggest beef? Two well-off women go to pay and get the all-star treatment, yet I was not offered so much as a "hello", "how was your ______" or any words for that matter, just told "23.80, by card?".Ex-effing-scuse me? You were so lazy and uncaring about the service you offered that you didn't even see if I wanted the bill to be split? ZERO service throughout the hour that we were there and I will certainly not be back. Apparently it's a great pastry school, so I would suggest you grab summer treats for TAKE OUT.
If I die and go to pastry heaven this will be it. We shared the paris breast eclair and the passion fruit and raspberry tart. Both amazingly light yet memorable. I could sit here all day and eat everything they make.
Coffee was very very good, but the hazelnut pastry was the best ever. Service was great, we waited 15 min for a table but well worth the wait!!!
After spending the majority of my Montreal trip in Le Plateau and other small surrounding hoods, I decided to venture into the more touristy area of Old Montreal to take in the sights. We started in the main downtown area walking along and decided to swing by Notre Dame on our way to the old port. In need of a coffee that wasn't from Starbucks we found this cafe.When we first walked in, there was a cluster of tourists jamming up the works. I don't know why but they were taking pictures of everything they could find and letting nobody through. This was a red flag, but we marched on. With the confusion it was tough to figure out if we were to go through the line or sit at a table. We found out we could sit but then it was almost ten minutes before anyone came to serve us. We could have just finished waiting in line at that point.Aside from the chaos on the way in, everything else was amazing. I had an amazing chocolate pot de creme and an americano. I would have stuck around for some macaroons, but everything was just taking too long and we needed to get moving. Pro Tip: The bathroom is up the elevator on the 4th floor.
The best pastries I've ever had in my life. They bring out a full tray of perfectly sized pastries from which you can choose from, ranging from fruity to chocolatey. The environment is very small but beautiful. There is a colorful classic mural on the entrance, the service is impeccable, and the taste of the pastries are complex. The tea, coffee, and the iced tea are amazing as well, served in illy ceramic cups and detailed glasses respectively. Great experience.
Delicious pastries, especially the passion fruit raspberry tart. I really recommend it. Hot chocolate was the best I've ever had. Worth the money. Although, the service was not the best. Very slow service, took a very long time to bring the menu, then the choices, and instructions weren't so clear on the way we were supposed to pay. Usually, in restaurants, they bring the check to you but here, we had to get up to pay. We waited maybe 20 minutes for the check only to find out we had to go to the counter. In these kinds of situations, waiters should be more clear because we don't like wasting time.
I actually wanna give them 1 star for being so unbelievably good yet not being in my hometown atlanta. I guess that isn't fair so a 5 star is due for their out of this world culinary dessert marvels.I'm not a dessert fanatic but this place can give a diabetic reason to forgo their sugar intake check. I can hardly recommend anything. We literally tried 6 items and each was just unique and great in its own. The building houses two floors of pastry school right on top of this beautiful restaurant.To make it even sweeter the staff is just very humble. It's better to go in between meal times as it can get super busy. We went in accidentally after lunch and were seated right away. Of course deciding which dessert to order was probably more difficult than learning to fly a plane. But just to throw out some recommendations the chocolate almond croissant is probably the best I've ever had. Of course don't even think about leaving without trying their raspberry tart. Don't know how they made it but it's cold like sorbet in the center yet the tart shell and cream on top blends the whole dessert so beautifully. They have a wide variety of food items too but unfortunately we could only savor their desserts and coffees. So which ever restaurant you dine at just remember to skip dessert and rush to this sweet heaven.
Right near the Notre-Dame Basilica by the water is this cute and chic little pastry shoppe & cafe. We had the most delightful lunch here! The salmon sandwich is the best thing here -- comes with a poached egg and perfect smoked salmon with dill on a buttered (or mayoed?) bun. Their lobster & crab sandwich was good too, but I felt like the salmon was more satisfying. They show you a dessert tray for you to choose -- I chose a passion fruit & raspberry tart which was delicious. Also got a box of macarons to go! LOVED the lighting in this cafe and the simple decor. Huge ceiling-to-floor windows. Perfect for instagramming. Note: - Bathroom is on the 4th floor. - You pay at the front (even if you are dining in). - Macarons come in box of 6 or 12
This is my favourite pastry shop in Montreal without doubt! Their hazelnut eclair is my favourite. I make sure I stop by at this pastry shop every time I'm in old Montreal. Also, they have pastry school! Maybe coming here with loved one to make a cake would be a super good idea!
Fanciful pastry shoppe: -ghost chairs strewn throughout-gorgeous sugar display pieces-illy coffee -packaged marshmallows and sweets -gelato in the case-the flakiest, lightest croissant ever, must order!!!Brunch specials in the AM.  Limited savory menu starts at 11am.  If you like almond croissants, get there early, they were sold out at 10am today.  Tidbits: skip the Madeline.  Dry.  Bathrooms on the 4th floor.  The maple pastry is the second least sweet pastry next to the plain croissant.
This is definitely of one the best patisseries in the city, which perhaps then makes it one of the best patisseries in North America! Everything that is produced here is both exquisitely beautiful and mouthwateringly tasty.Christian Faure is no ordinary pastry chef he is a MOF (Meilleur Ouvrier de France) which means that he has studied and been tested at the highest levels in the world for his pastry making abilities. I can't even begin to describe in a manner that would do it justice what it takes to earn the title of a MOF. Luckily, there is a terrific documentary on Netflix called Kings of Pastry which does a great job. after watching this film you will have an even greater level of appreciation of what goes into the pastries from Maison Christian Faure. We are lucky to have access to such wonderful works of art for our tummies.
We simply ordered the classic croissants, well, because we're always looking for the best classics.  Absolutely found them!  Large, beautiful golden color, crispy outside, buttery inside (but not slick), perfect with jam.All the pastries and cakes were works of art, clearly made by pros (our diet won't let us splurge but you should!)
If you want an authentic French pastry and Illy coffee, come here!!! This place is fantastic!!!The restaurant is owned by a chef who was named the best pastry chef in the world. You will soon find it why! I had the chocolate almond croissant. It was the best croissant I have ever had!My husband had the chocolate croissant and it was flaky, yummy, perfection.There is really not a bad thing in this place!
Cute place for brunch or a treat from the bakery -- You get into line and as you get closer to the cashier, you'll be asked if you're eating in. If take out, you stay in line. If eating in, the server will clear a table for you and bring you menus with the sandwich/salad options (not sure if you can order those items for take out, or only the pastries/bakery items). Our food:Brunch on the Plank: orange juice, croissant, eggs benedict on a choux pastry with smoked salmon, brioche "nanterre" with caramel sauce, mini fruit cup. The OJ was wonderful, definitely freshly squeezed. I didn't try the eggs benedict since the portion was so small - he said it was good, though the hollandaise sauce was different than the norm. The caramel sauce for the brioche was delicious and decadent. Fruit cup was mostly pineapple and melon.Crab/lobster salad on a choux pastry: amazing presentation and decent chunks of lobster meat evident, but the choux pastry itself didn't taste fresh. The croissant from the brunch on the plank was delicious enough that we ordered another - note that they are more soft/flaky than crispy.Lemonade: too tart for meTotal was $42 with taxes, before tip.
It is the best backery I've ever been! It has a great location in Old Montreal. Elegant French interior and friendly service. I got Eggs Benedict with salmon. it is he food of Kings, so tender and light with foam of bitten egg whites. .. omg. Almond croissant was undeliverable too. Very nice place for all ages.
Quite simply the best pastry shop I've ever been to.  It fulfills everything you imagine a pastry shop to be - the parts that should be crisp are crisp, the parts that are smooth are smooth and the parts that are fruity burst with flavor.  Perfect execution across the board, friendly service and a must-stop.  Montreal, or any city really, would do well to encourage more places like this to exist.
Stop whatever you are doing and come to this place right now. The food, the ambiance, the service was everything and more. Our food was not only delicious, but it's presentation was out of this world. Our waiter was the sweetest thing, always making sure we had everything we needed. We asked to meet with the chef and boy was he one of my favorite humans. He was selfless and humble about the work he does and even introduced us to the marketing director who took us on a tour of the small but ever so delightful school upstairs. I love them and we plan are going back for brunch. GO HERE NOW!
Not sure if I need to review this place since it's so popular already, but it's just that good that I feel the need to share how much I love about Maison CF.  Everything here from the beautiful and delicate desserts to the savoury items are all prepared with love and dedication.  Just because it's a salad, doesn't mean it shouldn't be pretty.  And not only the presentation is beyond perfect, the food itself is also amazing.  I usually don't go there for the desserts (I know, silly me), but I go there for the brunch/lunch and pastries.  The $20 brunch menu was worth every penny...with choice of any drink, pastry, a Benedict of your choice (ham or salmon) with the fresh toast on the side, fruit salad and caramel sauce.  TWe also went there on Christmas day for the special Christmas brunch. The salmon and beef baked in puff pastry were both divine, so was the potato gratin on the side and the green beans. The normal lunch menu... the lobster and crab puff pastry thing was beautiful, although I am not a big fan of their puff pastry itself, it seems dried and hard to eat, but the dish was pretty and still would order it just so I can take another picture :)  The club sandwich was the best I've ever had.  The execution from the perfectly toasted bread to everything inside was amazing.  They ran out of turkey that day, so I was lucky enough to substitute to the roast beef. It's not your regular deli roast beef thin slices...it's like prime rib slices and to die for.  Best sandwich I've ever had, even the potato chips on the side.  The execution of all the dishes were carefully thought of and they've done it beautifully.  The place is small, can be overwhelming at times if you're waiting for a table, not a lot of space to stand around while you have a bunch of people coming in to buy pastries/desserts to go.  But all the staff are friendly and even though it's a big tourist trap... I am happily to be trapped inside.  It's just too good.  And it's also great to see Monsieur Christian there most of the time either at the kitchen or talking to people at the counter.  Also a very nice man to take picture with!  Great job.
Hidden gem in old montreal, walking into this pastry joint was simply mouth-watering as you see the sweets on display that looked delicious, savory and colourful. The decor was very elegant and French. Felt very cozy and comfortable.Once seated, they bring you a plate of all their sweets for you to choose - all looking very delicious. My favourite was the hazelnut eclair -- tasted like a mouth full of Ferro Roche.
One of the best desert places. I had a chocolate cake dessert. It had a heavenly taste. It seems like it was so carefully crafted. I almost closed my eyes while having the cake because it was that good. The coffee though is nothing special.
A friend once brought me as a date to an arts and culture event, where I mentioned that it was too bad there was no macaroons on the dessert table. The following week, he introduced me to Maison Christian Faure.Good : The place bright, clean and you can tell that it has quality pastries. They had a variety of macaroon flavors, and lots of delicious viennoiseries and confiseries ! It is a great place to stop for desserts and tea or to catch up with friends or even on a date since it's not to loud inside. And best believe it, the macaroons are amazing and has since raised the bar. It's a interesting mix of cafe and pastry school and shop all in oneBad : The prices are a bit steep, but what can you expect from a renown pastry chef? Bottom Line: I will definitely be returning to this lovely spot if I am in the mood to spoil myself.
I'm not sure if it is because I came here an hour before they close, or their service is just terrible all the time. The guy did not bother explaining any of their desserts (even after I asked what each one was), as they seem to be more concerned with closing the place on time than selling the rest of their desserts. We chose one of the pistachio cakes and a mango gelato from the fridge. I have no idea what was in the pistachio cake since the guy didn't bother to tell me at all... if that wasn't bad enough, they didn't have any plastic knifes or folks. It took asking 3 different staff members and 5 good minutes of waiting around for them to get a couple of folks. ** oh and there are seating areas but apparently they won't let you sit there an hour before they close since they close that area first. As for the actual desserts, they were alright. The cake was mediocre at best and the gelato was way too sweet. Maybe I didn't try the right desserts, but will not be returning.
Really good and beautiful macarons and pastries, just ok coffee and food.
Food 5/5 decor 3/5 staff&service 3/5Great decor, had the chocolate croissant and the chocolatine, they were soooo good and fresh. Definetly intend on going there for brunch!!
Maison Christian Faure is, simply put, a gem!Located in the beautiful Old Town of Montreal across the street from the excellent Archaeological Museum this little pattiserie packs a huge punch! The restaurant/shop is very hip and stylish with a modern, bright atmosphere.  Apparently there is a baking school above the restaurant, with the production shop/kitchen downstairs.Every baked item we had here over two visits was amazing! I did the plain croissant twice because it may be the best that I have ever had, anywhere!  The first lunch I had here I enjoyed a lobster and crab salad in choux pastry...delicious! We did brunch here on our last day in Montreal (Saturday) and had the "benedict" - they offered either ham or smoked salmon.  Both were in choux pastry with a light foam on top in lieu of the normal hollandaise sauce (I had the ham and my wife had the salmon).  They were both a wonderful, light riff on the traditional beloved benedict!The joint also serves Illy coffee, which is generally a plus...they did great with cappucinos and with longhe espressos.The only gripe I have with the place was the service was a bit haphazard.  They would be very attentive, but then would just forget about you once the food was brought out...no more water refills, no checking to see if you wanted anything else, etc.  So, go for the food and live with the service...it isn't bad service, just less attentive than I would really like.On the whole though, I whole-heartedly recommend Maison Christian Faure to anyone looking for a good breakfast / lunch place in Montreal...we spent two meals on our foodie honeymoon in Quebec there, so I promise you that it is legit!
A little pricey but really great food. I had the lunch combo to include the meat pie, an eclair and a fantastic cup of coffee. My wife had the soufflé and a lemon tart that was also quite delicious.  Would go out of the way to pick up some baked goods next time.
Had brunch at this place and it was really great! Although there isn't a lot of choice for food, both meals we had were amazing and the presentation was really great!
I was briefly visiting Montreal and decided that a trip to a pastry shop was in order. This is a small spot, but it's easy to find and there are a lot of options. I popped in there 30 minutes before it closed and it was pretty much empty. The young woman working there was very helpful whenever I asked her what some of the desserts were. I ended up choosing 3 different desserts and a couple of macarons, I paid around $25 for that. I got all of those to go, and they provided a nice to go box for me to carry my goods. Every single thing that I got was delicious! The macarons were heavenly, I regretted not getting more of them. Overall if you have a sweet tooth and enjoy tasty treats you won't be disappointed!
Pros: Variety of delicious French pastries, Nice interior, Authentic Cons: Most of it is gone at the end of the day (obviously), -Ambiance- Located away from the main action in Old Port , it offers a nice breather from all those tourists. Very nice shop that gives you that clean&fresh feeling; the decor and the pastries together sets you up for a pleasant visit. Everything behind glass is usually good and this was no exception. The service is kind and attentive but also relax in a sense where they don't annoy you constantly while you're stuffing your face. For pastries and drinks prices range from 3-13$. For real food it would be more (but why would you even?). -Food- Pot de Fleur de Sel Caramel : Salted caramel mousse on top of a chocolate brownie/cake? inside a cute glass pot. For me it was a different taste than what I was used to: more authentic than previous salted caramel treats that I've tried. It was not very sweet and the brownie added texture and more flavours to the whole dessert.  It ended up being one of my favourites. Strawberry Cake: The tartness of the strawberry balanced out the sweetness of the other components creating a solid, delicious piece of cake. Pistachio cake with fruits: For me it was like a pistachio cake with fruit cake on top that worked WELL together. It was light and pleasant. Lemon Meringue : It was  too sweet for my tastes as there was a layer of white chocolate under the filling. Good surprise for some but not for me, as I am adamant about my dislike for white chocolate. In this case, I dealt with it because I had tea and it did cut the acidity of the lemon filing.  The pastry was a bit hard for spoon handling, but we all have fingers- suck it up. -Overall- A nice place to stop and relax in the Old Port to enjoy a coffee or tea accompanied by pretty&tasty desserts. Not mind-blowing but a must go!
Ditto to what Bryant N said...just go! Went here for a lunch work. What a cute little patissirie which also offers light lunch as well. The decor is all white against a cement statement wall which adds that extra je ne said quoi to the already fancy decor.Your eyes will be hungry as soon as you walk in the door; gorgeous pastries all made in house (Chef Christian was there and happily obliging to photos with his fans :); I opted for Lobster and Crab puff pastry sandwich (it sounds much more fancy en Francais but I can't remember the name). Amazing. Whole lobster claw and crab meat in what seemed like a round croissant.Even if you don't save some room for dessert you will make room once you see the dessert tray....sensory overload! I ordered a coffee crumble cake with lemon mousse and meringue. Totally worth the workout that came afterwards. Merci beaucoup, Chef Christian!
soooooooo good. I tried several different ones, tarts, eclairs. They are all delicate.
When we walked it, I said, "Is this the place?" And someone walking out said, "This is the place."It was DEFINITELY THE PLACE!Lunch: Quinoa salad and the beef sandwich. The beef sandwich was very good, but there are probably better things. The quinoa was EXCELLENT! Dessert: We had an enclair, which was good, but not the best ever. Then we had some white chocolate, lemon, crunchy thing with two sticks on top -- that was EXCELLENT! We also took home croissants and an elephant ear for breakfast the next morning.Coffee: This was excellent as well, but I didn't realize it was $4 a cup. Over all our bill was $85 (including the tip), which is a little high for lunch, but we did have some take home goodies.
My family and I came here on our last morning in Montreal and I am so glad we did. The cafe is incredibly adorable inside; very bright and welcoming. They serve incredible pastries for the morning: croissants, chocolate croissants, croissants with chocolate on the outside, almond croissants, along with an array of others. Each one was better than the next, and believe I know because we had to try them all! The coffee was quite good as well. My husband ordered hot chocolate and it was some of the best i've ever had. It was rich in flavor, creamy, thick, and delicious. I absolutely loved this place. They had an array of delectable looking desserts as well. I wish I had found it earlier in the trip so we could have gotten some of those too!
Best croissant ever had!! Nice decoration inside and various kinds of pastries provided~ Canele I had that day seemed baked not very well but another unknown dessert (called tigre? I don't know french, sorry) was divine!! Felt pity that I haven't try their Napoleon and macaroon.
This" Magic Christian "Faure puts out some of the mostelegant and artfully crafted patisserie to be foundanywhere on the planet. He does it in his own Maisonthat is both sophisticated and unpretentious. So if you would like to experience fine dining in a pretty and cool bakery cafe setting this is the place to go.Our lunch here was fun, flavorful,and filling.We ordered the plat du jour special which includes  cafe and your choice of one of the marvelous looking and tasting pastries. We chose the smoked salmonClub sandwich which was served triple decker on thick slices of toasted Maison baked white bread, crusts removed. The smoked salmon layer was slathered in Christian's Mayonaise Maison and the upper layersurprised with a lightly fried egg ,lettuce and tomato.The sammich was accompanied by nicely done house potato chips and a small but tasty salad.For the pastry course our server came by with a tray of these most beautiful choices. It doesn't matter which One you choose. Your not going to find better.Chocolate hazelnut ganache..boom. Mille-Feuilles ;this is how we do!  BTW Christian Faure runs a pastryMaking school on the premises.So if you want the quality of having a lunch in a top French hotel restaurant or in a Boulud type place with out the stuffiness or the great expense this is it.It can get busy and service a little spotty but understandable given the attention to detail paid to the offerings here.
Maison Christian Faure was recommended to us by the Omni concierge. He said it was a classical french pastry shop with an atelier on the second floor -- obviously, we had to check it out.The Illy coffee we had here was the best I had in my entire trip. The croissant was quite good, but I'm more used to a crusty croissant with a soft interior. This croissant was soft everywhere. Additionally, I ordered the quinoa salad; it was tasty and the vegetables were very fresh, but it was overly sweet.This place is a very cute place to hang out and get a pastry and some coffee, but I wouldn't order a meal here again.
The restaurant looks promising when you walk in - the decor is fresh and the pastries smell good. I got the "brunch on a plank" and was really not impressed. It came with french toast that was not even warm and the eggs benedict came on a dry flavourless puff pastry instead of the standard english muffin. The eggs were also served with some sort of bechemel foam - moving away from the traditional creamy sauce but probably not with good reason. The saving grace of the dish was the fresh fruit and caramel sauce that came with it. I had been here before and was quite happy with what I had ordered by the brunch the second time was really average. Maybe it was an off day with the kitchen the second time I went in. Maybe I'll give them a 3rd shot - the seating in charming and it's in a lovely part of the city. Not sure yet though!
It says the coffee is ILLY. I feel It's not as good as these in ILLY store. For desserts, I like the pot caramel fleur de sel. Taste really good and not that sweet. The tarte passion framboise is too sweet for me and the pastry cup is not crispy enough.
Absolutely incredible French pastries and desserts. They look like edible works of art. Very beautiful cafe and friendly service. It's a little pricey but well worth it. Treat yourself and go here!
Quick summary: Just go .. Its that goodI was in a mood for some pastry and had happen to stumble into here. It was so good that my wife order two boxes full of dessert for my family. And then on my final day in Montreal we order additional pastries for travel. We are now actively looking for a place comparable to this place in our local area. It is one of those places that makes you realize how some desserts can be delectable and why some people specialize in just making these desserts.  Enough reading and start walking to this place.
Wonderful lunch place!! Highly recommend the traditional chicken club sandwich - comes with a generous side of chips. It was the best cold sandwich I've ever had.  The macarons are delicious as well.  I got mango-passion fruit, salted caramel, and praline - all were delicious.Service was friendly, and there was a slight lunchtime wait (because the restaurant's seating area is so small), but the staff turned tables over pretty quickly.  The staff here truly pay attention to detail and are so meticulous and careful in the arrangement of their pastry case.  I wish I got extra pastries and macarons to go!
Very good palace to have cup cake macaroon jilato and lionodas chocolaté(belgiem)Try inside metro lounguiel
I have only gotten pastries for take out but they never disappoint! Everything is so good and definitely some of the best classic French pastries in the city!
Delicious and the staff was so friendly! Great place to get a cafe and something sweet after a long day of discovering the city!
While on a family trip through Old Montreal, my aunt, a long-time resident in Quebec, steered my family and I toward this cute little French patisserie tucked away nearby a number of tourist staples and local bars. As a huge fan of French pastries, I guess you could say I was more than thrilled to rest my weary feet and enjoy a nice cafe au lait.The atmosphere of the cafe is modern-day yet traditional: the entrance features a colorful mural and the interior with its exposed brick wall, was accented with white decor and metal tables. Our server brought us that afternoon's available treats on a large silver platter, of which we chose to sample the eclairs, a chocolate mousse cake, and a white chocolate and pistachio cake. I also decided to sample a cappuccino (though to be fair, I really just wanted to see what art they'd put on top, which ended up actually being a little disappointing).The cappuccino was the perfect balance of bitter and sweet; overall, it was a good balance of the robust coffee flavor and wasn't too cloying. All of our sweets, were, however, a bit sweeter than I traditionally prefer. However, they were all executed incredibly well and had great textures and flavors, nothing short of what I expected from a restaurant owned by the best pastry chef in the world.We picked up a number of croissants for road, which turned out to be incredibly flaky, buttery, and still were fantastic (not even soggy, yes!) a few days later. It was certainly one of this pastry shop's most redeeming treats.Overall, Maison Christian Faure certainly met my expectations. While I may not have the biggest sweet tooth, I hope to return someday to take one of its many cooking and baking classes to make my own renditions of their famous treats.
There's not much I can say that hasn't been said here already.  Found this place through Yelp and visited.  Was everything that I hoped for.   I've been a few times now and when I go to Montreal, I try to return.  If there's one thing I think that would improve this place, it would be the service.  It seems a bit unorganized and occasionally somewhat slow, but the pastry is worth any downside on service.
Definitely a place to visit in Montreal. Casual atmosphere. A little bit on the pricey side, but the food is worth the money.
Amazing! Service was outstanding. Pastry was perfect - we had the almond croissants and macaroons. Coffee was also very good. Cafe is small but comfortable with great light. Nicely located in old Montreal and a great place to stop for breakfast, lunch or snack. Will definitely make this a planned stop next time I am in town.
Quaint bakery/restaurant in Old Montreal. My wife and I shared the Club sandwich, and it was good. My wife had a chocolate croissant, and I had the Brioche topped with crystallized sugar with a side of jam. You could see the Chef (Faure) teaching one of the students in the back and helping prepare some of the items being sent out. Their desserts look spectacular and so meticulously well prepared.
Walked in. No one acknowledged us, asked for a table (in English) - lady looked at me and walked away. Got ignored for another 5 minutes, walked out...
This place is pretty awesome, a bit expensive but worth it. Accidentally spent $50 by ordering 2 of every flavor of macaroon haha but well worth it.
Delicious chocolate croissant and passion tart.  Very nice breakfast spot. Lots of pastries, desserts and coffee to pick from.
On our last morning in Montreal, we were directed to this fantastic bakery.The space is beautiful; the food is fantastic; and the service is...friendly enough. If they lacked in any category at all, I'd say we didn't feel exceptionally welcome. Maybe that was because we came after the morning rush, and were sort of asking to be an afterthought.The royal breakfast was very tasty, though I think we'd been hoping for them to have something a bit more fortifying. If you're looking for sweet, though, this is it.I have to say, I was a bit rude. Though I'm usually more conscious of such things,  I murmured to my wife on the way out that $7 (USD) for a small bag of marshmallows seemed a bit much. I should have waited 10 more seconds until we were outside. Apparently, one of the staff overheard me, and (probably a bit offended) reminded us that they were homemade. I wasn't talking to you, but, you're right. They are homemade. And they were delicious. They barely made it back to Boston. Touche.
We had an event here, the place has a shop on the ground level, a school on 2 and 3, finally floor 4 is used for events. The event space is not what I'd call "nice", and the service was quite slow. The coffee wasn't very good for the event. The French pastries however were absolutely amazing, probably the best I have had outside of France.
Only managed to get a passion fruit raspberry tart there and it was so yummy!!  Beautifully presented,  betters crust with well balanced tartness of passion fruit mousse on top of sweet raspberry filling.  Got there too late for the almond croissant that other people raved about.  Definitely will come back again if I am in Montreal.
Charming French bakery in Old Montreal. Beautiful arrangement of pastries. The croissant was a bit too sweet and overcooked for my liking. However, the desert fruit/ citrus tarte was incredible. Kind of pricey, but the quality of the desert stuff is very good. Good service.
If there is one thing the French can do well is cook and certainly the French excel in baking.  After yelping around for a good place to pick up a pastry and a coffee, I found Maison Christian Faure.  With the credentials of this place, I had pretty high expectations.  We walked in shortly after they had opened and the poor girl was running the place by herself.  She was trying to prep for the day, lay out the pastries, and serve a number of guests already seated.  Besides the bumpy start, the pastries here could be smelt a few blocks away, and they looked even more beautiful.  I ordered an almond croissant and it was.....easily one of the best almond croissants I've had.  Their madeline cookie that came with our coffee was equally delicious.All the baking is done on premises (upstairs) and this is also a baking school.  If you're visiting Old Montreal, you NEED to come here and try some of their baked goods.  The only regret I had was not ordering more items, next time, there's always next time.
LOVE!!!I make sure to stop here when I'm in Montreal. Love their club sandwich and make sure to take some pastries to go. The service is a wee bit slow when you're seated to eat-in but that doesn't take away from the amazing, fresh food they have. Love this place. I am a big fan.
Best Lemon meringue of my life, quiche is divine. This is the best desert place I have experienced, PERIOD!
Stopped by here twice -- first during a food tour of the city and snatched up a dozen of their macaroons which were juicer than normal ones I've had. They came in at least a dozen flavors and I got one of eachCame back later for an early dinner and while I was starving their menu was misleading since they only had one menu item to select from. I take a star for that since why do you even offer me a menu then...?Their dish was a bagel topped with lox and an egg prepared beautifully. On the side was fresh fruit, French toast and a container of salted caramel to dip it in. Also included a bakery item where we picked a chocolate croissant that was perfect baked!
This is definitely a destination you must visit in Montreal, we tried a little bit of everything and it was all amazing! My favorite was the macarons (in TONS of awesome colors and flavors), and the Chocolate Almond Croissant. We also took a bag of homemade marshmallows to go, which were very very good. The maple ones we got were a tad too sweet for my taste, so i'd probably just get the vanilla if i got more. Cant wait to be back in montreal so we can go here again!
Loved it , service was very friendly, they come to ask if everything is satisfying your need or not. And the food were delicious. Had the lemon meringue while my friend had the fruit tart (stole some of her portion). They were fresh since they were just made, flavor was very rich and smooth. Would come again to try other desserts.
This patisserie was delicious with fresh OJ and nice croissants and Madeleine with jam. The apple turnover was very soft and crunchy but the Madeleine was a bit hard.. The raspberry tart was quite good but very sweet, a nice morning in a beautiful place though!
I really enjoyed this place . It looked almost closedThey have a pastry school upstairs YOU WILL LOVE IT
If you are ever lost, make sure it is in Old Montreal, on a warm winter's day on the way to this pastry shop. As we walked past beautiful shops and unique restaurants, we definitely built up an appetite for the tasty, well-baked offerings at this wonderful shop. Mid-afternoon, the elegant shop was full of friends catching up with each other, couples having a leisurely lunch, and tourists taking a well-deserved pause in their wanderings. I loved the large window overlooking the area, the fairly large tables, and transparent acrylic chairs. On each table, a colorful bird perched on a small silver tree - cute! While we waited for the pastry tray, I scoped out a beautiful smoked salmon salad and a delicious-looking lobster salad sandwich (on a brioche bun). We will need to better plan our meals next time around - both of us were just in the mood for dessert today. Given that we burned off a ton of calories while we were lost, we both got two desserts! At least that's the story that we're sticking to.There were several interesting offerings: a Paris-Brest éclair with hazelnut cream; a wedge of flan, and a passion fruit/raspberry tarte. I went with both the mille-feuille and the canelé. The latter was okay: the crust was leathery as opposed to crusty while the interior was much better - a cross between custard and cake with a holely crumb. There was also definitely the heavenly fragrance of vanilla and rum.The mille-feuille was outstanding. The pastry was buttery and flaky, as it should be but rarely is, almost as if the pastry chef piped the pastry cream just upon ordering. I enjoyed every forkful of this wonderful dessert. I also got to sample the caramel fleur de sel pudding. It was subtly sweet and flavorful.The shop also sells quiches from their refrigerated case, as well as terrines and glacés. Shoppers can also find a selection of French macarons, jams, biscuits, marshmallows, and organic teas available for sale.
Mother of God...what can I say...best desserts I've ever had. The club sandwich was delightful as well.
Located just across from the Pointe-à-Callière Museum, it's a convenient spot to rest your feet or warm up during the winter while exploring Old Montreal. The pastries aren't too bad either.The main upper level is the cafe while the pastry school is on the lower level. As you enter, you'll be greeted walls of colorful tea tins and macaron models next to a large counter. The dining space is bright and clean, with minimalist furniture (wooden tables with metal tops, transparent plastic chairs) against a mosaic wall of slate-colored stones.We ordered the mille feuille (LOVED the cream), passion fruit tart with raspberries, apple galette, and something with nutella -- all were absolutely lovely! The illy coffees were nothing special, but good enough to pair with our desserts and help regain warmth in our fingers.Overall, it's a solid spot with decent pastries and passable coffee, and you won't regret stopping here! Heard they also serve brunch as well!Notes:- Credit cards are accepted!
Mmmmmm excellent dessertsWe were there at a nice Montreal evening by their closing time. We were the last two persons there and as I find it so calm I decided to fine myself by not have any of the desserts. I just wanted a live ambience that I can sit, relax and enjoy our time. I was heading out when I decided to go to washroom. So asked the lady behind the counter and although it was their closing time she kindly told me to take the elevator to level 4 and i'll find washrooms on my right. I just figured out that the place is not just a french patisserie but also a pastry school, when I was in the elevator reading floors names. So I decided to grab a bite on my way back to the car and relax in the car as oppose to any place which is open and omg I had the nicest eclair in my life. A hazelnut eclair a taste of the heaven. For Sure when ever I'll back in Montreal this place is a must visit before 7 p.m.Thanks to the amazing team of pastry chefs
We really enjoyed our brunch here.  The pastries were excellent, the coffee was nice, and the atmosphere was pleasant.
Best pastry shop in the old Montreal stretch. Small intimate setting is good for a breakfast coffee date with your honey. Almond croissants and the brioches we're my favorites.  Other sweet treats are perfect for gifts. Didn't get a chance to try everything. Their hand crafted mashmellows were simply heavenly. Raspberry marshmallows. Delicious and light.
Absolutely amazing! There has never been a better place to sit and eat true French viennoiserie!  The almond croissant is phenomenal and the chocolatine devine!  A real find in the heart if Old Montreal.
This is one of the best patisseries I have ever seen. I could eat here every morning and have the best of everything. Staff is great and facilities clean and lighted. A must see to believe and taste.
Amazing pastries! Went here on a Sunday and had their brunch special along with some desserts. Eggs Benedict was well cooked and the French toast was delicious even without the syrup.Definitely try their eclairs. Very well done.
The food is good but I had a bad experience. I wanted an almond croissant. They were out so I ordered a plain. I got one (to go) and was mistakingly charged for two. I returned the next afternoon to point out the error. The manager was quick to offer a refund. I explained I would rather try their almond croissant and pay any additional charge. However they were all out. I said I would return the next morning. When I did they were all out of almond croissants even though it was just a few minutes after 10:00. Three times I tried and three times they were sold out before 10:00. Why not make more? They offered to refund the mistaken charge (2.50) but I said I'd take a plain croissant instead. Three trips to the shop and I didn't get to try an almond croissant. I am grateful that they made up for their mistake at the cash register. My rating reflects my experience, not their food, which is better than the rating
Really excellent brunch/lunch/desserts and coffee/tea. Service is also really friendly and fun. Lots and lots of great options. Easy to carry packaging if you're ordering to go. The place opened in 2013, and we've been returning every year when we visit Montreal. Highly recommended!!!
The pastries are out of this world good and have a very simple yet creative brunch menu. Nicely designed and located on a quiet street in Old Montreal.
Outstanding lunch options with solid pastriesAmbience/Service:  This restaurant is adorable, with a trendy, modern display case of beautiful macarons and pastries as you enter and a small area for seating next to an old stone wall and sun pouring through the front windows.  Everyone in the store was extremely helpful and service was outstanding.Food:  We originally came for the pastries but ended up being intrigued by their lunch options.  I'm vegetarian and got the fresh goat cheese and beet puff pastry.  My girlfriend got a seared scallop puff pastry.  These took a bit of time to prepare but our lovely waitress told us so and said they were going to bring us an amuse bouche to tie us over, which was a house-made pate (a pretty popular dish in Montreal) with a small amount of pie(?) crust on its outside.  My girlfriend really enjoyed it.  As we waited, I saw what seemed to be a gorgeous macaron plate being assembled back in the kitchen.  I distinctly told my girlfriend - man, I wish I was getting that plate.  It turns out it was my goat cheese and beet puff pastry with a savory macaron in it.  It was arguably the most beautiful plate of food I've had in my life.  It tasted just as good as it looked.  Subtle goat cheese.  Perfectly roasted beets.  Perfectly cooked puff pastry.  Asparagus, dill.  Just beautifully balanced.  My girlfriend said her scallops were seared to perfection, seasoned well, and was delicious as well.  We also got a Paris-Brest eclair and another pastry recommended by our waitress (a vanilla/rum baked good, don't remember the name).  It was well executed but far too strong a taste for me.  Cappucino and latte rounded out the meal.  It was not cheap but it was absolutely worth it.*UPDATE: we came back (I couldn't resist) and got a lemon tart and an almond croissant.  I'm surprised to say that we didn't really enjoy the pastries. The almond croissant had a similarly alcoholic flavor to it which I did not want in the morning.  The lemon tart was a touch too lemon-y.  I still think this place is 5 stars for the lunch options.Overall:  I wanted to come back to this restaurant every morning but resisted the urge to try other places.  I think I would have enjoyed eating here every day we were in Montreal.  DO NOT pass up this place when in Montreal.
Amazing, amazing, amazing.  We visited today and had  couplr macaroons(2.5 each), chocolate croissant, and a fancy pastry ($6, maybe caramel?). We did sit inside, but you can take ut to go also. On the 3rd floor you will find students making these delicious treats. So good!
Being a macaron snob and this is probably the only time I will ever use the word snob when it comes to food, I definitely have my favorites and have traveled wide and far (ok, fine -- furthest is LA) to seek out the best. So I like to say I have some experience when knowing which macaron place has the best. So far, Toute de Sweet near me in Bethesda and Laduree have been on the top for me. I like to compare this place a bit like Laduree but on a smaller scale. When walking in, it definitely had that Parisian cutesy decor and all the patisseries were too cute. However, the macaron selections did look a bit lacking and we only had a few to choose from. I grabbed a box of 15 and hit the road for our long drive back to MD. I didn't try these until later that night and although they were good, it lacked that chewy factor.  But, the next day, I tried them again and the chewy factor came into play, which reminded me of Laduree a bit. Macarons done right should be eaten within few days in the fridge because the shell will crack when bitten into. You can also let it thaw a bit from the cold before eating, but really, who has time for that. This place was pretty pricey considering the lack of selections so I definitely would prefer Laduree over this place. But hey, if you're in old Montreal, feel free to stop by and give it a try. Had we known that this place served food as well, we would've loved to try it for brunch.
Terrific option for brunch, and an outstanding source for French pastry. There's a counter in front, loaded with every sweet treat of your dreams, plus a grab-and-go case filled with sandwiches, drinks, fruit, etc. The seating area was filled with tourists, but plenty of locals wandered in for a to-go croissant and coffee.Brunch is a casual affair, but both the quality and service are perfect, which is surprising for the most maligned meal of the week. Our waiter, in particular, was a model of good humor and professionalism. [Of course, we had to return for a dozen macarons on our way to the airport. Forget the T-shirts; THIS is the souvenir your friends are waiting for.]The chic interior is sophisticated but relaxed. There are stairs leading up from the street, so if you have a stroller or mobility issues, please take this into account.
The smell in this place is like heaven.  Someone should really bottled the smell of fresh pastries up and sell it as a air freshener.  I will be the first in line for that. The chocolate croissant here was the best i ever had.  Hard to describe but it was so much better than the one at Pillards in Quebec.   Another good item was the raspberry tart.  Very tangy but so good.  A little disappointed in the eclair.  People were saying on Yelp that it was a must try.  After taking several bites, it was nothing to really get excited about. They had lots of macaroons but they are not my thing.  So didn't really try it. Price wise, all French pastry seems to have prices very consistent.  They tend to be higher than most non French ones and this place was no exception. Will i come back... yes.  There were so many more items i wanted to try but was just too full to do it.
This place located in the heart of Old Montreal and right by the water. Very limited seating, however they turn the table in timely manner.They do have good pastries and decent coffee. They use illy for their beans.It's a good place for lunch and late afternoon tea/coffee time with desserts.
Excellent bakery and had THE most amazing quiche for lunch. The chocolate croissant and almond chocolate croissants were the best we had in the city. The cappuccino was very good also. We went on a Sunday around 11:30 and there was a pretty big line to get a table. It was a little confusing to know whether the line was for a table or take-out. It appeared to be for both, which was odd if you just wanted to get something to go. We wanted to sit, so it didn't impact us, but for people just wanting take-out, it might have been frustrating to have to stand in line so long. The service was friendly, although a bit slow as they only had what appeared to be one waiter for the whole area, with one other helping him out. But, if you have a few hours to spare and you want deliciously fresh food, don't miss this place.
best pastry chef in mtl we are lucky he decided to make this institution here in mtl and teach ppl about real pastry making for quebecers i always go back for the passion fruit tart TO DIE FOR
let's get this out of the way, if you're looking for coffee, don't bother. disappointing is mildly putting it and with the asking price, it's highway robbery considering its priced like 3rd wave coffee! my cappuccino had no flavor whatsoever and was quite cold/lukewarm.now, if you're looking for sweets, you're definitely in the right place. it's good, it's pretty, a bit pricey but it's worth to treat yourself here and there or to entertain people over.i have a soft spot for cannelé and éclairs. when they have those, that's what i'm always getting.the cannelé is crisp, a bit chewy and quite hard on the outside but soft and moist with a certain sweetness to it when you tear into it. that's really good stuff. while i like them fresh off the oven. cold is still pretty good.as for the éclair, i had a choice between chocolate or coffee. they were out of their famous paris brest éclair so i settled with chocolate since i got a cup of coffee, making a mocha flavor out of it was the obvious thing to do. the dark chocolate topping was lovely while the chocolate cream filling was on the sweeter side very reminiscent of milk chocolate ganache. it was good but could have been better if it was all dark chocolate. as for the choux pastry: golden brown, light, chewy. tender and oh so good.while what i got was pretty good, the coffee left a bad taste in my mouth and made the experience not what it's supposed to be.if you forego coffee, its a solid experience. if you take into account the coffee, it becomes so-so
This place serves delicious food! The almond croissant is to die for! I also had the eggs benedict brunch option which was great! The wait staff is friendly and speedy. I highly recommend this place! It is close to old town and the river which is also nice.
If there was a way to bottle sumptuous and opulent French patisserie, a down-to-earth and unpretentious cafe with a Parisian-like atmosphere, and a pastry-cooking school for the amateurs to the more serious, then Maison Christian Faure has made this dream possible in the elegant multi-floor temple of wordly treats located right in the historical heart of old Montreal.My pilgrimage started on a lazy Saturday morning with a frothy cafe au lait with the difficult task of choosing between the different types of exquisite viennoiseries including buttery croissants, different types of jams, dozens of fancy brioches, golden mini-madeleines, pain au chocolats and so many more. Thank goodness the lovely host, Chloé, was there to help me.The journey then continued with a (take out) sampling of perfectly executed pralined Paris Brest Eclairs (my favorite), decadent Milles-Feuilles, a classic Opera, and the colorful Raspberry and Passion Fruit Tartelette. There were so many other more to chose from but I had to show some restraint as quality does come with a price... no worries, I will certainly return with friends!In a culture where it is getting tougher to find the time to pause, take a seat, to  reconnect with each and other -- children, parents, friends, neighbors and ultimately ourselves, I strongly recommend you to take a break and treat yourself. This seems to just that perfect chic place for conversation, and escape from daily routines -you'll feel both fanciful and folksy all at the same time.
Great quality brunch. Albeit a bit pricey for what you get. If you stop in, i would suggest just getting the croissant and a coffee. The bakery is the first floor of christian faure pastry school. Our server was Christian Faure son. The service is slow but i think its because us american's are in and out.
didn't like the madelein, canele was just comme si comme ca
Phenomenal! Pure and simple. I fell in love with this artisan Montreal jewel a short while ago after tasting their chocolate cake. Piece of heaven! (Add a touch of Itzhak Perlman playing, and that would be heaven). I've also tried their macaroons. It's no Parisian Pierre Herme, but it's tasty. The staff are great. They try to make you enjoy your experience there, even when you speak little or no French. It's definitely a must-try. The world needs more tasty glimpses of heaven like this.
Go there.  That's my advice.  The pastries are out of this world...as is the coffee and the general ambiance.  Once we discovered this cute little pastry shop/cafe, we went back every chance we had.  I only had the Palmiers, but my friend tried a couple of different things.  She loved them all.
The macaroons here lack flavor though are beautiful but it's the almond croissant and other pastries that are a joy to behold. The staff are very kind and attentive and gave great service.
In NYC we are spoiled with several MoFs's pastry shops but no one comes close to Mr. Faure. He should really open up a shop in NYC. We had several pastries of which I will post photos but our favorite was the mille feuille.  Wow...custard heaven!  If you are in Old Montreal, this pastry shop is a must.  Try the pastry of the day, mille feuille or an eclair...you will thank me later.
The concierge at our hotel described this place as the best bakery in Montreal. She wasn't kidding. I will go home and dream longing about the chocolate eclair!
Amazing! I made sure to make the time to stop by this beautiful and charming shop, and I am so glad that I did. I got four different pastries- a caramel and dark chocolate tart, which was perfect- not too sweet, and beautiful; a lemon meringue tart, which was lovely; a cannele, which the friendly man who packaged up my treats helped to pronounce properly (my French is pretty much non-existent); and a delectable croissant. Then, as I was signing my receipt, the cashier suggested I take a sample of their marshmallows. I decided on the spot to buy a bag of the vanilla marshmallows, but he suggested I try the raspberry. Totally amazing! I whipped out my credit card right there and bought a bag. I wish I didn't live 4000 miles away, because I already want more!
So much fun to try all their pastries.  I would go there for treats daily if I lived in the area.  The hot chocolate is so rich.  Fabulous.
i had the best palmier here!  All their pastries are mouth-watering and i wish i tried one of each, but due to limited time, i was able to try their palmier, almond croissant and their macaroons.  The palmier was crispy, sweet and flaky - a super dance party in my mouth.  I wish i could have savored every moment and bite!  The almond croissant was pretty good too!  The filling is not as sweet at others I've tried (which is to my preference) and the flakiness of the croissant was perfect!  I wasn't a huge fan of their macaroons.  They are not bad, but also not out of the world.  If you come here, i would recommend trying all their pastries and elsewhere for macaroons.  I will come back when i visit montreal again! :)
My friends and I had lunch at MCF through a travel guidebook recommendation. And we were not disappointed. Croissant and Palmier were delightful. It is so hard to get good croissants back home in Singapore. When the server brought the tray of pastries to choose for dessert (I had the lunch special which included a choice of dessert with my entrée), OMG .. How could I choose only one?! Service staff was polite and friendly. So glad we found the place!
This place definitely deserves 5 stars. It's a great place to have a cup of latte and escape cold Montreal weather in October. Their eclairs are to die for and the quality of their cakes and pastries is superb. Just look at the pics and you'll understand what I'm talking about. Surely, you owe yourself a visit here after visiting Notre-Dame Basilica. Maison is a great place to unwind, have a cup of coffee or tea together with one of their amazing pastries or cakes.
Do not miss this gem and make sure you go early in your trip so you can return again and again! This is a classic French bakery with much to delight the senses.  The staff is more than happy to help you make a selection, either to go or to enjoy it he shop.  Get a nice cuppa and settle in to rest your tired toes and delight your senses.  I could make suggestions, but offerings change daily, and having been here repeatedly, I can confidently say that no. Matter what you choose, you will not be disappointed, in fact, you will be delighted.  And get some to go, you will be dreaming about their goods before you get home.
Great French pastry shop. The croissants are amazing and the desserts and macaroons to die! Highly recommend but not so cheap
White chocolate coffee pastry - tasted delicious and presented beautifully!! My husband enjoyed a perfect lemon meringue (real meringue) tarte.
Amazing pastries!!!! This place really does deserve a 5 star. The chef is absolutely down to earth and really cares about the qualify of the product. Although the customer service needs some improvement. Bon appetit!
I always walk in front of that bakery but never had a chance to stop as it is not very pet friendly..That being said, it is the BEST pastry in NORTH AMERICA.  Service, food, ambiance and payment was so simple all is missing is that little patio place on the side walk for dog walkers like me.  Maybe have some hooks outside with water to attract the locals in the morning!Merci.
I'm a dessert person. Will choose dessert over main course any time. I stopped by after lunch at Olive et Gourmando. The almond croissant here is flakier and richer than O&G (no comparison). I also had the maple brioche. However, my absolute favorite is chocolate croissant which is sold on weekends only. It's chocolate swirl around the croissant with a bar of chocolate inside...highly recommended.  Light, flaky, chocolaty and not too rich. Yum!
We were told if you do anything in Montreal, you have to have French pastries. After some careful research, we ended up at Maison Christian Faure. We were staying at the Governour's Hotel in Quartier Latin, and despite frigid temperatures, we decided to walk over to Old Port (about fifteen minutes or so). As noted by other reviews, MCF is tucked away on a side street and could be easily missed if you're not looking out for it.  When you enter, there are stairs leading up, and down. Down, I'm assuming, is the pastry school, whereas the dining area and pastry shop is upstairs. The pastry counter is the first thing you see when you walk up the stairs (macarons to be exact), and I'm pretty sure I began salivating right away, while planning my to-go pastry strategy.The space is very sleek with a bit of rustic charm, and bright and airy. We were seated by the window, and the angle of the sunlight made it hard for me to take pictures of my food. C'est la vie. We both got the brunch plank, which was the perfect amount of food. It started with a chocolate croissant each, layers of flakiness and bits of chocolate galore. Sadly, the croissants arrived before our espresso, and I could barely wait. Then, the plank came, with a cup of fresh fruit, a slice of brioche, a side of caramel sauce, and a delightful spin on eggs benedict (I got the salmon, my partner the ham). It was just enough to leave room for dessert. I got macarons to try later, and found them less than stellar but not detracting from my overall impression of MCF. I'll make this place a must-stop on subsequent trips to Montreal!
Everything in the bakery looked delicious!  I picked up a passion fruit raspberry tart and 2 macarons - pistachio and passion fruit mango.  The macarons were overpriced at $2.50 each, but the tart was good and reasonably priced at $4.50.
If you want traditional French pastries this place is as good as it gets. We went to Maison Christian Faure for breakfast on a Saturday morning. The atmosphere was pleasant and the service very professional. The almond croissant was as good as any pastry I've ever had. Soft almond paste center, crispy, flaky crust outside. Coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice rounded out the meal and we left satisfied and wishing we didn't have to leave Montreal.
A cute chic cafe in the heart of Old Montreal right off of Rue Saint Paul perfect for afternoon tea or a lunch date.  The desserts are beautiful and aren't too sweet.  The decor is modern, feminine, and charming.  There were lots of locals including ladies who lunch, chic yuppies, and romantic couples.  We tried the pistachio cake and the berry galette with an iced cappuccino.  Both were delicious!  They also serve lunch here if you're looking for something more substantial.
Location: Tucked away in the old port, just off St. Paul.Space: You can tell that great care was taken in the design and decor of this space because it's absolutely stunning. When you walk in, you'll notice a beautiful mural depicting the days of Montreal past. Similarly, there is another mural located inside the shop. Yes, the place is mostly white and may come across as sterile to some, however, all that white is contrasted with beautiful pops of color that peek out from behind the displays... Displays that are filled with lovely, perfectly crafted pastries and sweets that you would be a fool not to try. Not to mention the awesome stone wall (that may or may not be original) and hardwood floors. The space is incredible - I'm thinking they should let me live there. In terms of seating, there are only a handful of tables, but these are well spaced out so you don't need to share your dessert with your neighbors. You all know how I feel about personal space! Stuff: You saw my pictures. If you didn't, then go look at them and you'll immediately understand why I fell in love with this place. The Maison C-F offers fresh pastries that are so pretty, you'll feel bad cutting into them with that fancy spork they give you. They also make macarons, cakes, baked goods, and they have a refrigerated section where you can purchase pre-made cakes. I'm not sure if they're ice cream cakes so you can go check that out for yourself.  I ordered an Americano and it was served just the way I like it, using Illy coffee. My dessert of choice was the chocolate eclair. It was positively divine - delectable - deliriously delicious. I have never been served an eclair that was so.... stuffed - and the filling was chocolate! YUM! They're not cheap, that's for sure. The eclair was amazing and I could tell the patissier uses quality ingredients simply by its taste and texture. That said, it WAS a bit rich, which is why I begrudgingly left a little piece behind. I just couldn't eat anymore despite my best efforts. My date had the pot au caramel and loved it. Service: This is why I rated this 4 stars instead of 5. No one greeted us when we walked in. We stood at the counter for a minute because we weren't sure if we should be waiting for someone to seat us or if it was OK to pick our own table. Even then, no one greeted us. We then sat at our table for a few minutes while boy-waiters walked by and looked at us, but still offered no greeting. HELLO are you BLIND? For a minute, I thought we'd entered into a new restaurant trend - where the wait staff is both blind mute. When we finally did get service, our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable, so that made up for the initial failure to launch.  BUT you should still greet your clients when they walk through the door.  On a related note, M. Faure was out and about on the floor chitchatting with clients as well as greeting those that walked through the door. We ran into him in the elevator and he was very friendly. It's great to see a business owner taking the time to interact with their clientele - it definitely encourages repeat visits!So.... you have to go. Get off your couch, brave this crazy-ass Montreal polar vortex and go feast on Christian Faure's pastries. Don't worry - you'll leave there a little plumper so you won't feel the cold as much =-D
Oh my!! What can we say, from the impeccable service to the outstanding pastries we LOVED this place. It's definitely on our list of places to return to in Montreal.
This was one of the highlights of a recent trip to Montreal.  Everything, from breakfast pastries, to the desserts and coffee was fantastic.  The service was excellent and I had one of the best almond croissants I have ever eaten.
What a wonderful place! Clean and bright.  The pastry display left me wide eyed in wonder. I had a fabulous hazelnut eclair.   The espresso was a delight. Will come back.
If I could give this 10 stars, I would in a heartbeat. Except I can only give 5 :( I'm not usually a brunch girl, but this place got me head over heels. Service was slightly MIA at times, but nothing to fret over. The salmon was fishier than what I'm used to, but it balanced out the fruit, french toast, and danish. Omg their pastries....bring back one of each if you can. The apple tart and croissant was absolutely amazing. At one point, the server asked us if we could move our table slightly to make room for others, and then five min later...he came back with a whole dish of colorful beautiful macarons to make up for the "inconvenience." My family and I were floored...like this is amazing. I don't even usually like macarons, but they managed to change my mind about them here. Cutest tea bins ever. We came back a second day to order more stuff to go this time, only sad part is that they forgot to include the hazelnut chocolate eclair in our order :(( Most adorable shop ever...definite must try.
Looking for an early lunch/late breakfast and found this place using Yelp.  It was wonderful.  Not only are the pastries out of this world, but the lunch was excellent.  I got the chicken club, based on another review I read and it was great.  Good spot to grab a nice lunch and probably the best pastries in Montreal.
Beyond amazing! Perfectly executed flavors & presentation. World reknown pastry chef earned his stripes for sure! Best French pastries I have ever tasted...in the world. No lie. Good prices for what you get too. Crisp modern decor. Can't say enough about how good it is.
Was wondering in Old Montreal an afternoon looking for a place to buy some croissant. They seated us nevertheless and offered a large selection of pastries. They are just so-so in my opinion.
They are inconsistent here and overpriced for the lack of quality.I bought an eclair the first time around and it was good.  I went back for another eclair and it was OLD. It was small, there was practically no cream inside, it was dry.. really, seriously a waste of $6.If you want a decent eclair that doesn't look too fancy, go to Complexe Desjardins, find the O Gateries / La Belge Bakery there, and buy those eclairs for $4.05 They're worth it.Only the tarts are decent, but DO NOT take the lemon meringue tart. I paid a lot of money for it and it ended up being totally, utterly, disgusting. I am not a fan of cream to begin with, but then the lemon curd inside was.. just.. effing weird. Like eating dish soap. Sweet dish soap.I tossed it in the garbage. Took a few bites, regretted the money I spent and .. oof, into the garbage.I also tried the strawberry cake (fraisier) and found it OK, but the cream on top ruined it for me. The cake was also soaked in sugary syrup and in general was too sweet for my personal tastes but not bad.
This place is great!! I don't know why there isn't a long line out the door!!! Beautiful building, gorgeous desserts, amazing brunch, friendly staff, and great drinks!
The best chocolate-almond croissant! Wonderful people and service!! I thoroughly enjoyed. Wish I could be more there were so many wonderful pastries and desserts
This is a gorgeous contemporary space in the historic Old Montreal area. As you head up a flight of stairs and round the corner, the pastry case of treats comes into full view! We were there for a breakfast snack at around 10 am on a weekday and the case was full so we had the full selection available to choose from. We selected the blueberry tart and an almond croissant. Both were good. My favorite part of breakfast? My terrific cup of very hot, dark, boldly flavored coffee. It was the perfect foil for the richness of the croissant. On the way out, I purchased a few more items to try later including an apple pastry -- that was apparently a shocking $12! My other half ate the whole thing so I'm not sure why it cost 3x as much as my croissant but it was reportedly tasty. There are no prices on the pastries so I suppose you should ask if you don't want any surprises sprung on a stupid non-French speaking tourist like me.  :(One other tip: there's a menu of breakfast options posted English discretely on one of the walls. It seems that there is some sort of set breakfast that includes juice,  coffee, and pastry -- Unfortunately,  I only saw this as we were leaving. Next time perhaps!
makes me feel like a lady when I walk in here. pricey but when you're here it makes you feel like you can swipe (with a credit card) and not think about budgeting. recommended by the pastry chefs themselves: passion fruit tart & chocolate eclairloved their caneles
Excellent pain au chocolat. I wish we had stayed and done brunch. The whole case looked amazing. The hot chocolate was not great and the espresso was just ok. I would definitely come back here for food, would probably go for the tea options instead of the other drinks.
not bad but the they didn't have the one pastry I wanted. this made me sad and I was irritated that I walked the treacherous icy terrain of Montreal to get there.
Delicious cake !Fantastic! Vey good experience, I will be back. Btw: I like ice wine which recommend by waiter.
I just have to say that Yelp in Montreal never lead us wrong.This bakery was no exception.  It's in a touristy area, with some expensive hotels and restaurants.  I had a three different croissant-like pastries over two days, as well as a few slices of a loaf of bread.  It was all incredible.  I also brought home a bag of home-made marshmallows.  The guy behind the counter said they are the best in Montreal.....after eating 4 in one sitting, he's probably not lying.They have some tables so you can sit down to enjoy your pastries and coffee.
Went on a recommendation.  Three tables occupied, no line at the counter, two servers.  We waited at the counter for service.  And waited...  One server asked if we wanted something to go, then disappeared.  Second server couldn't be bothered.  No 'bonjour', no 'hello'.  And we waited some more.  We left...
I tried the flan and strawberry shortcake.  Both were phenomenal and beautifully constructed.
Our family stopped by this bustling bakery on a hot August afternoon. We got the most delicious baked goods. The croissant was buttery and flaky. The almond crossoint was filled with soft almond paste. The chocolate croissant possibly the best ever. My cafe latte was smooth and creamy. The best patisserie of our trip!
We got brunch plank and Americanos at this cafe and with my sweet tooth, I had to buy some macarons for the drive back. Everything tasted great and service was superb. There's a pasty/cooking school upstairs so you know the food was made on-site. Recommend this while you're in old montreal.
You walk in to an overload of amazing looking pastries. How does one decide what they want to eat! All look delish! We sat for the breakfast eggs Benedict that came with smoked salmon, brioche and caramel sauce and great fruit. All amazing. We also had the lobster and crab salad on brioche and it was finger licking good! Great ambiance and nice servers. All happy and helpful!
Latte's and croissants made by a world class chef. Everything not only look amazing but tasted even better. Friendly service in an inviting atmosphere.  Went back for some deserts for the ride back home.
They have great cannelle. Pistachio gelato was great as well. We also tried their eclair with chestnut cream, which was just sweet enough. Will definitely go there agin when in the area.
Quaint little place packed with locals. Simple club sandwich was out out of this world good. Followed by a hazelnut éclair and perfect start to the afternoon.
Amazing! We came in on a frigid winter day in montreal and smells  instantly overwhelmed us. The display cases were full of the most beautiful and delicious looking pastries. Macarons, tarts, cakes, palmers, croissants, canneles... Mmmmmm... We ended up opting for three canneles, one palmier (it was HUGE) and a chocolate eclair all for take out. Each one was perfect!
Let's just say that my only complaint was that it was pretty hot in the restaurant.  That being said... it was a hot day when we were there which was on Tuesday July 1, 2014.  We sat next to the window which was sunny, adding to the heat.  Otherwise, no complaints.  Food was delicious.  Many people complained about the service, and well, we did have to ask for more water and for our check, otherwise, we may have waited a long time.  But the food was great and the wait staff had great attitudes and were so friendly.  We even had dessert and coffee.  Loved it so much that we went back the following day to get some pastries for our train ride to Toronto.  With better air conditioning, I'd give this 5 stars.  YUM!!
The almond croissant was delightful. They gave me an amuse-bouche as well that was some kind of pate tart, it was actually somewhat similar to the item I ordered. I was actually worried it was the actual dish! Luckily I overheard another server offer the same thing to another patron.Overall, a great little place.
It's in the heart of tourist central, Old Montreal, so you know it's going to be expensive. Luckily the quality of the pastries (mango-raspberry tarts, amazing) and the interior is worth it. Service not really -- though the younger servers were very pleasant the manager was apparently working on his PhD in Arrogant French Caricature. I was seriously looking for the camera, so perfect were the stereotypes.But whatever, don't let that dude ruin your day, make multiple elevator trips up to the toilet on the fourth floor and show him whose Maison this really is.
Incredible patisserie! My brunch yesterday was delicious. I shared chocolate almond croissant, french toast with a caramel syrup, fresh squeezed orange juice. We couldn't resist taking macaroons and pastries home to NYC with us. Everything was perfect!
I got the almond croissant with a cappuccino first time. Both were excellent. I just wish the takeout coffee was bigger. I also came here a second time and tried their brunch. It was excellent and the price was great! I got coffee, a croissant and french toast with eggs benedict for $18!! Everything was excellent.
I've never had a better croissant - I had almond and chocolate almond. We went 2 days in a row because it was so good. Great tea selection, we tried the macarons too - amazing. Can't say enough good things.
Every product looked exquisite when you walked through the doors. The menu prices for dining in also looked quite reasonable (and tasty). Purchased lovely croissants, macaroons and a lemon meringue tart (although it's referred to as something else here). Very helpful service at the counter.
Amazing everything. Not sure if I was ever gonna be able to leave the place!!
i got a bunch of things that I'm not sure I can remember the name of. Overall, everything was amazing and had just the right amount of sweetness, so it wasn't cloyingly sweet. I REALLY enjoyed the passion fruit....tart? I don't know if I can call it a tart, but it was fruity, had great flavor and had this oozy fruit filling that just covered the plate when you cut into it. There was a dessert with a little custard on top and a rum syrup in it which was a little strong and on the sweet side for me. The canele didn't have the best texture ever, but I didn't exactly have it fresh, so that was bad on my part. The flavor had a hint of orange/citrus, I think, that made it so much better than some other caneles I've had. Since canele is one of my favorite desserts, I really appreciated what they did. My second favorite dessert from there was a coffee crumble with lemon curd and what seemed like meringue sticks on top. Coffee and lemon curd was such an interesting combination. I would say that is a must-try. while I was in the elevator en route to the bathrom, the elevator doors opened on the third floor, and I got a small peek into what I was told was the baking school associated with the bakery. I kinda wished I played the dumb tourist card and took a few photos. Darn.
Amazing
Service is pretty bad and eclair or croissant were not good at all. Very much overrated. We had to ask for silverware and water twice. It wasn't very crowded either. Nothing we had was close to average including the brunch plank. Only above average item was the French toast.
What a find!  If you're in Montreal, you would do well to seek out this place.  Fantastic food and pastries served by a friendly and professional wait staff.  Outstanding!  We encountered one couple there who said it was their third visit in two days, because they loved it so much.
Walked by on our first day in Montreal.  Made a mental note and returned the next morning for a quick bite en route to bota bota.Their almond croissant is unlike any other I've tasted.  It's got this creamy paste thing in the center that was just out of this world.  If there was a way for me to ensure that the flaky crusts would remain fresh and crisp, I'd definitely import a few dozen of their goods back to nyc!!
Spent a week in Montreal, everyday seeking good French pastries (the sweet, delicately prepared type) - including using the internet and hotel staff recommendations. We kept striking out until we finally found this place on Yelp.  This was WORTH THE TRIP this afternoon, the last day of our special trip to Montreal. We had two pastries plus cappuccino and took two to go for dinner.  Extremely tasty and the staff was friendly.  Place was very clean and had good ambiance.  We HIGHLY recommend for anyone seeking delicious French pastries.   They also served regular food such as salads, soups and sandwiches, but we did not try.GREAT JOB guys, hope to visit next time we are in town.
Attentive service and delicious food in trendy and fun cafe atmosphere. I had quinoa salad with chicken and vegetable soup. Boyfriend had lobster pastry. We shared a Mille feuille for dessert. I like to think of myself as pastry connoisseur and it wasn't the same as a Parisian Mille feuille but still delicious (pastry sheets were a bit thicker here). Definitely a great lunch spot.
The waitstaff are very helpful. The coffee selection is minimal with a decent choice of French pastries, but not as many as a typical corner bakery in France. $9 for small coffee (expresso), juice, small pastry, and a piece of sweet bread....which is about par for the area.
Best pastries I've ever had in my life. The 5 stars are for the pastries only. I did not have other items on the menu. Seating is limited, but worth the homemade jam serve with Madelines.
Pretty much agree with the consensus. We ordered an almond croissant and a couple of quiches. The croissant was excellent and the quiches were good. They bring you a foie gras appetizer/bite, which is not to be confused for your actual order. A little slow on service at times but was overall a great place to stop for a bite during our explorations of Old Montreal.
This is a quiet little cafe with amazing coffee and pastries. The staff was extremely nice and the prices were reasonable. My husband and I had an Americano and a chocolate croissant........delicious.
This was near my hotel and was drawn to it simply by walking by the doorway one morning.I went every morning for 4 straight days and by the second day they knew the kind of tea I drank and how I liked it. You walk in and the smell is amazing.However that is nothing to the food and pastry.It's not cheap, but you get 10 times in flavor what you pay for.On my last day I loaded up on the jams and goodies to bring home as gifts and ended up keeping most of what I purchased. My first day home, I woke up and missed my window seat table at Maison Christian Faure, my Earl Gray tea and just about everything else about the place.Find time to visit this wonderful experience in sweet, smell, taste and comfort.
Found this place on yelp and it was right around the corner from the hotel I was staying at.  I wanted some french pastry and this place had it.  They had a bunch of fancy stuff but I opted for a chocolate croissant with almond slices on top and some creme filling. Holy crap!!!! Best. Chocolate. Croissant. Ever.
Best almond croissant you will have in beautiful montreal. The decor is beautiful and minimalist. Their server is very polite and they have a great selection of patisseries francaises. Definitely a 5*
A terrific little bakery in a beautiful space in old town, near the (awesome) archaeology museum. The $10 breakfast special - coffees, fresh OJ, pastries of your choice - was a great way to start the day.
I can't believe that that little gem had never been mentioned to me. What a pity that all this time I haven't been blessed with the delicious enlightenment that is le Cartet.To be honest- I've walked by this space several times and just assumed it was a specialty food shop that was ahem, well out of my price range. Don't be deceived like I was; as it turns out it's an amazing sit-down spot as well. My companion had the country-style breakfast, and while the whole thing looked awesome the most note-worthy thing about it is that the potatoes are cooked in duck fat (DUCK FAT POTATOES PEOPLE.) I ordered the "healthy" breakfast plate, complete with goat cheese toast and poached eggs; a yogurt parfait; as well as figs and cheese. yum.The space is exactly what you're hoping for- a cozy and accommodating yet classy spot where even when the place is packed you can hear your brunchin' buddies. I can't wait to bring everyone ever here.
Be sure to arrive early to avoid the line ups!So this is a popular brunch place amongst Montrealers with a shop in front of the restaurant that sells pâté, all sorts of chocolates, goodies, etc. To be completely honest, their food wasn't memorable. I got the Brunch Cartet and the rest of my party got the Brunch Toscan and Brunch de l'Atlantique. I enjoyed the first bite of my salmon cake but then it was just dry afterwards - would be nice to throw some sauce on the side. Our brunch came with orange juice which was a plus.I thought the food was "okay" and nothing more. I wouldn't return.
I believe that Daphne M.'s review says it all. This really is a must when you're in town. My visit wouldn't have been complete without it. Indeed, life itself is more complete now that I've been here.Food: I ordered the hot cast iron thing with meats and beans all around. It was scrumptious! My wife ordered the salmon with baguette because the restaurant didn't get its bagel delivery in the morning, boo! Both were delicious nonetheless. Drink the vanilla latte!Service: extremely friendly and responsive.Decor: it's tight in here, but everything is extremely clean, especially the restrooms.Try to get here early because the line can get really long! Park one block over at the public meters and walk briskly (to stay warm).
Le Cartet has turned me on to the deliciousness that is goat cheese in scrambled eggs, and I will be forever grateful.My boyfriend and I decided to brunch at Le Cartet when we visited Montreal, and I really have to credit Yelp with getting us to check out this cozy spot.When you first arrive, you walk through the small specialty foods area. Chocolate bars of all sorts line the wall just beyond the entrance, and other fun food finds (like maple syrup, coffee and olive oil) are to your left. Looking around is a fun distraction while waiting for your table to be called, which for us took about 15 minutes. We were seated along a long table, hip-to-hip with other diners, but that didn't bother us. I ordered the aforementioned scrambled eggs with goat cheese, which came on bread and also came with potatoes roasted in duck fat and fruit. I ordered a bagel with cream cheese, so I can could try the Montreal bagels I had heard so much about. And again, these eggs! Just do it! My boyfriend got the Brunch de L'Atlantique, which includes a ramekin of scrambled eggs with smoked salmon, half of a smoked salmon bagel, a salmon and sweet potato cake, salad and fruit. Now this is a pretty breakfast! I liked the cake the best. It was very similar to a crab cake. And as if all of this food wasn't enough, we enjoyed mimosas and an amuse-bouche that reminded me of coffee cake. The servers seemed experienced with getting diners through quickly -- a must considering how popular this place seems to be -- but our server was very attentive and polite at the same time. He went through the menu with us in English, and answered each question we had. Happily full after our meal, we then took more time to peruse the specialty food offerings and bought quite a few items to bring home to give to loved ones as souvenirs. Getting a great meal and some shopping done at the same time was such a nice benefit, especially considering we had only a few days to spend in this glorious city. One-stop shopping at its finest!
I was in Montreal for 24hrs with my boyfriend, and while visiting the old city, we decided to have lunch here. The street is pretty, with lots of other restaurants, but somehow we picked this one because of its window with all different products and the big common tables you can see from outside. Such a perfect choice! The atmosphere is lovely. All waitress and I am assuming the owner are ladies, dress in black, super nice. We ordered their lunch specials of sandwich and soup/salad, which came also with fresh bottle of water (free as well as their refills), and bread with butter. The soup was delicious, served inside a tiny pot. My sandwich was amazing, with tons of salmon in it. My boyfriend had a more regular baguette one, but really full of ingredients, with a side of colorful tasty original salad. We really enjoyed, and I suggest this gem to everyone who is visiting the old city! Also, free speedy wifi, and cool crowds.Thank you Le Cartet!
Sunday Brunch Spectacular- had Brunch Cartet which was a plate of scrambled egg, salad, cheese, salmon cake (amazing!), and ham croissant. Show stealer: croissant. So good. Not too flaky but not not too solid either, wasn't too salty or too sweet, simply perfect. Probably the best croissant in montreal. I had the ham removed because i don't eat pork so my croissant came just with cream cheese but I'd rather have nothing on it and just go for plain croissant. I cannot stop fawning about how great the texture and softness of the croissant was. Next time I come, I'm simply getting a good ol' croissant avec cafe.Everything else was great too but honestly the croissant was so good that the rest pales down to it. I also had a latte (they use beans by illy) which was also a rich and smooth blend of milk and coffee, not too bitter. Definitely recommend. All brunch plates also come with bread pudding (not my fav) and (super-duper) fresh orange juice.Best part is the location, situated south of downtown, in the heart of a non-touristy part old port. It's like walking into a perfect life and having your dreams fulfilled in cup of coffee. Great ambience and had a great experience.P.s. hot waiters ;)
This place was off the hook for brunch! Great interior, cute and friendly waiters and a really fantastic ambiance. We were on vacation in beautiful Montreal, and this was comparable to any swank, popular place in my beloved Chicago.I had the Toasta Mixo - Portuguese grilled cheese - for brunch, and it was a LOT of food. A sort of egg sandwich accompanied by a nice fresh salad. It would have been enough for two to share, as it was a ton of food. Illy coffee, which is my FAVORITE. I'd return.
Amazing brunch, combinations were delicious, well thought-out as the flavours complimented each other, and eat plate was crafted masterfully. Has the brunch sucre (sweet) and brunch toscan (savoury) and both were perfect, especially to share to satisfy both senses! The brunch sucre was also not overly sweet. Portions didn't seem overwhelming but filling, the food felt very fresh, light and refreshing however.It's a tad expensive for brunch, but worth the experience. Service was attentive and bilingual! It's a place that quite packed, so don't be surprised of the wait or needing to sit with other people at a table!Would recommend to go to in Montreal and easily could go back if I get the chance!
Been meaning to try this place for brunch for over a year now but never really wanted to brave the cold weather during the 20+ min wait outside.I finally mustered enough courage to go and boy oh boy was it worth it!We shared the Brunch cantons and the Brunch sucré. The beans were just divine! One tiny suggestion for the crepes on the brunch sucré plate: I recommend putting that delicious candied Orange rind and raspberry sauce in the crepe as well. They only smear some on top of it and it's simply not enough! Try the Moka noir orange. Best coffee I've ever had. Lastly, Stephani the waitress was amazing. In a great mood. :) made our brunch all the more better.
We rented an airbnb about 3 stores down from this place and every time we stepped foot outside there was a line coming from Le Cartet that reached our door. My first thought? "Gotta yelp this place" and I did.So we queued up on line one sunny afternoon for brunch. The line moved slowly and a few times I almost made an about face, but thanks to this one overly enthusiastic guy behind me I toughed it out. He raved on and on about the food to some other strangers while he waited for his girlfriend. Some time passes, don't even know how long, and we finally get inside and get seated. As we're sitting down I see a waiter walk by with a carafe of OJ in one hand and a bottle of champagne in another. I told our waitress "I want that" (yes, kind of like a toddler at a candy store). $37 gets you a bottle of champagne with a free carafe of OJ. For two of us, we got about 5 glasses each. Pretty sweet deal.The food here is actually really pricey for brunch dishes, averaging at about $16 per dish. We thanked our lucky stars that the USD was strong so we balled out! I had the Brunch Des Cantons $17.99 (English breakfast style dish: beans, ham, bacon, eggs, sausage in a cast iron skillet) and my boo thang had the Toasta Mixta $11.29 (egg, ham, cheese, onions, and mustard sandwich). Both dishes were overall good but they could use some tweaks. The skillet dish was a little bland and the bread on the sandwich should've been toasted so it can hold better. It just kept falling apart.Service was great. Is this place worth the wait? I'm torn so I'll leave that up to you.
After reading the reviews I expected to be waiting at least an hour! But we got to the restaurant at 10am - minutes from our hotel at nelligan. The wait was about 5 minutes. Very busy, every seat full, but turnover seemed very quick so we were seated promptly!They sell mimosa for early morning cures from night prior! I ordered something that sounded like eggs Benny; but they called it something else. The food was all fresh and if I am not mistaken freshly squeezed juice. The service was wonderful!  The food matched the service and ambiance was very high.Has all the excellent service which was prior provided in Toronto moved to Montreal? What a positive experience, everyone seemed happy but busy. They also have a small store front at the front of the restaurant. When we we're leaving there was a huge lineup. Glad we got there somewhat early!!
My fiance and I made Le Cartet our first grub stop after we arrived in Montreal, starving from our long drive from New York.  The line was literally out the door, with pedestrians struggling to make their way through because hungry folks in line were blocking the wide sidewalk.  Well, despite our hunger, we figured a long line is a good sign, so we waited about 20-30 minutes to get in.We were directed by a friendly staff into the loooooong restaurant.  The long dining tables, which I would unhesitatingly put into my own dining room, were very fitting given the restaurant's length.  Me like!  So we started off with 2 cappucinos.  I ordered the bowl after being informed of the size of the cup, and my fiance ordered the cup.  Yes, I eat like a fat person and it's quite embarrassing when my male partner's portions are smaller than my own.  Anywho, the cappucinos were creamy, frothy and smooth ... a great start to our brunch!I decided to go with the Brunch de L'Atlantique and my fiance went with Brunch des Cantons.  I love salmon so this was the perfect dish for me.  It featured a potato and salmon cake, smoked salmon over bagel and eggs with salmon, sided with salad and fruits.  My fiance's didn't appeal to me too much because I was so absorbed with my salmony meal, but his dish was by far more savory, with sausages, eggs and ham.  Both dishes came with a glass of orange juice, which really filled us up.  I left nothing but crumbs on my plate and left with a happy tummy.  Definitely worth the wait!
Fabulous breakfast/brunch joint. Modern/classy but casual full service cafe/restaurant with small store and takeout near entrance. Gets pretty packed after 10 am weekends. Love the wooden communal tables and the loft style ceilings. Portions are perfect and the coffee is excellent. Great service. Great clean modern décor.
Great service! Came on a weekday at 10am and had great service and no line. It wasn't completely packed. They were nice about letting me practice my French too! Got the brunch des canton! It's all the meat cooked on a cast iron. Also got the mimosa. So good!
Flavor is lost & can't find it's way to Cartet. The brunch is the best meal option here. All in all the place is way overpriced for what you get - middle of the road quality and not always fresh. Beware of the grab and go options. The salads can be old, lettuce wilted, and tasteless across the board. The cookies are hard, and they ain't biscotti. The espresso is Illy brand so it's pretty good. They sell so many food products, it could be a mini (overpriced) general store. If the pickings are slim, which they can be in this area, it is a good bet but Cartet is not a place to go out of your way for. Its a place that's the best of the not so great.
My family and I walked to Le Cartet from our hotel in downtown Montreal and it was a fun experience. The space is much bigger than it appears at first with smaller tables and also family style tables. They were friendly and patient with the two year old in our group, too. The coffee was hot and rich, as was our food. The staff couldn't have been friendlier.
I don't understand how this brunch place gets such amazing reviews. We came during a weekday and the place was filled with tourists. There are no hostesses to seat you; you are expected to simply walk in and find a table. The restaurant is lovely, it has extremely high ceilings, and windows that allow the morning sunshine to pour in. The service is friendly. The food  is just not as spectacular as it appears in the pictures. My partner and I each ordered a scrambled eggs plate. The scrambled eggs with chorizo tasted like something a high school student could've made. The plates were huge, but they looked half empty.  Each plate came with four small pieces of potatoes   and  three pieces of fruit (1 strawberry, 1 slice of orange and 1 slice of grapefruit). The pain brioche was actually 12 grain bread, which I didn't mind.  Then again, they may just be placing whatever they have on hand.  I suppose I am very disappointed because after seeing all the reviews, I was expecting a little more on my plate for the $12 we paid. It was satisfactory for breakfast, but with all the amazing brunch places available in town, I am not sure I would recommend le Cartet at this point. I would have to try one of their bigger plates the next time.
Went to have brunch here with my girlfriends and the vibe was different from all the prior times I've been here.  It could be because there were more out of towners during the weekend.Today's visit was on a Sunday, arrived in line at 11:30 and was seated at 12:25.  The food's taste and presentation was good.  I had the ham omelette grilled cheese with the right amount of mustard seeds.  The salad came pre-dressed with what tasted like Thousand Island, and I thought it was a little too much.  My fave part of this meal was the Café au Lait... It is verrry good!  Just coming here for it is def worth it ;).We got to sit on the long benches with other clients and it kinda felt like Cabane a Sucre.Overall, what I learnt from today is to visit this place on the weekends.....
This is hands down the best breakfast spot in Montreal! Ambiance and service are spot on, it is always busy but you never feel rushed. The coffees and juice are top notch. You have to try the eggs benedict they are phenomenal. I don't know how they get the ham to taste as great as it does. Potatoes roasted in duck fat and fresh fruit round out a fantastic plate. For the quality of food and experience you cannot beat the price either. Can't wait to make it back there!
Le Cartet is a very cozy and great spot for breakfast/brunch/lunch on Rue McGill in Old Montreal. Le Cartet can be very busy on the weekend so get there early if you don't want to wait in line.We went on Sunday morning and we were seated right away. I had a large coffee moka that was served in a bowl. This was very good, a little weak for me, but still a nice coffee and mocha taste.I had the blueberry toast and as others have written, the portion sizes are pretty big. This again was delicious and came with fruits and apple butter.Le Cartet is very popular is seemed with the locals and tourists. That being so, it can get noisy. We were there in June and they had some tables outside also. I enjoyed Le Cartet and would go again when I return to Montreal.
This place is LEGIT for brunch.Me and 3 buddies were in town for the weekend and decided to try the food on a saturday morning. The wait was too long for inside and luckily seats were opening outside which was perfect as the weather reflected our luck. The staff were amazing, very friendly, and very helpful. But the food was the highlight here, it was insane! The portions were really big and perfect to fill our very hungry bellies. The food was really outstanding, all of our dishes were incredible, I wish this place existed for us back home.If i'm ever back in Montreal I will surely be here for sure.
We were there for a weekend brunch. Got the Brunch Sucre and Brunch des Cantons. Both were not good. First, we got a table that was really sloped. After switching table, we got the food. I had Brunch Sucre. It was so average, nothing really stood out at all. The pancake had some raspberry sauce on top, which was sour. The French toast tasted like some pre-packaged banana bread. My boyfriend had Brunch des Cantons, it was greasy. And the dish tasted nothing spectacular. Decor was nice.
This is by far the most delicious brunch I have ever eaten. What a great place- from decor, to staff to drinks, to food. I am so excited to go back already! My mom and I went there early on a Saturday morning, because I was aware of the lineups later on. We both had the brunch santé! It was so much food- all fresh and delicious! The only thing I would change is to use arugula rather than plain romain lettuce.. But oh my god good good good! This is also the first place in Montreal where I have had excellent coffee... I cannot recommend this restaurant enough!!
I went here for brunch with a friend at 12 on a weekday. Although we were disappointed to learn brunch is only on weekends, the lunch menu did not disappoint.We started with the soup of the day and a delicious maple latte. For mains we split the duck and scalloped potatoes (potentially the best I've had) and the pulled pork. We finished off with a piece of deliciously moist carrot cake. Every aspect of the meal was exceptional and the restaurant has lovely vibes.Can't wait to go back for brunch!
I have been to Le Cartet a total of 5 times. Everything is always great. Super fresh ingredients and good service. The wraps are great, the duck confit also great and the brunch also very good.Highly recommend itTHEY DO NOT TAKE AMERICAN EXPRESS
Situated in Old Port, le cartet is great to brunch at and then take a stroll along the water and enjoy the nice weather the menu options all looked delicious, but to ease my guilt about eating out so often , I finally settled on the brunch santé, which consists of organic granola with cashew nuts, yoghurt and blueberries, poached eggs on greens and whole wheat toast, goats milk cheese with pesto (which was spread on the toast), cheddar sticks with fig, and fresh fruits. Each brunch selection also came with a glass of orange juice (with pulp :) ) and amuse-Bouche, which is bite-sized bread pudding with chocolate and caramel (if I understood correctly). The amuse- bouche was pretty good - it wasn't too sweet. The highlight though, was the main meal. I really enjoyed their yogurt with granola - it tasted creamier than the yogurts I buy at the supermarket. I also really enjoyed the poached eggs on toast - the goats cheese and pesto made it very tasty and flavourful (normally, I don't like goat cheese because I think the flavour is too strong, but this wasn't the case at all here!)My friend got the toasted banana and coconut bread, which came with fresh fruit and yogurt with blueberries. I tried a bit of her bread, and we both enjoyed it very very much! Overall, the staff was friendly, and the food was delicious! They also have a few outdoor tables. Will definitely be back to try their other menu items!
Situated in Old Montréal, Le Cartet offers healthy yet gourmet European style breakfast at moderate pricing.For coffee, the restaurant uses Illy espresso, a great coffee with its roots in Italy, and my breakfast tea was from Paris, from the brand Kusmi Tea. What I found interesting and thoughtful was that the milk for my tea was frothed!The restaurant opens at 7am and serves their breakfast until 11am. We arrived at 7:30am, and by 8 o'clock, we were very surprised to see the restaurant fully packed with a line forming at the front waiting for tables! Our advice to you is to arrive before 8am and beat the morning rush. The restaurant offers a great vibe in their loft-like space, and is a great place to bond with your colleagues or friends. If you're looking for a quick coffee, the restaurant has an open coffee bar at the front which operates much like a café to get your caffeine fix. They also have a great selection of pre-packaged foods for a quick lunch midday, ranging from salads, yogurt bowls, pasta, and much more.I had Le Brunch Sucre. Because of its name, I expected most of my breakfast to be very sweet. To my surprise, most of the foods were sweet, but very balanced. For example, the raspberry jam on my crepe was more acidic than sweet. This is probably because they didn't add as much sugar than your generic jam company does, which provided a much refreshing taste when eaten together with the maple syrup.The yogurt and their granola also blew me away. The granola was tasted nothing different at the beginning, but as I kept eating it with the yogurt, I found myself tasting the ginger more gradually and realized that I didn't really need the honey to sweeten it. This means a lot, from someone that loves their things, especially yogurt, sweet! The yogurt was great; it seemed very fresh, thick, and dense in consistency. It balanced everything else in the bowl very well. I saw many women ordering the yogurt bowl as part of their breakfasts, and I agree, it's a great way to start your morning!The butter and maple syrup that the restaurant provided was quite different from the typical store-bought (or mass produced) goods as well. The butter tasted amazing, and was very light and fluffy in texture - not the hard and dense kind you see most of the time. The apple butter on the french toast was my favourite, and had to really hold myself back from buying a jar of it on my way out. It really was a perfect pairing with the french toast, and a great alternative to having your typical syrup and butter on it.Overall, I really recommend this breakfast to anyone that's looking for a sweet yet healthy option. The restaurant offers breakfast every weekday from 7am-11am, and also offers a weekend brunch both Saturday and Sunday from 9am to 3:30pm.
I've been to tons of brunch in Toronto and it just doesn't stack up to the ambiance you get in old montreal.  This place gets crazy packed if you go at peak hours but we were lucky enough to walk in and be seated within 5 minutes on a Saturday afternoon.I had the brunch cartet and was tempted to order more because I was hungry.  Glad I didn't.  You get a massive plate of every item on the breakfast menu and they all include a convenient mimosa option.  Coffee is delicious and not run of the mill big box stuff.  You can buy it by the ounce at the boutique at the front.  Speaking of the boutique, you can find everything there from truffle oil to chocolate spreads to takeout food.... They need to make one of these in Toronto...
A few days ago, my friend and I went to Le Cartet around noon in hopes of catching a late breakfast. Unfortunately we had just missed breakfast time by thirty minutes but decided to stay anyway -- Very glad we did!Food: Cauliflower soup - Served in individual mini Le Creuset dutch ovens. Major fan of not just the presentation but also the creamy and flavourful soupDuck leg with scalloped potatoes and arugula salad - Duck leg was very filling (in a good way) and scalloped potatoes were so, so satisfying. Neither of us like arugula and forgot to sub it out but it did look good. Pulled pork sandwich - Chips and pickles on the side. A bit of a kick to the pulled pork, brioche bun was on point, perfectly toasted. Carrot cake - Soooooo moist. Cream cheese icing was tart and not too sweet. Tons of nuts and raisins in the cake. Perfect way to end off the lunch Maple latte - Very smooth and well, maple-yService - Attentive, efficient and knew the menu very wellDecor - Clean cut, light wooden tables. Perfect for breakfast, lunch, business meetings etc. Boutique and ready to eat dishes at the front. Was swayed by the maple chocolate on the way out!
Cute Cafe that exceeds your expectations at every corner. Looks quite small from the outside but plenty spacious when you get in. It gets busy fast so it's best to get in when they open or reserve a table in advance. Food was delicious, fresh and relatively healthy. The hot chocolate was amazing. They used real cocoa which has this lovely subtle sweetness to it that's not overbearing. However if you have a sweet tooth they give you a packet of raw sugar on the side. My girlfriend had the mocha and it too was quite delicious. I've never had a great mocha, and this cute little Cafe hit the spot. Food was in generous portions and cheap compared to most brunch places. If you're looking for a nice, quiet morning brunch then this is the place for you. If can get busy but overall the ambiance and staff are quite charming.
We wondered here on a Sunday AM for brunch and the line was out the door! I think we ended up waiting around 30 min so I guess it wasn't too bad. I really dislike their system of waiting in line... Can't we put down our name and number and have the restaurant call us? That way we're not stuck standing and waiting!Once inside, there are large communal tables, but we were lucky enough to get one for two. I had their smoothie of the day to start and it was so refreshing! I liked how it just tasted like a mix of all sorts of fruits blended with light ice. For my meal I had the Brunch Toscan. The eggs were cooked nicely and the dish was very filling. I wouldn't say this was the best thing I've ever eaten, but it was decent. The reason why I'm giving it so many stars is thanks the whole ambiance of the place! There's also a little market in the front where you can buy pre packaged foods to go as well as different snacks. It's such a cute place!
More like 3.5 stars. I was fortunate enough to arrive a bit late by VIA Rail to Montreal so I did not have to wait particularly long for my table for one. The seating is communal-esque so get ready to get comfortable with the people sitting around you. I had the Brunch de L'Atlantique which is a salmon lovers delight. It had a smoked salmon scramble, a salmon cream cheese bagel, a salmon cake and a salad. The food was very good as was the coffee and the portions were very on point. However, the brunch was very much on the spendy side. I don't mind paying a lot for food - but there was nothing terribly unique about what I had which is why I'm knocking this place down a tad. This is definitely a convenient and nice place to brunch, but with so many options around - I would be more open to trying different alternatives.
I really enjoyed the cappuccino. The food I ordered was really yummy. I liked the blueberry yogurt with granola and fruit.One missing star is because Mr. T. He never likes the scrambled eggs and beans. But his dish had them both.
Rules for visiting Montréal:1. Go to Le Cartet Boutique for brunch. 2. I don't care what else you do after. 3. Confirm that step 1 was done.When visiting a city, I love finding the places locals like to eat (doesn't every yelper?). I'm intimidated by all things French, but Le Cartet had such glowing reviews, I couldn't say no. Awesome decision. The brunch menu has tons of variety, so whether you're in the mood for meat with a side of meat (ham, sausage, and bacon in one dish!) or a simple serving of fresh fruits, they have it. Prices are reasonable, especially after the USD to CAN conversion, so go nuts and get a mimosa while you're at it. Service was great, our server was friendly and our food came out pretty quickly considering how busy the place was. I got the L'Atlantique dish which had a salad, an open face smoked salmon with schmear bagel, fresh fruits, and some apple chocolate chip thing I can't pronounce. I was also supposed to get a sweet potato fritter thing, but the server told me earlier they were out and would substitute by pretty much giving me more of everything else. Cool.Whatever the hell the chocolate chip apple thing was,  it was DELICIOUS.  Super moist and not too sweet, I would have preferred to have it at the end of my meal instead of the beginning, but I devoured it nonetheless. The salad was perfectly dressed and the everything about the dish garnered zero complaints from me. Like I said, they didn't have the fritter that came with my meal, so I'm not sure if the scrambled egg with salmon was a replacement or normal part of the meal. All the fruits were at the peak of freshness and sweetness, too. My friend got the very simple scrambled eggs with goat cheese on toast.. and if I could give it ten stars, I would. If you can make something simple taste out of this world, that's a dang gift. All the right balance of salty, creamy, rich, crunch from the toast and sweetness from the side of fresh fruit made this so incredible that we're seriously considering going back to Montreal just to eat here again.
High end without being pretentious. Very nice place to get a breakfast that is different than the traditional greasy sausage and greasy eggs. This place offers a light airy breakfast with out of this world hand made croissants. I have been here a bunch of times and nothing I have eaten on the menu leaves you feeling all greased out and every time I leave satisfied and full.It's a little pricey, I mean a LITTLE bit pricey but the trade off of money vs quality is very well proportioned.
Pros: Beautiful setting, Delicious& Fresh food, Great serviceCons: Possible wait times, Food baby inducing, Busy-Ambiance- Very nice place to have weekend brunch, a lot of sunshine and open windows perfect to cure that night before hangover.  There is seating outside at the front and inside the restaurant as well as a quaint section selling treats at the front. Our server was phenomenal and was very enthusiastic throughout the whole service; explaining items and catering to all of our particular food needs.  Food ranges from 5-25$.-Food- Coupe Santé:  Yoghurt+ Granola+ Fruits. Ordered this to keep it light and I was very much satisfied. The fruits were fresh and varied,  the granola was in-house made  and still warm, and the yogurt was light and creamy. What more can you ask for. Trois Minutes: Two soft-boiled eggs with bio toast, duck fat potatoes, fresh fruit and jam.  Straightforward plate with quality ingredients. We also got the organic peanut butter, which was god-sent. -Overall- Go for weekend brunch don't be health conscious pansies like us and get the big brunch plates. Enjoy delicious&fresh food in a beautiful setting with good company.
Pretty good place where your not just getting the same old bacon and eggs that 90% of restaurants serve you...The menu has lots of interesting items, great presentation, outstanding dishes and kind of like to get my breakfast served in a hot pan lol
A couple friends of mine came to visit Montreal so I decided to take them here for lunch while we were around Old Montreal. We came at around 2pm and were seated quite promptly (glad we came a bit later since I heard this place can get pretty busy!) Their brunch menu has a good variety catered for different people - ex. A 'brunch santé' for the healthier individual, a 'brunch sucré' to satisfy one's sweet tooth etc. In the end I chose the 'brunch toscan' - english muffin served with potatoes, fruit and orange juice - which definitely satisfied my stomach. Food was also very visually pleasing!The atmosphere is very friendly and charming and we had good, attentive service throughout the meal. My friends were even able to get some souvenir shopping done since they have a little boutique at the entrance. It's definitely pricier than most brunch places, though understandable considering its location in Old Montreal. Overall a pleasant experience!
After trying many of the Montreal breakfast/brunch places, decided to give this place a shot as well due to the good ratings on yelp.  It's close to the bus stop I regularly takes, which makes it super convenient.  A cute joint with very friendly staff.  Open kitchen, open market, grab stuff to go, bakery counter as well as plenty of tables to sit down.  Some of the smaller tables are a bit too close to each other for my taste, but guess it's quite common in Montreal restaurants.  It's almost like eating with your neighbours with 2 inches away from their tables.  I had the "speculoo latte", which I was very excited to see.  After spending one summer in Belgium, Im totally in love with Speculoo and was very surprised to see they offered it.  Well, I was quite disappointed.  It's more a latte with a lot of cinnamon powders on the top, I didn't taste any speculoo at all or no signs of speculoo anywhere.  I had the very popular Brunch Atlantic, which is a smoked salmon heaven.  The 1/2 bagel with the smoked salmon was perfectly crispy and right amount of cream cheese.  The salmon scramble was great with very fluffy eggs and bits of smoked salmon.  The salmon cake was unnecessary since it wasn't great.  It's very dry and hard.  It's a pretty bad salmon and potato croquette.  Fresh fruit and salad on the side was refreshing and nice.  And even comes with a juice.  For $19, it seems a bit steep, but with the free juice and the quality overall, it's a pretty good deal. Plus the staff was all very friendly which made the experience even more enjoyable.  Stopped by the bakery to get some of their almond cakes to go.  The matcha almond cake was to die for.  Perfectly crispy on the outside and moist and nice flavour inside.  Definitely try that if you can.  The chocolate cherry muffin was too sweet for my taste and not a lot of cherries inside.  Overall, a place that I'd return and I think its'a sold place to go for breakfast/brunches.    Pretty popular place and doesn't take reservations, I'd go early or expect a queue.
I've come here alot for lunch. Eaten here and bought meals from their 'grocery' section. They're really..... Hit or miss sometimes. I'd say 80% of the time, their meal of the day is a hit... But you don't really know what the meal will be ahead of time and sometimes the meal itself might not be your thing. Their duck confit with side of salad has been 60% hit, 40% miss. When it misses, it feels like the duck is old. I don't know how else to describe it. Their sandwiches are usually good but when they're not, it's probably because the inside is still cold and you realize they probably just half heated it up when they took it from the grocery section. The foods from their grocery section I've enjoyed but check the packaged date. I would try to go for items packaged today or yesterday. Their cookies are delicious. Even if they're 4$ a pop.
I ordered the scrambled eggs with asparagus and cheddar; my toast was burnt and the potatoes were just thrown on the plate I think. They lack flavor and don't fit well with the dish. The dish came with fruits but again, I think they were just thrown onto the plate. The hubby got The Toscan and our plates did not have the same number of fruits. I like plating consistency esp when you can count the fruits (I had one less strawberry, pineapple and orange i.e. I only had three fruits on my plate). I really wasn't impressed with the food hence the harsh rating. There are better brunch places in the city than this place. I wouldn't go back.
Breakfast so yummy , their latte is  really good, the staff are very friendly, I ordered the "brunch des canton",the roasted potatoes in duck fat is really phenomenal.
Came here during lunch with a few friends on a Monday. We were seated quickly but the servers took forever to take our orders and even forgot a part of our order. It wasn't even that busy as it was nearing the end of lunch. The pulled pork sandwich was okay. Moist but not very well flavored. The bread was well toasted but bland. The dish was just boring. The salmon tartar was delicious, as was the Bloody Caesar. I was told the gazpacho and chicken sandwich was good. The fish of the day, a white fish, was also bland and dry on the inside.
AMAZING!  The scrambled eggs and goat chess?  To die for!  Everything was superb, including service. You may wait 20 min for acc table, but holy heck us worth it! ! I you must go!
As always, Le Cartet is a nice place to walk into for a well balanced and portioned meal.The Lasagna and Duck Confit are good choices and surprisingly not heavy as one would think.They are welcoming, nice and attentive. Well done and thank you guys.
Everything is good, the decor, the ambiance, the service and the food. The only drawback for me is the price...it's a little steep for brunch.
Le Cartet is a great brunch spot in Old Montreal. While vacationing there with my family last month, we came for brunch on a Sunday morning. I had read that the wait could get pretty long, so we made sure to get there bright and early at 9:30. When we arrived, it was surprisingly almost full already! But luckily we were able to snag one of the few spots left at the long communal table.Two of us ordered the Brunch Toscan, and the other two ordered the Brunch de L'Atlantique. The brunch plates were all huge, and came with a glass of orange juice and coffee each. My Brunch Toscan included poached eggs on English muffins with Mornay sauce, duck fat potatoes, and fresh fruit (orange, grapefruit, and pineapple). The Brunch de L'Atlantique included a smoked salmon bagel, scrambled eggs, salad, sweet potato pancake, and fruit. Everything was delicious, though it seemed like the Brunch de L'Atlantique came with a lot more food!One side of the restaurant is a shop selling chocolates, jams, and other goods, so if you end up waiting for a while you at least have something to look at while you wait. Definitely arrive as early as possible to avoid long lines.
A bit expensive to eat sandwichs... Place is good, service is good but too expensive.
If you are visiting Montreal, staying in Old City and want a great breakfast, this place is a MUST!!! My wife and I are Americans and used to big breakfast plates and we were not disappointed. They do a superb job at putting a unique French spin on breakfast. Their customer service is genuine (we went twice with different servers) and fast and the food is AMAZING!!! I enjoyed their salmon breakfast plate and their version of eggs Benedict. You will love it!
So far this is my favorite restaurant in Montreal!Excellent food and service for a good price. The brunch menu is to die for, lots of healthy option and it's vegetarian friendly. Good coffee as well!
I'm still a bit stuffed from eating here so I thought it would be a great idea to write my review while my memory of the place is fresh and clear.We stumbled across Le Cartet after receiving the cold shoulder over at Olive & Gourmando and while in many regards I'm very glad we did, I do have to say that I had numerous disappointments when you compare price with product.Let's start with the good, eh?The space is open and clean, and houses not only the bustling restaurant but also a small store that sells (overpriced) food items.  Gave us lots to watch.  It is LOUD in there so you might want to cure that hangover a bit before heading in...I had a clear view of the folks behind the counter and everyone was hustling their butts off to try to ensure things - juices, coffees, food - were doled out quickly.English menu had the same items as the French one which is always a welcome experience.Communal seating.  It gave us an opportunity to strike conversations with people on both sides of us.Espresso was excellent.Wait time was reasonable.The ham on the des Cantons plate was one of the best meats I've ever had.  I normally eschew pork products (except when in Prague and at my Grandma's during the holidays) but when the hubby told me I needed to try it (from his plate) then I did.  Actually, all the ham was excellent because my croissant with goat cheese and ham was great as well.  I'd normally have passed the meat off to him but this time I actually ate it!  It wasn't as good as his portion due to different curing/prep styles but it was still better than 98% of the ham I've ever eaten.Server was friendly.Now, on to the bad.The seating system is stupid.  On a rainy day we were lucky to already have made it into the doorway but the people behind us were drenched and confused.  There is no name taking.  Stay in line or else you lose your place.  And in a narrow entrance you constantly have to move around to ensure everyone is getting where they need to be.  God forbid you try to walk past everyone to look in the store or they'll snipe and snarl at you about breaking line.  Sheesh.  Hangry folks over there.  Just trying to pass the time, ok?While our server was friendly she was non-existent.  We never got our orange juice that was included in the meal because by the time she (or anyone) showed back up we were too full to want it anymore.  But since we technically paid for it I think they should have brought it with our food, no?  Especially since they allow absolutely NO SUBSTITUTIONS.  The couple next to us was trying to have a plate with no pork and the refused to remove it from the croissant (where it's just placed in) and had them order a la carte at a cost of almost $8 more.  To NOT have an item?  Especially when they explained it was for religious purposes?  That's sillier than the seating system.The juice isn't fresh squeezed even though I was told it was.  As I was drinking my average tasting mimosa I witnessed them pop open a fresh jug o' juice with a distinct distribution label.  I don't mind a good jug o' juice.  Really.  But don't tell me you squeeze your juice when you don't.  And then not bring it to me.  I'm still a bit miffed about not getting my juice I guess.Bloody Mary is weak and out of a can.Salad was hot.  Not 'wilted' warm but downright hot.  Weird?Eggs were way overcooked but, again, we had no one to tell to rectify that situation.Really a 2.5 star experience but rounding down when factoring in cost.  For over $65 for breakfast for two people I don't think I'll be back nor could I recommend.
Location: Tucked away in the Old Port. The closest subway is Square Victoria, street parking is available but good luck with that. If you're downtown, it's an easy walk so you can skip transit if you want to get some cardio in.The place: Le Cartet is not excessively big but the layout is good, with simple decor and a pretty plentiful boutique at the front. There's usually a line-up on weekends so you'll want to plan accordingly. We arrived around 10:45 and had to wait, but only for about 15-20 minutes. The goods: I went for the 2 eggs with goat cheese on toast, with a side of potatoes (like, about 4 of them). Can't say one bad thing about this simple but tasty breakfast. The eggs were perfectly scrambled and fluffy and had the right amount of cheese, the bread was fantastic (a multigrain, I think) and the potatoes were good. They also know how to make a mean Macchiato, which always makes me happy since many places do not. Quality goods, all around.Service: The service was good, though the waiter couldn't seem to get our bills right. He had to reprint them twice, and both times, they were wrong.   Price point: I forget the exact amount, but it was on par with other breakfast places in town. Their storefront boutique offers a ton of stuff - so if you're in the area and want to grab something real quick, stop in!
This place is amazing!!!  I'm a huge breakfast person so everywhere I go I try and find the best breakfast joint.  I'd say this is the one for Montreal.  It was very crowded on a Sunday morning as I thought it would be but there were a ton of breakfast places near by and they didn't have a line like this one did which tells you how good they are.  We waited about 10 minutes till we were finally sat but in the meantime we perused the little shop they have in front with the pate's, pastries, and jellies.  I ordered a latte which was perfect with the asparagus scrambled eggs.  The eggs were probably the best scrambled eggs I've ever had and the fruit that came with it was actually fresh and delicious.  My bf had a few pastries that they warmed up for us and all of them were delicious.  I'd definitely recommend this place!
Wow just wow. We arrived a few minutes after 9am on a Sunday, and I must say I was surprised by how quickly all the tables around us filled up and how many people came in and out for take out, etc. (Note the outside tables are for eat-in diners only you naughty to-go sandwich grabbers).They have gorgeous huge brunch platters as their signature dishes for eat in and yum yum yum was it worth every penny. The first thing to note is the emphasis on the brunch element of the brunch platter - this will do you for two meals. My "Le Cartet" plate came with a ham and goat cheese croissant (buttery, flaky, light cheesy, smoky ham, YUM), a scrambled egg, a small cup of greek yogurt, a fruit shish kabob (strawberry, orange, grapefruit, pineapple), two slices of cheese, a fig, a salmon cake, and mesclun salad.) WHEW. I could not eat it all. The mimosa was quite strong with pulpy (fresh squeezed?) orange juice. Presentation is important to me, I like my food to look and smell good as well as taste spectacular, and here, too, Le Cartet was a huge hit. The fruit shish kabob was cute, and the salmon cake served as a nice hub for a hub and spoke-esque plate presentation. In addition the plates come with coffee and juice! And I almost forgot the beginning of the meal - a coffee cakeish amuse bouche. Delightful! Each of the flavors was smooth and tasty - not too much salt, everything was balanced by lovely creaminess. Service was attentive, informative, and excellent.
I ordered the brunch cartet and my frend ordered brunch sucre. They are really yummy!! The smoothie of the day is great. But we couldn't not finish them. For girls, you can order two brunches for three or even one for two persons :(But the environment was too noisy I cannot hear my friend talking
Hubby & I came here for weekend brunch. Had the Toasta Mixta and Blueberry French Bread. Very fresh & tasty! Also had a mimosa which was so good. Be prepared, there does tend to be a wait and not all tables are private/separate seating. The second time we came, we got seated in the middle of a long table, with different groups on either end.
If you are looking for a place to brunch in Montreal, look no further. Le Cartet is where it's at! Their brunch options are great as you can get an appetizer, main course and mimosa for under $20. There are also lighter options for those who are not as hungry. I ordered the Trios Minutes which was a boiled egg with 2 whole wheat toasts and fruit. It was great for a light breakfast. My sister ordered the Brunch De L'Atlantique which was a seafood's lover dream. It included 1/2 smoked salmon bagel, scrambled eggs with salmon and a salmon cake. This was served with fruit as well. Le Cartet also has a baked goods and specialty foods section which is great to pick up something after your meal. I got an almond croissant for a snack on the road back to Toronto. I will definitely go back when I visit Montreal again.TIP: Make sure to go early to get a table. It can get quite packed!
Amazing breakfast! I had the scrambled eggs with cheddar cheese and asparagus. Perfectly almost runny eggs on top of country bread. Small portions as the eggs don't cover all the bread. It's about 2 scrambled eggs on top of meant for 3 scrambled eggs. The cheese isn't overwhelming where there is too much or an afterthought where it is put on top after. The duck fat roasted potatoes were rich so don't be alarmed by the fact that there are only 4 halves. You won't eat more than that. The fruit was a nice touch with grapefruit, orange, pineapple and strawberry. My boyfriend had the weekday special of scrambled eggs, beans, ham, bacon, sausage, duck fat roasted potatoes with country bread on the side. The bacon was okay. The sausage was very hard and dry. The ham was however fall of the bone soft and juicy and amazing. Next time I would def do the ham and cheese scrambled eggs.
Waited 40min for this place, definitely definitely worth it!! Once seated, the service was excellent, and the food was delicious. If we hadn't been a bit hungover from being out at Stogies the night before, I would have had a mimosa, they looked awesome. My bf had a skillet of eggs, meat, sausage, and potatoes. I had the eggs with Mornay sauce on an English muffin with ham and spinach. I love how their ham and other meats here is actual ham, not that processed slab of crap you get in the States.There was some other platter that came with fruit and a croissant that looked awesome that I will get next time I go for sure. A definite must if you're visiting Montreal.
The service was good, but the food was not worth what they charge you IMO. $18+ for undercooked bacon (even though it's served on a hot cast iron skillet), hard beans, dry toast- ehhhh. The ham and sausage were good though and the complimentary bread pudding to start is nice.
I loved this place.  Maybe not everyone will agree.   I've gone here twice during my month stay in Montreal's old city district.  The first time I went I had a tofu salad with quinoa (which was good) and the second time I got a selection of croissant, pudding cake, and petits fours (arachide et choco pistache).   Whereas I find there food to be solidly average but a bit overpriced, I am really impressed by their baked goods which are also quite reasonably priced ($2.00 for a croissant, $5.29 for a bag of petits fours, presumably baked on site) and perfectly delicious.   This place is worth gaining a kilo or two during my vacation :-).Oh! And I should also add they appear to have an extensive chocolate bar selection, both international and quebecois.  I will definitely be going back for those!
Very solidly good breakfast, eggs were cooked perfectly. Fast, nice service. They also sell a selection of gourmet foods, jams, chocolate, etc., which was very cool.
The lunch is just ok.. The soup is ok. The salad is great. The pasta is great as well. However, the meat of the day is lamb+pumpkin. The taste is a little bit weird. The fruit salad is not very fresh.
Delicious breakfast. Unique plates and combinations. Tables are a bit tightly packed.
What stood out to me most was the lovely staff. The food is pretty good, but not mind-blowing. I'd still go back though.
We ate here twice on a recent long weekend in Montreal. I love the food and the atmosphere. My wife found her crepes (Sunday brunch) were a little heavy. My eggs with the Mornay sauce were heavenly and came with fresh squeezed orange juice! The wait staff were also superb. Highly recommend for breakfast and brunch.
If you're standing in line for brunch while you read this, please reconsider. There are probably a thousand places that are just as cute within walking distance. Get on your Yelp app and find one of them before you get cranky.We came on a weekday late-morning for brunch and it was still packed with tourists. Which is not a bad thing per se, but it does overburden the staff, who were unsmiling and clearly in the weeds despite the off-hour.Both of our orders were messed up, but we ate them anyway (see above under "cranky"). They were ok, but we're talking about straightforward variations on eggs and potatoes. The space is beautifully designed, hovering somewhere between rustic and hip, but it was filled with flies (see above under "please reconsider"). Yelp has rarely steered me wrong, but this a disappointment that I (as a tourist) felt partly responsible for.
Waiting time is a bit long on this Sunday morning (expected I guess) but the brunch plates are worse it! Fresh orange juice and amazing "latte with maple syrup"!! Must come back and try all the other dishes.
Food & Drink- I always get a benedict or poached egg dish for breakfast, brunch here was no different. The eggs were poached perfectly just the way I like them. - They don't use hollandaise sauce on the benedict, which I would have preferred, but their sauce was also nice and creamy, but not the taste I'm used to. - A side of fruit and potatoes are included - but not much as the benedicts are pretty heavy in themselves. The potatoes are cooked in duck fat and taste divine. - The benedict comes with a fresh glass of OJ, I LOVE FRESHLY SQUEEZED OJ!!- Latte was goodService- The service was great from beginning to end- The waiters were very busy, but came by to check on us at all the right times. We never felt rushed.- The waiters made sure food and drinks came to use in a timely manner after we ordered.
If you're stuck at this part of the Old Port and you have nowhere else to go, ok. Otherwise, there are bunch of other places in Montreal with 10 times better service. The food is ok, nothing special. But I think they don't think their customers as returning customers they don't really care about the service that much. If you're a tourist in Montreal, it means that you have the time to take the cab or the metro to go places. Spend 20 more minutes and go to Lawrence, Manitoba or VORO. Eat better, experience a nicer place. At the end, that's why you're visiting Montreal!If you're a local, I'm pretty sure you won't go here anyways, unless your friends are like "Oh, we found this place but don't remember the name. Let's go there." then you end up here.
We rolled in around 11 for brunch at Le Cartet during a recent vacation and were seated after about a 15-minute wait.  Very tasty; I went with the Brunch des Cantons, which had a ton of meats in a skillet with some eggs and potatoes.  Not earth shattering, but very solid and makes me think I have been getting Canadian bacon all wrong!  Had this with a mimosa on the side and one of their croissants.  I'm not sure I would need to run back here, but my experience was fine and my wife seemed to enjoy herself also.Picnic table-style seating will turn some people off, so if you want a "private" place to eat, Le Cartet is not your boy.  Our service was great, but at the table next to me, the couple who sat down right as we sat down didn't get their food right away and were just getting their brunches as we were leaving.  I'm not sure if that level of inconsistency is normal, but I saw it first-hand!
Two words. ALMOND CROISSANT.It's huge [insert 'that's what she said' joke here] and has a good amount of almond filling. So I would try to split it with someone as a dessert (rather than try to devour the whole thing as breakfast like I did) because it can be a little too heavy for the morning hours.Le Cartet is a cute cafe with plenty of seating. They sell European snacks/gifts in the front (such as jam, candy, coffee, etc.) You can also get your coffee to go. And it ain't just 'coffee' anymore. So many different varieties to choose from!Service was quick (and they're nice enough to give you their wifi password if you're not from town). Do yourself a favor and go get that croissant, NOW!
Came here for brunch with the hubby for Family day weekend.  There was a line up (as per usual) but thankfully the line was still inside and not in the freezing Montreal cold.  We got a seat after 15 min of waiting and they seated me even though my husband wasn't in line with me yet. My husband ordered the brunch des cantons which was a skillet with scrambled eggs, beans and an assortment of meat.  The beans weren't from a can and had a nice sweetness to it.  There was some pork which pretty much melted in your mouth because it was so tender.  The other meats in the skillet were rather lacklustre.  I ordered the scrambled eggs with cheese and asparagus.  It was warm but not hot - there was a significant difference in temperature between my husband's dish and my own (and yes I know his was in a cast iron skillet but still, food should be hot).  The eggs were cooked well (not overdone) but the lack of seasoning and relatively cool temperature of the dish made it a bit off putting. I also ordered a smoothie which interestingly wasn't very chilled (I prefer my smoothies nice and cold) but was otherwise quite tasty.  My husband ordered a bowl of latte which had a very milky taste. Overall, le cartet is good but not great. I don't think I would come back here...if I wanted to wait in line for brunch I think there are better places to go.
There are brunch spots that make bacon and eggs, and then there's Le Cartet. Flawlessly executed breakfasts, great service and an excellent atmosphere, this is probably the most fun I've had at brunch in a while.  It's a little pricey, but you definitely get what you pay for.
Delicious food. Outstanding service. Great vibe. Loved the cappuccino and egg scramble. The fresh yogurt with granola was a standout. They overcharged us for one item, but still forgiven.
Breakfast sausage was nearly as dry as salami? Egg had the consistency of egg that's been under a heat lamp for a half-hour.The coffee here, and frankly at every restaurant I've visited in Montreal, is like Startbucks' drip on a bad day. Hoping to have better luck at a coffee-centric cafe.The only thing good here was the croissant sandwich, which even these guys couldn't get wrong...
We had a quick lunch here.  Considering Montreal host some of the most wonderful cafe and restaurants in the world, we were disappointed.  The cappuccino was a bit diluted.  I had made a mistake to order the cheese plate.  The cheese were in huge square chucks.  They looked like regular packaged grocery store cheese.  The bread didn't taste fresh.  We will not come back again.
I love this place.  The latte's are amazing and their egg dishes are perfect....  I recommend goat cheese scramble with asparagus.  Wonderful!  Lovely, clean environment as well.
Le Cartet is one great place to try for breakfast with their interesting concept of boutique restaurant. Plus, they offer a wide range of products such bottled smoothies, sandwiches, salads, pastries and more. Laid-back crowd, cozy ambiance and delicious food. What can you ask for more? If the weather is great, you can even sit outside. This place definitely get off the beaten track.
This is my go-to brunch place. My boyfriend and I are here almost every weekend, without fail, and the staff knows us. The portions are large, the quality excellent, and the service fast and friendly. The line can get a bit long, but usually with a party of 2 the wait is no longer than 10 minutes. That being said, the wait feels fast I because the walls are covered in exotic chocolate and there is the little market in front with gourmet goods. I always enjoy browsing this section when we're with a bigger group and the wait is long.In terms of best menu items: the latte bowl is a must! No weekend is complete without it. The hot chocolate is also extremely delicious. My favourite brunches are Brunch Sante and Atlantique, but my boyfriend swears by Le Cartet brunch. To be honest, you can't really go wrong here. I highly highly recommend it.
Ambience is great! It wasn't busy and it felt like a great place to sit and do some work for a couple hoursFood was eh. I got the brunch cartet and while tasty, was more like a bunch of random things thrown on the plate.
Love the cozy atmosphere of this place. Little gourmet shop up front where you could shop for a picnic, pastries or fine chocolate to go.For brunch I had the blueberry French toast. It was made on heart bread and topped with homemade apple butter, wild blueberries and sides of maple syrup and whipped cream. Great with kids.
This place was great! Authentic, fresh, cozy, tasty! Close to downtown and the Old City. Just fabulous brunch!!
Had a poached egg and duck brunch. The plate was exquisite, service was top notch and the ambiance was excellent. Just what the doctor ordered. And everyone that works here is a professional. That's quite rare. To top it off, the quality you get for the price is probably unique in MTL for breakfast/brunch. Healthy and more more decadent options are available, the coffee is great and the staff is friendly. Posted this while still seated. Must try.
Love this place. The breakfasts and brunches are original and delicious, and the coffee excellent. Service is fast friendly and attentive. The one downside is that you often have to wait for a table, especially if you want to sit outside. It's well worth the wait.
Arrived just a bit too late for breakfast so we had sandwich. Very good ham and cheese with gazpacho. Very welcoming atmosphere and not very  crowded at lunch time on a Monday. We also had pulled pork and chichen sandwich. The chicken was the beat thing on the table. Will be returning anytime we are in Montreal.
Very good service and atmosphere. Slightly over priced but mind you it's in touristy area of the city. Food quality is very good but it's not the best.
I came here by accident, thought I would have gotten brunch but turned out it was a little bit too late for that. Nonetheless, location wise, this plate is located a little bit far down in a remote area of old port. The restaurant itself is nice, cozy and I love the ambiance of the restaurant. They also sell a small amount of different type of food ranging from to go soup to coffee. Indeed, it does look like a cool spot to enjoy a cup of tea or coffee along side a dessert.Anyway, I had to opted for the meal plate of the day a western variation of Middle East couscous with merguez sausages and cury chicken. Anywho, the plate was okay, I didn't personally fancy this couscous because I thought it lacked some flavour. The sausages didn't have the authentic flavour but still had a western juice inside. Nonetheless, props to the chicken it was cooked perfectly and had an excellent taste. The plate also came with a salad, that was obviously fresh and done with great care.My partner had a latte and a fruit salad. No bad points about these two choices since they both were excellent .Overall , this place feels like a really good joint for coffee or brunch. Anyway , I hope other Yelpers will get to try this place and will love it . I will rate this experience 3.5/5 .
My family and I went on a Monday morning, and it wasn't overwhelmingly busy. Had a cool edgy but modern feel. Everything on the menu seemed appetizing (making my decision quite difficult) but I ended up getting the eggs with goat milk cheese and loved it.
I'm with all those saying this place is decent, but definitely overrated. But that may just be the spoiled New Yorker in me talking.While Montreal does a lot of things right, a hipster-like brunch is not one of them.Before you jump down my throat for using the "H word," look around this place and pick out even one person who doesn't seem to take themselves waaay too seriously. Even our server barely cracked a smile the entire time we saw him buzzing around the restaurant. And the communal tables? Come on, hipster galore.As for the food, it's great if you LOVELOVELOVE eggs - because they have about 20 different varieties of egg dishes - but pretty meh for everything else. During my most recent visit, I got the overpriced bagel with smoked salmon with a couple of fruit slices which were clearly sitting out for a while before being put on my plate.The first time I came I got the Cartet brunch with an assortment of breads and pastries, which was, once again, just a-okay. Nothing to write home about.
Great spot and seems to be popular with the locals. Really good coffee bar and brunch menu.
A beautiful Sunday morning in the city always lends itself to a nice brunch. A couple of Sundays ago, the family was downtown for the weekend so it was the perfect opportunity to head down to old Montreal for a nice family meal. For the occasion, we decided to try out Le Cartet, a place that I had heard many good things about but hadn't had the chance to try yet. This restaurant and boutique offers breakfast and lunch as well as a takeout menu for the many workers in the area during weekdays . On the weekend, the focus switches to brunch. We arrived for the beginning of the brunch service and were able to grab one of the last tables in the back so thankfully we didn't wait long. Given the lineup that was present on our exit an hour later, we made the right call to arrive early. The space is a perfect morning spot - tons of natural lighting, plain white walls and high ceilings. It's a tight fit with everyone cramming in for brunch but still comfortable. The brunch menu at Le Cartet is a combination of classic brunch dishes with some extra twists. The first dish that we ordered was their Coupe Santé - Fresh fruit salad, greek yogourt, blueberries, ginger-honey organic granola and cashew nuts. Wherever they get their greek yogourt, my family would love to know because it was some of the best we've ever had. I love blueberries so that's the perfect option to pair with the yogurt and the granola was wonderful as well - a nice subtle hint of both honey and ginger. Mix everything together and you get a very nice yogurt parfait. The lightest option we tried and a hit for all of us.The second dish we got was the Brunch Cartet - Scrambled eggs with mesclun salad, ham croissant, goat cheese and a sweet potato salmon cake. This was the most unconventional plate we ordered. I could take or leave the salad - it was good but rather unremarkable. The scrambled eggs were very done as one would hope from a breakfast/brunch place. The croissant was fresh and flaky, the ham was solid and the goat cheese was a nice creamy rich touch to a otherwise light plate. The real star in the end however was the salmon cake - nice crunch on the outside while keeping a flaky context inside. I would have loved that element to be more plentiful compared to the rest but a solid dish nevertheless.The final dish was le Brunch des Cantons - Scrambled eggs with country ham, sausage, bacon, baked beans, toast and roasted herb potatoes cooked in duck fat. This dish was completely in my wheelhouse which makes the fact that I didn't order it all the more shocking! Great items here - all the meats were delicious and I am always a sucker with anything cooked in duck fat.Each of these dishes came with an amuse-gueule to enjoy before the meal however we didn't get them during our meal! Our waiter, realizing his mistake, gave us a mini-bag of them on our exit - sucre a la creme. Deliciously rich and sweet - this ended up being a nice way to end the meal rather than start it.Le Cartet was a solid brunch experience - all the dishes were well executed and the service was quick and to the point. Its location makes me a perfect starting point for a nice afternoon in Old Montreal. Whether or not I would stand in line to eat there however is a different question all together. In the end, I would easily recommend you give them a shot -  however arrive early otherwise your day in the old port will become a quick afternoon stroll. Cheers!
LOVED our brunch here.  Brought our baby in a stroller, and while it took a little while to get a table, the staff were welcoming and accommodating.  My brunch was delicious - ham & cheese on a croissant with salad and fruit.  Hubby got the Atlantic platter, and raved about it.  Oh and my lattlé bowl was a GREAT cup of coffee.  Great service.  Bright, sunny and trendy decor.  Fun vibe.  (Note that many of the tables are communal, but with the upbeat and busy vibe, you don't even hear the people beside you).
The locals love Le Cartet, and you should, too.Be forewarned: You'd better have an appetite before choosing the 17$ brunch selection, and I suggest you do so. If you have grabbed a bite at the hotel or something beforehand, order something smaller and come back another day, because, straight-up, this is a fantastic place to eat!
I really liked this spot - it reminded me of a modern café in the financial districts of San Francisco or New York - modern and a bit minimalist with tall ceilings and a somewhat industrial look.We were here for brunch and I thought it was excellent - I had eggs with goat cheese and while it sounds simple, it was such great quality and cooked so well, that it was something special.  We also had some good hot chocolate.  There is a section of prepared food and everything looked great - we took home some pastries and everything was very good.
Le Cartet is pricey but has excellent food and sweet goodies. If you're looking to pick up a gift or grab lunch to go, it's a good place to check out. It's a nice place for a business lunch or for a coffee break while in Old Montreal.
Amazing food and wonderful service! We got there right before it opened and we're lucky to get an outside table. It was a gorgeous day and the breakfast was simply incredible. My husband was not very thrilled with his Salmon cake but other than that scarfed the rest of his and mine down!
If you want to have breakfast in Montreal, you can't go wrong with Le Cartet. Great atmosphere, great food, fast service, even though on a Saturday or Sunday you might have to stand in line. I had to stand in line for about 10 min in +7 weather, but it was worth it. If you look at the pictures I uploaded to Yelp, you'll see that Le Cartet chefs care about presentation and good food. Their yogurt with blueberries and muesli was REALLY tasty. I highly recommend it. Le Cartet is not cheap. You'll pay $17+tax for an average plate, but it's money well spent IMHO. I will surely be back next time I'm in Montreal.
The food was incredible and the place itself is just fantastic, perfect for a sunday brunch if you like a trendy, yet casual ambiance. It has a bit NYC market/bistro charm.
We visited from the States.  Got up late but they were still serving quiche.  Best. Quiche. Ever.  Damn....and the mimosas!!!!
Very trendy coffee place on McGill.Love to go back With friends- its so beautiful inside !!!There is the little shop at the entrane With fine and unique products.You Can even take out prépared meals . they all look good !Coffee is de licousBreakfast are a sure bet!They have big tables for group.
I went here for lunch the other day. I had the salmon sandwhich and my boyfriend had the ham and cheese on a baguette. One word- amazing. Fish tasted fresh and portions just right. We had the pecan whiskey pie to top things off...and wow....heaven on earth. Our waitress was friendly and I got to practice my french with her. Its been two days and I can't stop thinking about the pie!
Excellent and unique brunch. Good ambience. Lines could be little long but they move it fast. We had the salmon and the ham croissant.
Le Cartet is a great spot for a weekend brunch in Old Montreal. The ambiance is so cheerful and the staff is very friendly. Be sure to order something from the brunch menu. It's a bit more expensive than your typical breakfast place, but the brunch menu includes free coffee and orange juice refills. You also get a little amuse-bouche before your meal. Plus the portion of the food is enormous!
The food is good, limited choice! Not a traditional breakfast place! Line up, busy and overpriced! Won't be going back, but just because it's not my kind of breakfast place and not worth the price!
I love this cute resto/boutique! I stayed across the street at St. Paul and it was such a nice quick walk to a place that has so much to offer. I had Scrambled Eggs with Toast (scrambled with goat cheese), side of fresh delicious fruit and potatoes and Maple latte. It was the perfect start to my day! I also came back two days later to buy some goodies to take back to my office-mates. The cashier suggested Caramel Pecans and Maple Covered Almonds -- both of them are yummy, not so indulgent yet so "uniquely Montreal."
I LOVE the brunch here! I've been coming here every other weekend since moving to Montreal! The service is quick and friendly. The seating is casual, and they have a huge variety of chocolates at the front to purchase! I work nearby so I come here often to grab lunch, or a chocolate snack. The brunch is only served on weekends! I highly recommend it. I would come again and again!Food -  Amazing!Service - Friendly and quickAmbiance - CasualWorth the money - Yes!
Was on vacay and it was so good we are here twice! The little shop in the restaurant has amazing treats including gluten free baked goods. Breakfast was incredible with gluten free choices and delicious coffee.
J'adore le cartet! My boyfriend found this incredible brunch spot, and it's since become our favorite in le Vieuxport! Le petit dejuner est tres delicieux et l'ambiance est amical.
My traveling group enjoyed breakfast here two mornings of our recent long weekend excursion.  Thanks to some preliminary Yelp research, we knew we had to get there early to avoid a wait, so we arrived between 9:30 and 10:00 both Saturday and Monday morning and got right in.  I wouldn't recommend this place for a large party, but we were lucky and snagged one of the long bench tables for our party of 8.  I really liked the modern vibe here, kind of a chic breakfast loft is how I'd describe it.  Service was polite and efficient with minimal banter.  Given the line out the door as we left, I gather they're very interested in turning tables over at a reasonable rate.  The food was quite good and felt way more wholesome than a Denny's or an IHOP.  On my first visit I had the coupe santé with the ginger granola and blueberry yogurt.  I don't know quite how to describe it, but the yogurt was incredible.  It had the consistency of Greek yogurt, but tasted creamier and less tart than the Chobani in my fridge.  The fruit alongside was amazingly fresh and despite my reservations, there was more than enough food to keep me fueled until mid-afternoon.  My second visit I sampled the torta mixta.  This Portuguese sandwich was not exactly teeming with French-Canadian influence, but I was so intrigued by the addition of mustard to the egg sandwich.  I've never had it that way and I must say, it works.  C'est magnifique!     A short walk from our hotel, Le Cartet was a great way to start our mornings in my favorite weekend getaway city.  I imagine there will be at least one repeat visit on our next trip up.
I came here after reading the good Yelp reviews. It's a pretty solid place, but the long line on weekends for brunch is somewhat off-putting. We figured it must be good if this many people are lining up, so we stuck it out for ~30-45 mins. despite being really hungry! I can't say they manage the line that well. There's a long line and it took me a while to figure out that it was for the coffee/tea counter (you can get a drink to sip on while  you wait). I was confused if it was only a take-out line or not. I stood there for a while, then someone took my name down and added it to a list. We had to awkwardly hang around the boutique section at the front of the restaurant while we waited (mmm, everything there looks so tasty... fancy olive oils, Kusmi teas, pre-made salads...). I can see why it's popular -- the decor is very understated-chic and the communal tables are nice. Food-wise, I expected more and price-wise, I wouldn't say they offer great value (brunch plates $15-16). I had the brunch Cartet which was huge. I liked that it came with a big salad. The croissant with ham and goat cheese was yummy. The scrambled eggs were kind of cold and the salmon was just ok. My DC's eggs benny looked overcooked; the yolk wasn't drippy like it's supposed to be. Definitely get a mimosa though. That's something they do well here and after the long wait, you'll need one.
It's a charming place with great service, but food quality wasnt memorable, especially given the price. We ordered the brunch sucre and brunch de l'Atlantique. It comes with a glass of Fresh orange juice and a some pieces of chocolate bread. I though the food was very salty if savory and not flavorful enough for the sweet.
My boyfriend and I came here for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. We waited on line for a total of maybe 10-15 minutes and was luckily seated at a two-person table. You WILL get seated next to strangers at a larger table (especially during busy hours), so for those who find settings like that uncomfortable, I would recommend you tell the hostess first thing. I can't exactly remember the brunch combo I ordered but it consisted of a bagel with CC and smoked salmon, some scrambled eggs, a sweet potato pie cake, along with fruit on the side. The combo plates are very big and are served in appropriate portions so you leave feeling satisfied in all aspects. My boyfriend ordered the crepes and really enjoyed the little pastry served with applesauce and blueberries. Brunch also comes with unlimited coffee and fresh orange juice. Overall, a great brunch experience and highly recommended.
Went here for brunch during my stay in Montreal and was very pleased. It had the perfect ambience for a brunch spot and the food was tasty! Prices were reasonable. Got one of the brunch meals and was pleasantly surprised by the portion size. Although it was a bit much for me, it was a wonderful size for my boyfriend. We topped our brunch off with a lovely dessert, a tasty croissant with chocolate inside. Loved it! Also, the mimosa (which was an add on) was nice and potent, just the way I like it.
I just ate the chocolate cherry muffin and it was the best muffin I ever had
This was the very first restaurant I came to upon my arrival in beautiful Montreal. My sister said it was a good breakfast spot and she was right! I ordered a BLT bagel and my sister had the Brunch Sante dish (which came with granola & yogurt, fruit, poaches eggs, cheese, etc.). I really enjoyed this quaint little café; it was cozy, had great service, and a wonderful ambiance that made me feel like I was in a different country... oh wait, I was! Anyway, this was a great place to kick off my vacation and get breakfast. If I lived nearby, I can totally see myself coming here regularly.
I had a great Sunday breakfast/brunch here. I ate the Brunch des Cantons which is eggs, country ham, bacon, sausage, baked beans and potatoes served in a cast iron skillet. It was definitely hearty but exactly what I needed after a late night and every component of the dish tasted awesome. Turns out it was the only meal I needed for the entire day.
I wish I found this place the first morning we arrived in Montreal because I would have been there everyday for breakfast. Cons: -Pricey for breakfast. There was 3 of us and with one coffee and one breakfast platter each we payed over $90 with tax and tip. -Gets crowded fast. We luckily came a little early and didn't wait longer then 10 mins (bonus: outside tables are just first come and taketh- you don't have to wait on the line)Pros: -The most delicious breakfast I have had in a very very very long time. I ordered a salmon bagel plate. It's came with a bagel with lox and cream cheese with onions and these deliciously huge capers. The bagel was thin, crunchy on the outside and nice and fluffy on the inside. It also came with a salmon biscuit (baked salmon and some flour) which was flavorful and not too dry. There was also a side omelet which I just couldn't fit in my stomach. And some fruit and small salad. My boyfriend had a delicious breakfast meat platter with fried beans served on cast iron. Came with some delicious toast too. I woke up today dreaming about another breakfast like this. It's a most to visit.
Excellent service, OK food, generic rustic-hipster décor. On a Sunday, the place was packed and the temperature inside was approximately 7,000 degrees. Go there for the people-watching and the attentive service and the proximity to Old Port tourist attractions.
Long wait for food and not very accommodating for strollers but the food was good and the shop in front was nice to browse while waiting
A lively atmosphere with a great vibe.Baked goods as well as some confectionery was sold in front.A bright and modern room greets diners on a mixed of private smaller tables and long communal tables.We got got lucky and was sat right away.Those who came in a few second after us had to wait for around 15 - 30 minutes.I ordered their signature dish, which was served in a skillet with beans, sausage, bacon, ham, potato and eggs.  I was told this was their most popular dish and had high expectation.  Sadly, I was a bit let down.  While presentation was unique, it was nothing special and quite pricy for what you get at $17.  My companions ordered the crepe and the blueberry french toast - and were very happy with their choices.Service was very professional and efficient.I would come again, but order some different next time.
Came here originally for breakfast but unfortunately it ended by 11am. I got there at 1111am so I had to wait around 10-15 minutes for the kitchen to prepare their brunch/lunch menu. I ordered the vegetarian panini with their soup of the day. It was delicious and well presented. Definitely one of my favourite brunch places in Montreal. Located in a lovely area as well. Staff are really friendly and hospitable.
Wonderful breakfast!  I enjoyed the goat cheese scrambled eggs on toast.  The eggs were light/fluffy and the goat cheese had a great flavor.  The decor of the restaurant is rustic modern and had a warm feel.  It was also nice that there was free wifi and they serve illy coffee.
Cute place. Solid breakfast. Staples, nothing too fancy. The staff is nice, and the little shop in the front is a nice place to pick up some French food-based gifts. My favorite part was the espresso & the great chocolate-pistachio croissant!
Loved brunch here! Not alot of selection but you sure get the most for your buck!I got the smoked salmon dish. All was great except for the sweet potato salmon ball. Staff were very friendly. Would definitely recommend.
Breakfast in Montreal!! the lineup is out the door and the wait was about 45 min. after a big mug of latte, i feel a bit more relaxed and less grumpy. For four people, we ordered the crepe meal, salmon meal, and a egg benedict meal ( the actual names are in french, i have no idea) and that was quite enough. Our waitress was helpful and she was happy to help us out. Everything was good except the salmon cake and salmon egg - it was a bit fishy, did it come from a can? I wasn't liking my fishy smelly egg thingy in the kremlin - all the other foods were good. Cute decor, great crowd, packed restaurant. I really enjoyed  my meal here. I thought I'd have enough stomach space for a croissant in the end.. all the baked goods look so amazing at the entrance. Maybe i'll come again in the future just for the baked goods!free wi-fi, that's always a bonus!
I have to confess to eating the same breakfast three days in a row. Why mess with a good thing? Two scrambled eggs with mushrooms and spicy sausage. very friendly staff and very comfortable space. Will come again when next in town
Wow!  My wife and I had an amazing breakfast 2 days in a row here.  I can't say enough about this place, the food, the staff, I can go on and on.  Despite the line just outside the door, it moves pretty fast.  And it's worth the wait if at all.
My favorite brunch in Montreal.  There is an Atlantic plate of different salmon dishes that is up there among the best brunch that I have ever had.  Featuring a salmon cake, smoked salmon eggs, smoked salmon on a Montreal bagel and an amazing salad, I salivate thinking about it.  That said, I clearly love salmon and have never seen so many salmon options on one plate.  That might not be for everyone.The service is efficient and the space is inviting.  Despite being a large group, we weren't in any way hurried.  Love it.
The food there is amazing and they have something new as daily special everyday. I had their pasta special for lunch today.
It was a bit of a walk from the nearest Metro station, but so worth it. So so so delicious. Probably the best meal I had in Montreal.We came here for brunch on a Saturday morning, around 10. There were quite a few empty tables, but by the time we left the place was full and there was a line for seating. I ordered the Brunch Toscan. Basically egg's Benedict, with a side of potatoes, assorted fresh fruit, along with some really delicious coffee and freshly squeezed OJ. The egg's Benedict was bomb, and not overly salty and the sauce was rich, but not overpowering. The fresh fruit wasn't the normal crappy fruit you get at most places. Stawberry, grapefruit, orange, and pineapple. Yummy. All that food and drink for 16 bucks, not a bad deal at all. I was stuffed by the end of the meal and like a true brunch, couldn't even think about eating for many hours after. I also got to eat some of their fresh baguette and croissant. Both were excellent! This is a MUST on every trip to Montreal, and I will definitely be back when I return.
Nice place, clean, cozy and inviting environment. Suits all ages (They have crayons and menu for kids).The staff is nice and knowledgable.The prices are decent.But I would say the food is decent, not that extraordinary or special..They also have a little shop to buy teas or chocolates which is nice! (although pricey)Tip: Come early (9am) on Saturday and get a great brunch! It gets busy afterwards..
I was expecting more from Le Cartet given their reviews.  We arrived at 11:30am on a Sunday and waited 45 minutes for a table.  My iced coffee consisted of hot coffee pour over ice.  The ice melted after two sips.  I ordered the 2-minute egg with ham and cheese and toast.  The egg and the toast were good.  The ham and cheese were disappointing.  They looked like they were from a supermarket deli.  I would not recommend this restaurant.  It was not worth the wait.
AMAZING BRUNCH!!!great portion size, good service, roomy seatings & good atmosphere!it's located a few blocks from the notre-dame bascilica, so we had a great walk after the brunch too..
Despite there being lots of people waiting, we got a seat outside with the dog within about 5 minutes, both times we went here. The big fry-up was incredible, and the healthy breakfast was delicious. The service was fast and friendly, and they even brought out a bowl of water for the dog.
This place was spectacular. Stopped in after walking around the city, and my initial impression was that it's a beautiful place! The service is really great and on point, and the food is the best I've ever had for breakfast (even compared to many European restaurants, cafes, and bistros). The price was fine for what we ordered, and the coffee was very good. I recommend a trip to Montreal just to go here.
The brunch here is really killin the game. You dont get it like that here in the states. It was some serious eats. The eggs and meats are done right and the juices are super fresh, like squeezed to order type ish. If you are in Montreal and want a good brunch spot, check this place out. .The community table was cool and everyone was friendly there. They also have alot of stuff you can buy to take back home
Had their salmon tartar plate! Nice vibe and little boutique products right at the entrance! :)
Le Cartet is a mix of a chic boutique and a lively brunch house. Long tables that are shared amongst customers take up majority of the space. At the front of the business, one can find savory quick-meals or snacks to go, like sandwiches, salads, chocolates, muffins, smoothies, and so much more.Peak hours can cause a long and tedious wait, but it is so worth it, especially when you get to feast away on potato wedges fried in duck fat aside creative and unique variations of eggs, french toast, bacon, and whatnot. Moreover, the coffee is freshly brewed, and the juice is squeezed on the spot. A local hotspot that is not overpriced, but reasonable in regards to its location in Old Montreal. Definitely worth the visit!
Outstanding Sunday brunch.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  Delectable meats, farm fresh eggs and garden vegetables.  Friendly service.  Fantastic ambiance.
As an infrequent visitor of Montreal, Le Cartet is one of my favorite restaurants for breakfast and brunch. Such wonderful food that I think is healthful but doesn't taste like health food.  Despite the bustling flow of people through the place, the staff remains enjoyable.  Love love love this place and wish we had one here in New York!
This is a very nice spot for brunch. With tables both separate and communal, they pack 'em in. The illy coffee is too bitter for my taste but the food was well done. As most spots in Old Montreal, it has a painted brick wall and industrial ceiling which didn't make it too noisy. But, I sat next to the wall which had an accumulation of crumbs on its ledge.
We met up with the boyfriend's mum and sister for a weekend in Montreal while his sister was at a conference and decided to try to find a good place to walk to for brunch in Old Montreal, near where we were staying. With the help of Yelp, I found Le Cartet.The space is long and thin, going way, way back. There is lots of space if you are coming with a bigger group, but it was pretty busy. If they take reservations (I'm not sure, the three of us walked in) it would be a good idea to make some for a larger group. You walk through a small market on your way in where you could grab pre-packaged sandwiches, salads and the like if you're in a hurryPart of what attracted us to this place was the really nice brunch options -  they're definitely unique. I really liked that you could order dishes that included a little bit of everything, perfect for someone like me who often has angst about what we're forgoing to order our meal. I had the Brunch Cartet, he had the Burnch Toscan and his mum had the Brunch de l'Atlantique. Everyone really enjoyed everything, though my scrambled eggs were cooked harder than I prefer and the croissant wasn't as flakey as you can sometimes get in Montreal, the variety made up for it. Go with an appetite, though, because all of these brunches are a lot of food!The fresh Illy coffee was also tasty and especially appreciated because it was a chilly morning, and I liked that coffee and fresh squeezed juice were included with brunch (or a mimosa! but none of us partook) It was a little pricey for breakfast, but not too bad for brunch (around $17 each) I'd definitely recommend this place for a nice brunch or breakfast in Old Montreal, which is an area that can be really hit and miss for food.
My wife and I were looking for a nice breakfast spot during our recent visit to Montreal.  Thank you Yelpers for recommending Le Cartet!  We liked it so much we went back again the next morning.  I had delicious croissant and toasted baguette with a soft-boiled egg and fruit.  The wife did even better with toasted banana/coconut bread and greek yogurt with fresh blueberries.  (I had that the second day.  Win!)It's not so impressive from the street, but inside the decor is lovely - clean and simple.  Service was very friendly.After a week of eating in restaurants full of tourists, it was nice to be in a place favored by the locals.  Most of the clientele had their bags and briefcases and were clearly on their way to work.  Wish I had a place like this near my house!
This fantastic place is located a short walk from the Old Montreal center. I had a beautiful brunch platter that came with a buttery croissant with goat cheese and ham, a fruit salad, green salad, salmon cake, cheese, fig, and scrambled eggs. Delicious mimosas too! The staff is warm and friendly. Excellent meal and service.
Amazing and authentic food served in a really appealing cast iron skillet still sizzling. There was no wait for us and the service was great. I also highly recommend the maple croissants.
delicious brunch. I had the poached eggs with spinach, ham on an english muffin. It was good. pretty atmosphere and good service.
I wanted to love this place, and based on all the positive Yelp reviews I thought I would, but it was mostly just average. We got there for brunch around 10:30am on a Sunday morning and the line was already well out the door for a table, so I would suggest getting there early. We got lucky and since all the people ahead of us were parties of 3 or more and we were just 2, we got to jump the line and only waited about 15 min total. I had the scrambled egg with asparagus and chedder on toast, with fruit and potatoes. The egg was actually pretty good, but the toast was a bit burned and too crispy. The fruit was fresh and enjoyable. As for the potatoes, I generally love potatoes made any way, but I didnt like them at all and only ate a bite. Im not sure why you would cook potatoes in duck fat, because it mostly left them just tasting weird and too sweet (to me, Im aware other reviewers loved them).  Overall it was an acceptable breakfast, but I wouldnt go back. Breakfast is usually my favorite meal, and I love breakfast foods, but there just wasnt anything here to make me want to come back.
Pretty good but clearly overrated.
Get there before 11 or else be prepared to wait.  We got there at around 10:15 and by the time we left there was a long line. Staff was very nice and very observant. Always making sure we were satisfied.  Got the brunch sucre and it was so tasty. A lot of food though so if you're not hungry, you might want to go with something smaller.  My friend had the croissant and he likes it as well.  Also a little pastry shop if you want just a quick bite to munch.  Good food and nice breakfast place. Thumbs up!
Having worked for a year in the Cité Multimédia, Le Cartet was a go-to for lunch time when I had to grab a take-out. I especially love their 'epicerie' style section, where they offer a nice variety of chips and snacks, imported European products (that wasabi mayonnaise I found there, amazing!), and a nice take-out dishes that you could grab and bring back to your office. The downside of it? It can get pricey, and it's crowdy since it's sooooo popular during lunchtime.
I'm a big fan of the brunch here! dejeuner santé is yum!
A-ok...
Awesome coffees, lots of options. The orange black moka is not to be missed. The bowls of latte are decadent. The breakfast is heart but not heavy. Wanted to try tge almond croissant and their french toast but we missed it, thats what you get for showing up for a late breakfast. Next time we will come earlier. Definitely recommend this as the breakfast place to be.
Excellent brunch/breakfast.  This place offers a variety a breakfast dishes that taste amazing.  I am not a breakfast fan, but this place changed my mind
Long wait at 11:45 am on a Saturday, accompanied by expensive (yet terrible) food. Would never come back. Not sure why so many people are willing to wait. For god's sake, walk 10-15 minutes to Olive et Gourmando instead. Worst brunch I've had in a long time. Why is this so highly rated on Yelp!?!
My wife and I went to La Caret when we visited Montreal for our anniversary last weekend.I'm seriously thinking about driving 6 hours back there this weekend just for more breakfast. It's that good.I was a little nervous about the communal seating - I'm a big dude and not always the most social fellow, so I thought I'd find being packed in next to total strangers to be very uncomfortable. It turned out to be fine. I think the fact that the people on either side of us were speaking French and we were speaking English helped it feel less weird. Plus, I had more room at this communal table than I usually have on the train or even in some restaurants where the "individual" tables are like six inches apart.The food was just fantastic. Seriously amazing. You know how when you're a kid if you say you love something someone says "If you love it so much, why don't you marry it?" Well I would marry this breakfast skillet, that's how much I love it. Which if the Republicans in my country are to be believed, will be legal about ten minutes after we recognize same sex marriage.
Great breakfast place with delicious coffees, juices, and breakfast specialties.  Croissants were flakey, hot breakfasts were yummy and service was friendly and fast.  On weekends will require a wait, but there is a charming shop up front with a selection of gourmet items from all over the world.  Nice ambiance with high ceilings and exposed brick walls.   Local crowd.
Located in old Montreal, long lineup, great atmosphere, small boutique for gourmet chocolates and teas. If you're looking for big dishes with greasy bacon and sausages, this is probably not the place for you. This resto is similar to Parisian bakeries, the croissant, baguettes and confitures- my kind of establishment. I got the brunch santé and my yogurt was soooo good, creamier French style yogurt, love it. The artisanal breads were good and overall this place is a winner for me, I like simple breakfast with great coffee.
Went there for brunch with friends on Saturday. I ordered the Brunch Toscan and I have never had such a stale english muffin before. The bottom was so stale that it was difficult to cut. I was super hungry, and I've used a saw before so I managed. But it was unpleasant and didn't taste very good.I left some behind to show to the waiter who seemed to just shrug it off like who cares. Super bizzare. Even McDonalds would have apologized or something. Definitely odd to have such poor quality control.However my friends ordered different stuff and seemed to enjoy it. So maybe some things are good here.Oh and the amuse bouche to start was great, so some points for that.
Waiting in line at customs got you down? Has it already been an hour and a half? Getting hungry? Le Cartet is just around the corner. Lovely, well-designed spot. I can't speak to the sit-down part of this joint, but the prepared foods were just what I needed. I bolted right in and out at lunchtime on a Monday. Grabbed a sandwich, H2O + CO2 and three madeleines. $14. Delicious and took the edge off my wait. The Madeleines were particularly light and fresh. They also had freshly made Pasteis de Nata, which was a cool surprise. I love the Portuguese influence in Montreal. Coffee is OK. Really ought to be better, tho. Too automatic, not enough craft.Rating Scale:1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.  2 Star: With so many great places to choose from, why risk this one?3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch.4 Star: I go here regularly if financially and/or calorically feasible.5 Star: I look forward to taking my wife or friends here.
Overrated..Atmosphere: Too many seats so they can pack as many people in to make the most $ in the least amount of time. It's not comfortable and it's not cool to eat elbow-to-elbow with strangers, especially when one person is coughing continuously and it's so hot in the room you know it's a hotbed of colds and flu waiting to happen. It's a condo decor-as-restaurant-themed location that's so over and tired; but if the diners are impressed, who cares, because they don't know any better.Food: For lunch, quiche (too many rosemary sprigs), and pulled pork sandwich (cinnamon, cumin, and clove?) and leek soup with hard pieces of stalk.Service: When the server removed our plates that were more than 2/3 full, there was no question about whether we liked our dishes. There are better places in the neighbourhood by far.
I found out about this place when reading a 3 year-old NYTimes 36 Hours in Montreal article.  It was near our hotel and gave it a shot.  We arrived at 10am for Sunday brunch and were fortunate that the wait was modest (10min).  When we left, the line was out the door.First, the dining space is very cool.  It is clean, airy, and has a loft like feel.  They really did a good job in optimizing a slightly narrow and long space.  My wife ordered the Brunch Sante and very much enjoyed it.  I got the De L'Atlantique (basically salmon three ways).  Overall, mine was pretty good although I didn't care for the salmon in the sweet potato cake.  Also, I did not think the fruit and salad were fresh.  Finally, in a city with awesome croissants, the one I had from here was easily the worst I've had.  It was stale and uninspired.Despite some misses with the food, I definitely would come back and would recommend it to others.  The overall experience was very pleasant which was facilitated by the great staff and the vibrant atmosphere.  Plus the free refills on brewed Illy Coffee that comes with the brunch orders (the main initial draw for me) were terrific.
I won't lie the 2 of us considered other brunch options when we walked in at about 11am on a Sunday morning - there were dozens of people waiting to be seated! However, the server quickly took our name and we only waited about 15mins to be seated. Our wait gave us time to peruse the grocery store section - the shelves were filled with a plethora of goodies; olive oils, chocolates, gourmet pastas, preserves.... made me wish I was a better cook!We loved the restaurant with its open kitchen, high ceiling and bright airy feel. The little decor details, fall flowers and mini pumpkins, were a nice touch. We were seated at the communal tables - you have just enough space to eat comfortably and its great if you enjoy a little eavesdropping like I do!Menu isn't extensive but well thought out - there's bound to be a choice for you whether you're feeling "sucré, salé or santé"Their specials (all about $15) come with coffee and juice (or a mimosa for a little extra!)Rather than bread, they brought us a few pieces of apple cake to start - delicious and a nice detail. I had the Brunch des Cantons - their version of the big breakfast - served in a cast iron pan. It had ham, sausage, bacon, scrambled eggs, beans, and potatoes, as well as a side plate of bread and fruit.  It was good and filling without being too heavy.Service was good - attentive but not overly so. The woman seated next us complained that her mimosa didn't have enough of a kick and was immediately brought a second, complimentary one. Would definitely reccomend for brunch.
I read the reviews and really wanted to try this place out. We sat on the patio and have to say that we really enjoyed the meal. The quality of the food was great. I had the Brunch L'atlantique which was a great blend of smoked salmon serviced in a variety of different ways. I enjoyed them all except for the salmon cake which was a variation of the classic crab cake. It was a bit too salty and maybe over-capered  for my taste but overall it was ok. My friend had the Brunch Sucre which was crepes, French toast and yoghurt with fruits. He liked his meal (being a real sweet tooth) and the portions were great. Best value was that fresh squeezed orange juice came with your brunch. Well worth finding this place and the only thing I'll remember for next time is to make sure to wait and try eating inside. It looked like a great place inside, even though we enjoyed sitting on the patio. It reminded me of places in Europe. Thanks for a great meal.  We'll be back!
A great place to eat-in, but A-OK for take out.  Since I do more take out than eat-in I give it a 3 star rating.  I don't know why the take out food can't be as great as their eat-in selection, which is so fantastic...
The brunch here was amazing. I got the ham and cheese croissant sandwich, but I wish I could have ordered everything. The tables are very close together so everyone's food around me looked amazing as well. The service was good and the server was very nice. I also thought the store was really cool, and wish I wold have bought some of the stuff (especially the chocolate)! My only complaint was that the mimosa was pretty much orange juice, but it was fresh squeezed so I guess that's okay.
What a cute and friendly little place!!  I loved the hustle and bustle of the brunch crowd.  The only thing that was a little confusing was getting a seat.  We put in our name on a list and what we do in Chicago is wait outside until they find us.  But you can see there's a queue so after like 20 mins I got in line and bingo! we were seated.  I don't know if it was timing or if we should have been in the line all this time.Its a little on the pricey side but one breakfast should be a splurge, right?  We all started w/ mimosas which were great but not for me.  I cannot stand pulp.  I know I'm a weirdo.  I'd rather have Tang than fresh squeezed.  It was too chunky for me but I'm sure everyone else loved it.  I had coffee which was very good.  I got an almond croissant to start/share.  It was amazing!!  We also wanted some cheese so we got the $8 plate which was all good stuff.  I had the goat cheese scramble on toast.  I was so homey and comforting!  They do not skimp on the cheese!  I would have loved more bread but the other diners had extra so no biggie.  They both got this meaty, beany,  cowboy skillet which must have been great.  For a good 10 mins none of us were talking!After we checked out the little store and bought some candies.  I spent a lot but they were all oh so good and I think...not available in Chicago.I'd seek this place out if I were in Montreal again.
I stumbled upon this place when I was in Montreal on vacation. A large group of my friends stumbled upon it, with no guidance from me, when THEY were in Montreal on vacation. Most recently, I convinced a group of colleagues to rush here for a quick pre-airport breakfast when I was in Montreal on business.The reactions are, without fail, unanimous declarations of adoration. What more do you need?
VIBE The decor at Le Cartet is awesome. Cool castor-esque light bulbs hang down from the ceilings. Cool cut outs of maps are on the wall and big pots of poinsettas are in the back. I can see it's a buzzy type of place for brunch/lunch. I came for lunch but where Le Cartet really misses out is on its service. I was not greeted. I was not asked normal things like: would you like something to drink? I had to ask for the specials. I ATE I had the salmon sandwich. It was a decent sandwich but I assumed I'd have slices of salmon as opposed to it being a creamy mishmash of a tuna melt. It was solid food but way overpriced with a measley green salad for $15. OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK Le meh. That said, I would come back if I'm directly in the area for ambiance or to buy something in the market. Otherwise, it's a bit on the edge of Old Montreal and out of the way for something that is ho-hum.
My two previous visits to Le Cartet during prior visits to Montreal were unsuccessful, as I always seemed to have a knack for arriving just as their kitchen was closing. I was excited to get there at 11am on a weekday to find the kitchen open, but my happiness was crested when I found out that only a limited menu was served in the time between breakfast and lunch. So, begrudgingly, I chose a goat cheese and vegetable frittata -- one of only two options available. Given that there were only two options, I thought I'd get some sort of half-assed meal, but I was totally wrong -- the frittata was awesome: fluffy, perfectly cooked, and served in an individual glazed cast iron ramekin (I'm a sucker for food in individual compartments). I also ordered orange juice, which was fresh-squeezed but not too pulpy.  On my way out, I grabbed some prepared food from the cold cases near the front of the shop to stock the fridge in my nearby rental. Delicious, and without the prefab food taste or feel you might get at other delis.  The best thing about my visit, however, was non-food related -- the cafe has this great artwork on the walls by an artist named James Kennedy (jameskennedy.ca), who uses hot rolled steel to produce these really interesting (and reasonably priced) pieces. My partner and I dug the art so much, we contacted the artist and purchased a piece. So, thanks to Le Cartet, I left with a happy tummy AND a very cool souvenir of my trip to this amazing city. :)
I LOVE this place. Every time I visit Montreal this is a must. I also hope that it never changes. For me, this is the perfect breakfast spot. Even if there is a line, it's worth it! Everything I've ever tried has been amazing. I'm fond of the savory skillet dishes (with a free orange juice and fresh bread), but also a big fan of the crepes. It's good if you go with multiple (that was you can share!). Go hungry, leave extremely satisfied.On the way out, don't forget to stop at the store and get some goodies to go. I opted for the Dolfin Lavender Chocolate bar. YUM!Please open a branch in Brooklyn, NY. Pretty please?
Buyer beware!!I will not be back...not because the food was bad, but because I am too frugal.  I ordered granola with soy milk (because I am lactose intolerant and couldn't do the yogurt) and fruit dish plus coffee.  It cost about $14.  I had to get another breakfast beacuse it wasn't enough food.  So, it was tasty, but NOT FILLING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I had half a cup of granola at that!  They also charged me $0.75 more for a tiny thing of soy milk even though the yogurt is more expensive.  Go figure and go broke.Potatoes are cooked in duck fat.  Total bill was $40 for 2 of us.
Located on a broad yet quiet stretch of McGill near the Old City, Le Cartet looks like jumps straight out of the pages of a travel guide.  It's a big lofty space with crafty art pieces hanging on white brick walls, with lamps hanging down from the ceiling.  Diners are packed close together at small tables or at one of the larger communal ones.  With a small market boutique in the front and the restaurant operation in the back, it practically screams twee, but the food is good and the service is quick.After waiting for 20-30 minutes to sit down, I ordered the Atlantic breakfast platter, while the BF opted for the Sweet.  Both of our plates included coffee (and a mimosa for a few bucks more), as well as an avalanche of food.  My dish included scrambled eggs with smoked salmon, half a bagel dressed with lox, cream cheese, onions, and capers, a mesclun salad, fruit, and a salmon croquette, and it was more than enough.  Everything tasted really good on the whole, although the croquette was a bit dry and crusty.  His dish included crepes, french toast, fruit, and yogurt with granola.  The crepes were very good; not too sweet but just the right amount.  The french toast was not nearly as tender as I normally like (tasted a bit dry), but the subtle addition of the nuts, as well as the applesauce, added a bit of complexity.The menu is varied enough without being overwhelming, and the vibe is very mixed.  There are young people, old people, families, couples, and singles.  Considering what we ordered, the prices are pretty reasonable.  My only complaints would be the lack space available for people to wait for tables, as well as eating in.  It also may be a bit noisy if you're trying to carry on a conversation.  But otherwise, this is a perfectly fine brunch spot with good food and a great atmosphere/scene.
I was visiting Montreal and looking for a new brunch place when Le Cartert came up in conversation. While the location in old port is a bit touristy, don't let it full you this place is great. Service and atmosphere were both good. Brunch options on the sweet and savoury side were plentiful and the salmon brunch was incredible! It came with naturally a bagle and lox, fruit, perfectly fluffy scrambled eggs with salmon and some salad. topped up with a latte bowl for a winning brunch!Surprisingly reservations were not needed.
Great breakfast even though the line was 25 minutes long at 10 AM.  They have a great little store selling food goods like chocolate and foie gras among many other delectables.  Great service, too.
Great brunch in Old Port.Most places in Old Port are either overrun with tourists or overpriced. Le Cartet is neither. The wait can be a little long for brunch, but it is worth it.$15 for for a cast iron skillet filled with meaty deliciousness. Also decent vegetarian and pescatarian options.Craft beer too.
Lately le Cartet has become my regular breakfast spot. I enjoy the communal table seating and the interesting art found on the walls.The food isn't half bad either, the atlantique brunch and the soft boiled eggs are my favorite toped off with a cafe au lait in a bowl. Everything at le Cartet is good I've never heard anyone complain about the food.The service on the other hand can be hit or miss, if one of the waiters friends happens to drop in for a coffee you could find yourself waiting for them to finish the conversation before they come take your order. All in all Le Cartet is very nice place with good food and OK service, just remember this is old Montreal so the prices are old Montreal prices a little expensive.
Came on a Saturday morning at 9:30am and we were seated immediately, service was very nice.  I greatly enjoyed my Brunch Des Cantons, perfectly cooked beans and various pork.  My fiance liked her Brunch Sucre, but wasn't blown away by it.  Solid Coffee and OJ included with brunch.  All in all a very pleasant experience.
I found this gem on my Yelp App while searching "great breakfast spots".  I had every intention of waking up at 8 am the next day, doing my hair (just enough to look cool, but not trying too hard) and heading to Le Cartet for breakfast on a Friday.  Well, I was jet lagged and  woke up at 10:30, half did my hair and rushed down Rue McGill to try to catch breakfast, but I was too late, I was handed the lunch menu -- Boo!  I wanted to try to fit in with all the well dressed staff and patrons, so I pretended to understand the French menu and ordered what I thought was a goat cheese, almond and date salad.  Well, what I got was a warm pate of goat cheese, with almonds and dates in it served over lettuce and a few pieces of crostini.  I was confused, but kept up my "I'm a local and totally expected this" act.  I was pleasantly surprised with my selection!  So much so, that I came back for brunch the next day and had the Brunch Sucre.  It was definitely a carb and sugar overload, but worth it!  Capuccinos were small but tasty.  Each time I came here I spent around $20 CAN.
Went here for breakfast twice during a 2 day stay in Montreal. The food was absolutely fantastic and the ingredients were very fresh. Everything was arranged on the plate with many different components each adding their own flavor and contribution to the overall meal. I would definitely go to this place again if I happen to find myself in this great city.
Lovely little front counter mini epicerie area with amazing muffins, bottled smoothies and other drinks, excellent coffee to go. But really if you have time and don't mind spending a little more, sit down in the calm, bright restaurant and enjoy the excellent brunch specials on the chalkboard.
Wonderful lunch spot in the Vieux Montreal district. The quality of the food is excellent, the service was very sweet and attentive. I think a lot of business locals come here, and I can see why. We really enjoyed our lunch at Le Cartet. I would recommend !
Great brunch spot! I love the vibe. It's a cross between family friendly and urban sheek. I had the goat cheese scrambled eggs with thick cut bacon and fresh fruit. It was wonderful!!!
When I was in Montreal at the beginning of August in 2012 my boyfriend and I were determined to try a couple of places out of the Wallpaper* City Guide for Montreal. The one place we were able to check out was a breakfast place called Le Cartet. I wish we knew ahead of time how great it was going to be or we wouldn't have left it to the last day. First of all the interior was amazing- it was clean, simple, with a touch of sophisticated design. Most importantly, the food was to die for. I had the brunch des cantons ($15.35) which included scrambled eggs with sausage and bacon, potatoes roasted in duck fat and herbs, fried beans, and country bread. Breakfast also came with a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice. The whole meal was just divine (as the service was also fantastic).
Delicious.  Variety.  Well prepared and presented.  From the light to the massive the breakfasts are plenty satisfying.  Love the space too - individual as well as long shared tables and the high ceilings make for a pleasant time.
A great brunch spot!  I was skeptical of any restaurant in the old port area because it's just overrun with tourists (myself included), but I was quite impressed by my meal here... the highlight of which was a slice of thick grain bread, toasted and served with an apple puree spread and topped with blueberries.  It was just a part of the crepe dish, but blew away the main course altogether.  This will be my brunch spot for future Montreal visits.
Loved this spot, very charming and great food! A delight all the way through:)
The service ruined what could have been an average experience.  Our waiter did not pay attention to us, serving others first.  We ordered several dishes such as the Brunch Atlantic, Quiche and Salmon Cakes. They were average at best and nothing memorable. Further our orders were mistaken and drink orders delayed. I hope it was just an anomaly.  Be prepared to wait.
Completely Amazing is all I have to say!  had Sunday brunch there yesterday with my wife and 3 friends on the recommendation of the concierge at Hotel Gault.  Atmosphere at Le Cartet had us on entry (hard to do with 4 young hip architects from Toronto in the group).  Service was superb and the food...sublime!    Arrived at 10am which is early for Montrealer's and found it already packed.  A 5 minute wait landed this party of five at one of the long communal tables.  Who knew they opened at 9am on Sundays?From a traditional Farmers Breakfast style to the healthy fruit and granola options, each one is served fresh and with a little panache!Their little front shop had lots of grab-n-go fare as well as the most amazing assortment of chocolates!  I think we spent more in the store than on lunch!
Pre-made salads and sandwiches for take-away on pick-up-and-get-back-to-work lunches in the front, and a combo of small two top tables and long communal tables in the back -- Le Cartet appeals to many. I've spent a decent amount of time at Le Cartet. It's a naturally-lit, airy, above street space, where solo business guys on their laptops nestle up next to brunching felines on one side and a young family with a highchair on the other.Service can run at a snail's pace. Attempt to catch the server's eye or get ready to wait a while for an order to be taken or the bill to arrive. Coffees are fresh, juices are fresher. The ham and eggs breakfast is okay - a couple of pieces of thinly sliced salty ham and eggs scrambled, boiled or poached. But what makes it worth it? The duck fat fried potato wedges. They're a show stopper. I'd come back just for those!
The Cartet is one of my favorite spot in Montreal, I simply love it! There is a large selection of prepared meals if you're in a hurry. Try the niçoise salad, the salmon tartare or one of their sandwiches to go. They also serve brunch during the weekend, which is a must try. Arrive early if you want to avoid the wait and have the scrambled eggs with cheddar and asparagus or the brunch Cartet with a mimosa. The decor is beautiful, the ambiance is great and the food is amazing!
Perhaps having had a decent amount of breakfasts, I don't understand the hype about this place. It's not terrible, but at best, it's average (slightly better than average on a few items such as their baked beans, salmon cake, and smoked salmon bagel). The eggs were either too dry or extraordinarily soggy (waterlogged), while the toast consistently came out burnt (almost to a crisp - and not only for us, but also for the patrons around us). Our server didn't seem to notice the char that was supposed to be our toast, in fact, besides taking our order, he didn't speak at all. It was the busboy who inquired if things were okay, and offered to ask the kitchen to change the toast (we declined, as we had finished). The smoothie was quite watered down, and not what you'd expect from a 'supposedly' chic place, although the hot chocolate was not too shabby. Overall, a very average dining experience, much like going to a diner where the servers just take your orders and perhaps offer you coffee refills, not much more.
I just came back from having brunch at Le Cartet. It was, as always, delicious! Cartet is such a great place, it has a modern design with some small single tables and then a couple long communal tables in the back. Sitting at the long table can actually be pretty fun, since chances are you will be seated next to someone that's interesting and looks like they should be a model. (The crowd is usually filled with cool, young urban people.) It's pretty busy on the weekends, but the wait is never longer than 20 minutes. The servers are super friendly and very prompt. The menu offers a pretty wide variety of choices, my friend is a vegetarian and had plenty of options to choose from. All of the food is fresh and high quality. It's also always masterfully prepared and super tasty. Le Cartet is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Montreal, and somewhere you have to visit if you're in town.
Fantastic breakfast. Didn't look like much from the outside but inside a bustling hive of people having breakfast with people waiting to be seated although because there are so many tables it seemed to turn over quickly. I had the Brunch Cantons, basically cooked breakfast with the lot bacon, baked beans, ham, potato, scrambled eggs and breakfast sausage. Was very tasty. Service was quick and friendly. I would recommend it to anyone.
Excellent service, friendly staff.Nicely decorated place with creative and healthy menu. Strongly recommended for brunch.
Excellent brunch.  Good coffee, fresh fruit was grapefruit, orange and melon, all flavorful.  Eggs were cooked perfectly, fantastic breads. Great service as well.
Great stylish brunch spot in the old port. Good selection of food on the menu and the servings are generous. I had the brunch Cartet, which came with a ham and cheese croissant, salmon cake, salad, fruit skewer, aged cheddar, and a fig. It was so generous that I couldn't finish it, but it was delicious nonetheless. My friends ordered brunch sante and brunch atlantique and everyone was very satisfied with their food. If you go for the brunch and mimosa you're looking at about $30 with tip, but given the quality of the food, the service, and the beautiful decor it's worth it. Would definitely go back!
Based on some reviews, we decided to head here for a quick lunch on our way out of Montreal.Walking in I was completely amazed by the unsuspecting interiors of the place.  We stumbled upon this place around lunch time, so the joint was packed with the buzz of hungry people.The food selection was impressive and the service quite friendly considering how busy the place was.The only problem arose from there only being two servers for the entire lunch rush, which led to longer than ideal wait times for our food and bill.Afterwards, we picked up a few items from their great take out selection and headed on our way.All in all, the experience was quite positive: the food and the atmosphere were fantastic despite the service being a bit slow.
Le Cartet had decent selections, but I wasn't really impressed. The crepes weren't as tasty as I thought. I had the crabcakes and they were good but again not something to write about. Overall I would recommend this place for a nice brunch. They have a store in the front so that is worth visiting for gifts to bring to friends and family.
Simply amazing find
Had brunch there.  Even though I've read mixed reviews about this place, my dining experience there was decent.  The waiter was nice and friendly.I had cafe au lait avec lait de soya (pretty much a soy latte as it was made with expresso instead of coffee), and it came in a big soup bowl, interesting!  I got the brunch sucré (crepe with french toast).  It came with freshly squeezed orange juice, and that was just awesome!  I love the OJ.  They gave us an 'amusee-bouche,' which was like a bread pudding (and much larger than an one-biter!).  It was a bit cold but very tasty (cinnamon!!!).  My main course came with yogurt with granola and blueberries (decent), french toast with apple butter/blueberries.  The apple butter was good.  The french toast was a little disappointing though (a little stale perhaps?).  And it came with the 2 crepes with raspberry sauce and orange zest.  The crepes were disappointing.  The texture was a little rubbery.  Definitely not my favorite there.My friend got the Brunch Cartet (ham/cheese sandwich), and she said that was delicious.  My other friend got the Brunch L'Atlantique (salmon bagel, salmon with eggs, and salmon cake), and I totally prefer that over my sucré brunch!Aside from the brunch sucré, the food, the service, and the decor of Le Cartet was pretty good!
Had a great brunch.  Try the Toscan: poached egg, ham, spinach, and muffin with fresh fruit.  Fresh ingredients in a great atmosphere.Definately worth the trip on a weekend morning.  NIce selection of take out items, but seemed a bit overpriced for packaged up material.
* Nice physical spot, ok brunch *The physical layout of this spot is really nice.  It is a long narrow space with painted brick walls and wooden tables, along with about 8 sidewalk tables.  There is also a small food market towards the front, which had a very nice selection of chocolate and some local products like smoked duck in a can, etc.  I had brunch at one of the sidewalk tables.  The brunch included:- A sweet bread (not sweetbreads, but a cake like bread, which we were never served although saw all of the other tables getting)- A smoked salmon egg scramble, where the whites and yolks were not fully incorporated to each other- Half a bagel with cream cheese, smoked salmon, and capers (tasty local bagel with nice quality salmon)- A sweet potato and salmon cake (was a bit cold and crumbled apart but had nice salmon flavour)- A green salad (which was good, but slightly overdressed)- Some cut fruit (fine)- A glass of orange juice (unfortunately not fresh squeezed)- Coffee or tea (I had a nice quality tea, although the water was not as hot as it should be)The sidewalk tables suffer from the attack of many bees.  The two women at the next table had a constant battle (probably their strong perfume was saving our table a bit from the onslaught - but we had our fair share as well over the course of the meal).  My side tip - open some of the confiture packs and place them away from your table to attract the bees away - it seems to basically work!  Overall the brunch was ok, but nothing I would rush back for.
Probably one of the best breakfast experiences I've had.I chose Le Cartet for my first breakfast in Montreal, a Sunday morning.  The reviews for L'Avenue had stated the very long lines on Sunday, so I figured I'd do that on Monday instead.  Well much to my surprise, there was a long line here as well (about 25 minutes around 9:30am), and if it wasn't a sunny morning, you'd be stuck out in the rain or snow - as the line goes out the door and down the stairs to the outside.  Regardless, it's such a charming setting on the southern end of Rue McGill.  Once I was seated, I took in the minimalistic pleasantness of the restaurant.  High ceilings, rustic, white walls and columns, and it's set up like a long corridor with what appears like one, long table creating a communal setting, and also the option of separate tables around.  Each table was adorned with a huge, clear vase of fully-stemmed sunflowers!  One of my favorites!  I ordered the Brunch Sante, which consists of two poached eggs over toast that has been smeared in an herbed goat cheese and topped with greens, a side of yogurt mixed with granola and blueberries (the best), a dried fig, two medium-sized white cheddar sticks, a skewer of fresh fruit... and before they even bring it out, they give you a small cube of this delicious, most chocolate chip cake/pastry that gets all melty in your mouth full of Illy coffee.  This was easily my favorite meal from the entire trip!  It beats L'Avenue in terms of a clean, healthy, nutrient-rich breakfast - and the presentation is lovely.  Service is wonderful.  So sweet and caring.  It's $14.95, which is a decent deal for the amount of food you get (I eat like a pig and I couldn't finish), and it's worth every dime.  I can't wait to return again for breakfast, and also for lunch.  Don't skip Le Cartet if you're ever in Montreal.  It's on the way from downtown to Vieux Montreal (Old Montreal/Old Port), and a great stop along the way.
Over the new year week, we took off and escaped to the chilly weather of Montreal! We found numerous places for OK dining, but definitely the area you want to keep to is Old Montreal. This is where you get all things old and new and they meet right in the most unlikely of places. Somewhat hidden away from the grandness that is Old Montreal and off to a bit off a busier street is this place, Le Cartet. If I hadn't had my trusty iPhone indicating where I was versus where the restaurant was, i would never have found it on such a grand street. McGill Rue is a wide street with shops and restaurants. It's a street that leads directly to the Old Port. As soon as we walked in, I was comforted in the thought that we had stumbled onto a fabulous little breakfast joint. Up until then, we were at a kind of hit-or-miss with breakfast, so i was a bit uneasy that this might turn out badly, but I was delighted when i stepped inside. It's a nicely modern establishment with some rustic touches to the decor.  The menu is expansive and the portions are generous. My breakfast was marvelous indeed. I had le Brunch Sucre. And if that name is any indication, yes it was very sweet! I devoured the entire meal. It had everything from Crepes and fruit to French Toast. It was delicious! If you're in town, you should get out there. We were staying at the InterContinental and walked there, it was a cinch.
Cool little spot in Old Montreal area with good service and beautiful, minimalist modern decor.  Pre-packaged foods available at the front for quick lunch or picnics.  However, sit down for breakfast/brunch had limited menu and relatively high prices.
I want to be able to give this fresh place more stars, so maybe I'll go back and try again- but based on the brunch I had last Saturday, this is the most deserving rating.  It looks great when you walk in~ fresh food displayed, great decor.  The menu is diverse for brunch.  My friend got an egg dish and latte which she really enjoyed. I on the other hand had my mouth water over their Banana Coconut (french) Toast with Yogurt and fruit.  It looked good when it came (~5min after my friends dish), however the top toast was lukewarm and the bottom refridgerator cold bananas throughout the cold toast.  I asked the server if it was supposed to be cold and she apologized and took it away.  Only to return a few minutes later with the Same one I tried before, now pipping hot and soggy ~ I suspected microwave- and asked if that was the case. She said no, but  they would now make me a fresh one.  Surprised that didn't happen initially.  Much to my surprise, a "fresh" one arrived burnt! not just a little either...  Done with sending it back I ate around the most burnt pieces.  Coconut torched is not the most pleasant taste.  Maybe this was an anomaly, but surprised that this was my experience.  The good thing is that the waitress was very friendly and nice- but the kitchen was off for my dish.
Again, the yelp posting says its "Good for Kids: Yes" and I disagree slightly.  It's probably good for kids who can sit in their own seat and not in a high chair.  If you have a kid who needs a high chair, I would probably bring your own food for him/her.  The high chair that they brought was a bit disgusting. They obviously do not clean their high chairs every night. We were one of the first when they opened so it's not like tons of other kids used it before we got there.  Also the choices are few and far between for a one year old. There are no waffles, pancakes, or anything of that sort.WIth that being said, my quiche was tasty and was accompanied by a lovely side salad.  The coconut banana bread was also very yummy, not too sweet and not too coconutty.  My husband ordered the crab extravaganza - crab benedict, crab cakes, and some other crab item.  All were tasty.Our waiter was a bit stand-offish. I speak french but decided to speak english here and I felt like I paid for it. The waiter was unaccomodating, didn't smile, and ignored us.  We had to wave him down everytime we needed something. It's unfortunate. There was another waiter who stopped by to say hello to my daughter who was very sweet so I don't think all of their staff is half-bad.I would go back for sure...for the food and when my daughter is older!
Went here on a personal recommendation (heard it was Montreal's best kept secret of the Old City), and slightly underwhelmed. The portions are large and nicely presented, but the food itself is average. We ordered the brunch cartet (cheese was great, the salmon cake not so much) and tosta mixta (too much egg for this sandwich and slightly overcooked). I did find the interior pleasing to the eye, and in some ways, it reminded me of a NYC cafe (white walls, soaring ceilings, original wood floors below). Prices are super reasonable so that was nice, and since it's on the edge of the Old City, not very crowded even mid-day.
This lunch spot in Old Montreal looks quite unassuming from the street facade. However, the inside is quite spacious with a pleasing decor. The crowd is a mix of workers clad in business suit and trendy yuppies with plastic rimmed glasses.The front of the restaurant also has a nice selection of takeouts, including some gourmet canned food like "Duck smoked meat". Please remember that as a great alternative the next time you have an urge to buy a "5 Dollar Foot Long" for dinner :P  The food was quite good although I was a bit disappointed with the small size of my sandwich. My friend had the dish of the day (lamb rack served with polenta and veggies). Quite good and a good value according to him. The dessert made up for it. I tried both the Praline chocolate mousse and the Pecan pie: both delicious!it won't be my everyday lunch spot but worth a try. Expect to pay a little bit more. It's however expected considering the location.
After reading the reviews on yelp, I walked the mile here from my hotel.  I had had a late morning and was open to eating either breakfast or lunch when I arrived.  I walked in the door at 11:15 on a Thursday.  The place was almost empty.  I sat down and the server told me that they had just ended breakfast and that they wouldn't be starting lunch for another 20 minutes.I ended up getting food to go rather than wait 20 minutes for no reason.It's unfortunate that for some reason they can't find a way to continue to serve between meals when...well...they're a restaurant and I'm one person.The food I got to go was decent.  So the lesson of the day is...don't walk here at 11:15.
We stopped here for brunch on the way out of a weekend in Montreal, and were blown away by the food.  I had the Brunch Sante, which featured poached eggs over shredded greens, herbed chevre and multi-grain toast. It also came with ginger granola and blueberryies over a yogurt that had the consistency of creme fraiche, some fresh fruit, aged cheddar, and a fig.My wife had a Brunch Sucre, which included crepes, with blueberry and candied orange peel, toast topped with homemade apple-puree (almost half-way between applesauce and apple butter), and the yogurt/granola combo.  Both brunches came to about $15 each, and included drip coffee (delicious) and orange juice.  In addition, the space is beautiful, with excellent use of wood, metal and air to provide an open environment.  We were in a bit of a hurry, and though we never mentioned it, the food came promptly and our server was attentive.  If we hadn't been leaving the city, we would have definitely availed ourselves of the market in front, too.If you're visiting Montreal for a weekend, it's totally worth a stop.
Worth the wait! We waited outside on line for about 20 minutes before being seated. Once we started eating, we completely forgot about the wait. For $15 we were served a cup of coffee or cappuccino, a glass of fresh squeezed OJ, 2 poached eggs on toast that had been smeared with goat cheese (OUTSTANDING!!), a cup of fresh yogurt topped with homemade granola and black currants, and fresh fruit. Would have been a 5 star review, but the waiter forgot our Amuse Bouche and we had to ask multiple times for the check. In his defence, he was very friendly and the place was super packed.
A very interesting breakfast spot but not our favorite.  The ambience is great but loud.  Service was good.I had the brunch sante which was excellent.  There was a thin layer of cheese spread on the toast that held the mesclun under the poached eggs.  Made for a healthier version of eggs benedict.  The granola was flavorful.  The cheese sticks and fig capped it off nicely.  Sadly my wife did not have as good a meal.  They were out of potatoes at 1030am and the potatoes in duck fat was a key attraction.  Then the toast was cold when it came out.  And the eggs are not really scrambled but more like fried in a lump.  Its a very cool store and a place you could go before a picnic or outing to stock up.  The chocolate selection is impressive.  But i have to give it three stars since it was a four for me and a two for my wife
Went here for an early lunch. I thought it was quite good. My bf and I ordered sandwiches - grilled chicken and a roast beef. The grilled chicken was better than the roast beef. The real star of the meal was the carrot salad. It had this unexpected ginger flavor with some dried cranberries.
If you had one morning in Montreal - especially a Saturday or Sunday...Come here! Fresh, delicious food. The Berry French Toast was to die for. It was not your typical whip cream and syrup variety but very original and unique. I dined at the communal table which was fantastic. Families, groups, dates, solo? It doesn't matter. This is your go to spot for brunch in Montreal.
This is our long-standing first choice for a brunch with great value. By value, I mean the quality for the price. Yes, there are fancier brunches to be had, but when we're hungry and don't want to take any chances, Le Cartet is it. My husband gets the "des Cantons" brunch and I get the "Sante" brunch. The fresh OJ is much better in the warm months -- it's a bit too tart in the cold months. Usually there's lots of fresh fruit, but they didn't include that when we went in December 2013 -- why? :(. I also like to pick up some chocolate from their huge selection when we check out. We know when to arrive so we don't have to wait in a queue (before 11), and they generally have enough wait staff that service is good. When I worked in downtown Montreal, I often had lunch here or bought a to-go lunch and dessert. We like the spacious high ceilings and the basic decor. One reviewer from TO said it was sooooo passe, but having lived in Montreal for 7 years, and for 30+ years in the US, and some years in TO, I've seen that nothing is more fickle and silly than the Toronto foodie scene. Honestly, any place that would welcome Momofuku like it was the hottest thing ever is plain daft. Anyway, I can testify that Le Cartet has been solid and inviting for at least a decade, and is more inviting since the remodel. I hope it stays that way for another decade. because we'll continue to make it our destination.
the vogue-ified general store:Old Montreal:When I walked into Le Cartet I thought I was in a country general store, if said store was in a trendy New York burrow. It's got a Dean and Deluca feel, without the big box shadow.  The front area is a take-out coffee bar meets mini market whose shelves are filled with fancy preserves, designer chocolates, specialty teas, and a plethora of other goods as well as a cooler of fresh salads, sandwiches and pastas.  The rest is the restaurant.My sister and I loved the interior, right down to the signage.  The communal tables and open-window kitchen gave the place a laidback vibe, while the decor was classy and modern.  I loved the little details - fresh fall flowers and little pumpkins.  The buckets of natural light make it feel like the perfect brunch spot.The tables are pretty close together, but there's enough room that you don't feel like you're being invaded.  The menu isn't extensive, but you should be able to find something you like.  Traditional items are notably missing, such as benedicts and omlettes, but it's okay to embrace change once in a while.Their specials (all about $15) come with coffee and juice.  Love that.I had the Brunch des Cantons - their version of the big breakfast - served in a cast iron pan.  Love that.It had ham, sausage, bacon, scrambled eggs, beans, and potatoes, as well as a side plate of bread and fruit.  Three meats. Love that.My sister had the Toasta Mixta, a portuguese grilled egg sandwich with ham, brie, onions and mustard.  Tasted like our mom's egg sandwich.  Love that.Brunch is only served Saturday and Sunday from 9:00 a to 3:30 pm.  That's a narrow window, especially for a big stomach.  But do as I do, suck it in.
This is my go-to place for brunch in my 'hood. What I like about this place:- Simple and delicate yet NOT intimidating decoration, ambience, clientèle- My words won't do justice for other orders but here are some highlights when you order "Brunch des Cantons" ($11.95) the one I always get:a) before the main brunch, they bring you baguettes with confitures (tartinades)b) "Brunch des Cantons" is served on a heavy hot pan, to keep it warm. c) contains ham, sausage, bacon (all three meats! big+ for my in-decisiveness when it comes to choose one out of the three), home-made potatoes with fine herbs, fruits,  and take note Baguette. d) the portion is very generous (I can never finish everything, and I have a big appetite for breakfast)- Most of the waiters/waitresses are friendly, soft-spoken hipsters. So are the clients. Their clients are: 25% business people working around old-port, 35% Artists working in the area, 20% some tourists, 20% residence. - Yet another + for this place is they have a bar area behind cashier, where you can buy organic food, exotic products, lunch in boxes, illy coffee. - In the morning till noon, they have illy coffee for 2.5$. Points card, where you can collect points (10 coffee to get 1 for free)- Brunch for weekdays is 7am-11am; After that, they have lunch. Weekends from 9am to 3pm. There's usually a line for the weekends unless you get there before 11am.
An amazing selection of chocolate from around the world in the little store at the front of the restaurant!Great place for brunch: good food, stylish decor, friendly staff, light and airy space.
If you want to do breakfast right look no further than this place. You can keep it simple with a yogurt/granola combo or go all out and get awesome egg dishes, pancakes and so on. Things are lovingly prepared and it is the kind of place that will get you off on the right foot.
We were visiting Montreal for a week and ended up having breakfast there almost every day. Basically everything on the menu is delicious. We tried the Torta mixta, the eggs with goat cheese, the hazelnut toasts with applesauce and everything was delicious, not to mention their coffee, croissants, duck rillette and bacon. Also a great place to go with kids, because of how fast they are to serve and the service is Excellent! Sure going to miss this place when i go back home!
Wonderful. Food and service are great. Went twice during one 4 day visit. Good portions and despite the crowds we never waited for a table or for our food that long. Tres bien
Good place for breakfast/Brunch . sleek decoration. Fresh food . Good service
I'm always on the lookout for a cool place to get good eats during my lunch hour at work. One of my coworkers introduced me to Le Cartet, apparently the cat's meow of a fine foods market doubling as a gourmet restaurant.At first glance, one's appetite comes alive just by looking at the restaurant/food store. The setting is absolutely gorgeous. It has the feel of an American general store from an old mill town, fused with a very modern feel. Every little detail has been exhaustively looked over by a very crafty team of designers. The staff is meticulously dressed and hired to look the part the restaurateurs desired. No Saran Wrap here, it's a fine plastic wrapping you would find in a flower shop to pack roses. The facing of the product is immaculate. The table settings are just inviting and warm. It just reeks of Old Montreal Goodness. Local stars and Olympic athletes can be spotted grabbing a bite there.It just looks perfect.Emphasis on the "looks". Sometimes a cake is crap but the icing makes it look good enough to eat anyway. And Le Cartet is such an example.Let me take you through the culinary ordeal I went through. Let's begin with the salad entrée I took. A simple looking salad, which is the way it should be to kick-start one's digestion properly. It comes with a vinaigrette de Provence. Unless you have unclean or not so fresh lettuce, the dressing makes or breaks the salad. When I say Provence, if you enjoy wine, a nice wine-based dressing will most likely come to mind. Certainly not chili peppers, which are from Central and South America. Well, the dressing was made up of mostly chili peppers. Not being a lover of spicy foods (I feel spices take away the tastes of the food I'm eating) I immediately put aside the spice-ridden salad because it was awful.Next in my meal was a simple egg salad sandwich on rye bread. I should spell that drye bread. It was too dry even for a corned beef sandwich. But wait, it gets worse. How they accomplished this is beyond me, but the egg salad was also dry. A good mayonnaise should be tangy and moist; I couldn't taste anything of the sort other than flat, boring mayonnaise. Throw in some herbs at least or some garlic, give it some punch. And the piece of Romaine lettuce still had the heart attached to it. It was big enough to choke someone. But since I had to eat something and I wasn't about to dole out another fifteen dollars for lunch, I finished the sandwich, washing it down with water so it could pass my oesophagus; yes it was that damn dry. But that's not all. Since it was my first run at the restaurant I even treated myself to some dessert -- a lovely Tarte Tatin. This, for the uninitiated, is good ol' apple pie from France -- basically your regular apple pie but with the top caramelised with butter and sugar. Caramelised, not carbonised into extinction. When I took my first bite, hoping that the dessert would save me from this so far revolting experience, I cringed when I smelled the charred layer of burnt sugar and it was too late. The final straw.The only thing that tasted okay was the water -- the one in the Evian bottle.The problem with gourmet restaurants is that they fear the fat -- if you want taste, you must embrace the fat. It's what makes food taste good, end of story. Slap on some butter, some cream, or some punchy mayonnaise. The fat is the drummer of the food band. If you ain't got the beat, if you ain't got the rhythm, it's all for naught.The restaurant gets a point for impeccable presentation and none for anything else. A big fat one out of five. Want good French cuisine in Old Montreal?  For lunch, stick to Cluny's, and put a cross over Le Cartet.
This is a great spot for brunch with generous portions.
I had a couple of nice brunches there with friends. Tried the sweet dish and the savory dish, the crusty crunchy toast and de awakening coffee. Will go back there again for its communal seating and of course the food.
My sister and I really enjoyed Cartet in April.  If the day is nice and the wait is long, get prepared items from the shop section and picnic.  We waited just long enough for me to buy blueberry chocolate spread from the shop (AMAZING).  Brunch menu is extensive, and we both ordered huge plates with a little bit of everything.  Sister--Brunch de L'Atlantique: Eggs with smoked salmon, half a bagel with all the typical accoutrements, greens, a little sweet potato and salmon cake, and fruit. Me: Brunch de Sante--yogurt with granola and blueberries, poached eggs on greens, and grilled bread, cheddar sticks, and a fig.  And it came with coffee and juice, all for $15.  This is the kind of plate I would dream up for myself at home.
Came here for brunch one time.  Interesting setup here.  It's a mini-store that also serve as a restaurant.  They have communal tables in the back where you can share with other people.  Pretty wide selection for brunch, good portion, orange juice was great.Pros - There was a lot of good looking boys at brunch that we stared at! :)
Sometimes life gets too busy or exciting for mundane things like getting groceries or cooking, and you need a neighbourhood go-to place where you can pick up a relatively healthy meal on the run. For me, Le Cartet is that place. I know I can always grab a goat yogurt, a fruit cup, and an Illy coffee for breakfast. For lunch, they have a nice selection of sandwiches and salads. My favourite is a salad with salmon two ways: smoked and flaked with some mayo. The shelves are full of a variety of gourmet items, including enough varieties of fancy chocolate to keep even the most die-hard chocoholic busy for days on end. They also do a pretty killer brunch and a decent sit-down lunch. In summer they have a few tables on the McGill sidewalk.
Had the Atlantic brunch plate - it was outstanding... what a great combination of all the ways you could enjoy salmon...  well worth the wait, and have already recommended this to other friends visiting Montreal.  As a frequent brunch diner in NYC, I can honestly say that this place was brilliant, and that many NYC places could learn from Montreal about brunch - especially the skewer of fresh fruit!
Meant to eat breakfast here, but didn't get there until breakfast had finished (although the signs all seemed to say we had another hour before breakfast closed...).  I'm guessing the breakfast would still be great, but the lunch was really disappointing.  It wasn't bad per se, but wasn't better than anything I make in my own kitchen (I got the ham and cheese sandwich - very boring, my husband got an overpriced quiche that was very similar and not better than one I make at home).  Coffee was fantastic though, and the ambiance was pretty cool.  Wait staff seemed annoyed at our existence, and although we're annoying, I don't think we gave them enough to know that.  Overall, maybe it's as good as they say for breakfast, but I would definitely say skip this one for lunch.
I had a delicious lunch here.  The Plat du Jour for $13 was a big portion of perfectly cooked bowtie pasta with a pesto and goat cheese sauce.  A couple of slices of grilled peppers sat on top looking very pretty.  I washed it down with a glass of Illuminati Riparosso for $7.50.  They had a high chair for my friend's baby.  I love the long communal tables but they also have individual tables.  The room is long, narrow and modern in decor but still feels cozy and intimate as the tables are quite close to each other.  I could have spent more time drooling over all the delicious gourmet foods up front that you can buy to go.  I heard that if you buy food you can also buy wine to go.  This would be a perfect spot to pick up your picnic ingredients in Old Montreal.
Excellent service, great food, great coffee.  The ambiance was nice as well, bustling with people and tastefully decorated.  The eggs benedict were amazing, though not listed on the menu under that name.  Croissants were just ok, as was the bread.  Had the bowl of cafe au lait, which was the highlight for me.
i usually go for saltier/egg-y brunches but this time i tried out their sweet brkfst meal (i dont remember off the top of my head the name, but it came with plain yogurt/crepes/toast/apple sauce/fruits). it was amazing! the plain yogurt was a nice way to off-set all the sweet stuff.surprised this place has such few reviews. no regrets. i'm from Toronto but if i ever go back to Montreal, definitely hitting up this spot again.
great atmosphere, fantastic brunch, friendly service....
Great ham & cheese baguette though not much for my husband (vegetarian). Excellent selection of chocolate bars inside, and I am regretting that I didn't order a chocolate dessert, they looked amazing!
Hot of the press! No, not the panini press or a sandwich press. Olive & Gourmando will now be open 7 days a week. Yes.. Seven! Now for those that are a fan, you can understand the joy of this. For those that are not(Yet!) a fan.. Well, you will eventually appreciate the opening of 7 days. FIou! I feel better now. I simply needed to share this with all of you. Now the real reason why I'm here. To write a review. I can honestly say that there is nothing negative to write about. No, nothing. The only thing I was planning to mention is the long waiting time for a table and how crowded it gets each time I go. Now with being open 7 days, I think this will relieve the line-ups. Wait! Don't get turned off by the long waiting time.. It's worth it. I promise you!Yes, most restaurants with very few exceptions are pricey and none other than a tourist trap. Olive and Gourmando is not at all one of them.Their main focus is on the locals that come and enjoy an outstanding breakfast, or lunch. Each of their meals, pastries  are simply delicious and well presented. This is not about big or huge portions of pancakes and waffles or massive amounts of sausage and bacon. This is about using local and delicious things to make it all about quality. Their pastries are oh so crumbly and buttery, along touches of Valrhona chocolate in some of their pastries. Nothing is overly sweet or greasy.  Again, just perfect! I ordered the homemade granola with Greek yogurt and fruits. It was a good portion with such generous amounts of fresh berries, apples, grapes and oranges. The fruits were perfectly ripe and juicy. Because I'm not a coffee drinker, I put a lot, yes a lot of focus on hot chocolate. Their hot chocolate was out of this world!! A simple glass of hot steamy milk(Perfect temperature) with a generous amount of Valrhona cocoa. You put as much sugar as you desire. Perfect! At last a hot cocoa that is not packed with 90% sugar and 10% chocolate. We arrived at 11:30am on a Friday. It was packed! Wait.. Give it a try anyways. The service was very professional, efficient and so fast. For all these reasons, I insist you go try it again and again. Either if you live in Montreal or you're a tourist. You will certainly love this place. Like I said.. I promise!
Olive & Gourmando, or 'o+g' is a small little breakfast/lunch spot that is known for their paninis.  Besides hot paninis, they also have cold sandwiches, daily plates (such as mac & cheese, salads, etc.), as well as breakfast items (such as granola, homemade ricotta, etc.). Just make sure you request both of the menus, as you can order from either/both of them. This place was bustling when I walked in, but the host is great at remembering the queue and seating parties quickly.  I tried their O+G Grilled Cheese hot panini that was filled with caramelized onions, Raclette, and Gouda Beemster XO, served with a cup of housemade ketchup; the caramelized onions were a bit too overpowering, and the housemade ketchup was a thin consistency of a sweeter sauce (I found this not to complement the panini at all); and, the 'Poached egg on your face' panini (filled with spicy poached eggs with herbs, mayo, Louis d'Or cheese, speck, and slow-roasted tomatoes; this was definitely the better of the two paninis, but it has a spicier kick; the taste kind of reminded of Korean spicy pork sauce (dwegi bokkeum sauce), so it had a familiar taste to it).  I appreciated the crispiness of the bread, but note that they don't brush the bread slices with olive oil or butter.  I'm open to trying out their other kinds of paninis, as I really did like the thing crusty/crispy breads holding the fillings together.  To wash it all down, I tried their raspberry & lime beverage, which seems to be the place's version of a limeade with some raspberry juice - it wasn't as tart as I thought it would be, but more of a smoother finish.  Service was super friendly and efficient, and complimentary water is offered in an olive oil bottle. Once you're done, remember your seat location and pay up at the front!+known for their paninis+raspberry lime beverage+fast and efficient service+crowded during breakfast/lunch rush
This place gets busy, so plan to wait or just get your food to go.The coffee and food were both great, although my first choice of a meal was already sold out when we showed up. I took this as a good sign because it must mean they have fresh ingredients and aren't wasteful. The dining area can get very crowded so expect to sit near some strangers, but who knows, you just might make a new friend over a cup of coffee or breakfast.
-TIP INCLUDED ON BILL-Decided to come for lunch Time with a friend it was snowing and packed which is always a good sign as long as you aren't all squished in. We got a seat at the window with a bar table style which was the last open seat. I was skeptical at first but it was beautiful at the big window with the snow falling. Reminded me a bit of Paris (love the old port.) great view !Staff was friendly and smiley and knew her wine which is always a plus.It's not a cheap place two salads and a sandwich a small hot chocolate and wine was 70 $! BUT they added the tip to the bill which we forgot about when we read the menu so we left 80, not a huge deal but do be aware this time you don't make the same mistake as us.The Cesar salad with chicken has kale in it and a light dressing (home made dressing) and lean thinly sliced chicken with bacon and croutons and capers of course.The Cuban sandwich was really good had this pickled mayo and thinly sliced meat and cheese. The salad 24 was a tofu salad with Asian noodles and peanut butter dressing. It's a really good salad if you want something light and healthy.
Came here for an 11 am brunch on a Wednesday. The place was crowded and rustic. Very small. The waiter initially told us we needed to wait 45 mins for a table of 5, then suggested splitting us up which would seat us immediately. It was super awkward. My friend and I went to a table while the other 3 waited. There were clearly tables that we're going to be empty very soon, but he seated us at the other end of the restaurant. After my friend spoke to him he came and got us and voila! A table for 5 magically appeared. It was a crummy awkward start to the meal.The service was pretty horrible. We grabbed our own menus. No one explained anything to us (like how we can order off the breakfast as well as the lunch menus, and they were 2 physically separate menus). I ended up getting the habibi chicken sandwich. The only egg option was the poached eggs and they had RUN OUT OF EGGS. I was in need for protein. Unfortunately they also didn't have French toast. The sandwich was cold (yes I get it it's called a cold sandwich but it was too cold), jam packed with a handful of dill!!!! Wow way too much. It was overpowering even when I tried to scrape most of it off. The latte was good but wasn't hot enough to my taste, I don't enjoy lukewarm coffee.I won't be coming back here and I don't recommend this place.
Finding a solid place to eat in Old Montreal can be a challenge sometimes since this part of the city is loaded with tourist traps.  That being said if you know where to look you can find a good restaurant or café.  I had heard loads of good things about Olive and Gourmando for a long time but since I rarely find myself in Old Montreal for lunch I only made it there for the first time recently.  So is it really as good as everyone says?  Yes indeed!It is a café but you are seated by a host and served by a waiter.  The place is packed at lunch so either get there early or try and go after the lunch rush has died down.  If you are one or two people consider eating at the counter.  They have typical café food which is why it is best as a lunch place.  You can expect a variety of sandwiches, salads, soups and so on.  They do have wine and beer if you so desire but I skipped that since it was lunch and I was on my way to a meeting.I kept it simple and got a latte and grilled cheese.  The latte was as good as any coffee shops here in Montreal and I enjoyed it quite a bit.  The star though was the grilled cheese which was made with goat cheese, raclette and caramelized onions.  It was wildly delicious and there was so much cheese that it was oozing at the sides and that is a good thing in my opinion!  Now I like ketchup with my grilled cheese but for a sandwich of this calibre Heinz just won't cut it.  Of course they know that only the finest condiments are acceptable for their food so they serve up the grilled cheese with a homemade spicy ketchup.  While it wasn't very spicy it certainly put Heinz to shame.Now you can't come here and not get a goodie.  When you're ready for dessert head over to the display of pastries.  This will probably be the hardest part of your whole experience because here you will be faced with the arduous task of narrowing your choices down to just one.  Ultimately I settled for a banana-chocolate brioche which was so fresh and loaded with chocolate and big chunks of banana.  The pastry was very flaky and as a whole the experience was divine!The service was another highlight.  My waiter was very friendly and despite the fact that the café was completely packed I got everything I ordered in a reasonable time frame.  As soon as I was seated they gave me a glass and my own pitcher of water.  I was really thirsty when I arrived here so I really appreciated this.It is expensive and for me that was a downside.  The latte, grilled cheese and brioche came to $23 and of course because it was a sit down place I also had to tip the waiter so in all I paid about $26.  While I don't mind treating myself once in a while I wouldn't routinely pay that for lunch.  That being said I would put Olive and Gourmando on my list of places to check out when I'm in the area because it is too good to pass up.
Great serviceGreat foodGood atmosphere (?)To get in during rush hours you usually have to wait around ~20 mins, and there WILL be a line. This place is usually packed and comes with it, the chatter, so it's pretty noisy which I didn't really like. Around 5 minutes in, our waiter came right away and she was super friendly and very informative about the menu. We ordered a grilled cheese and the reuben which is a smoked meat panini but it took a bit long for our meal to arrive. Once I took the first bite though i noticed that their panini bread was extremely crispy which made it taste so good! The meal was affordable and I was pretty content with my choice. I also took the double chocolate cookie to go and it was amazing! Lots of chocolate chunks yummm There shouldn't really be a reason for me to not rate this place a 5/5 but it just didn't wow me. The food was really good, but I guess I heard so much hype about this place that my standards were too high. Still though, definitely a place to check out if you're around the Old Port area!
I have a big problem with O&G. Every time I walk by the restaurant, I am unable to control myself and I absolutely must eat 2 Cuban sandwiches. It's a big problem because that's over 20$ every time I walk by this restaurant, but I just can't help it. I must have the sandwiches. The Cuban sandwich melts in your mouth and it's like you're having a party and the whole city is invited.It's a pain to wait in line and the service is slow but da*n that sandwich is good. It's the best sandwich in the world. DAMN YOU O&L!
Best Brownie Ever!!! And an awesome place for lunch in the old city and worth the wait. The long lineup is a testament to the quality of the food and environment. The food is fresh and delicious. The people working and eating there create a welcome buzz that feeds the experience. This is a local favourite that delivers a hip feel and delicious food. Sitting in the restaurant having a nice lunch and drinks made me feel part if the Montreal community.
DELICIOUS!!!! Seriously, this was one of my favorite places to have lunch while visiting Montreal. They have the best paninis and the soup I had was scrumptious! I highly recommend the "Gustavo" panini. The soup of the day was a Chicken & Cauliflower soup that had a hint of spice. It was sooooooo good! The servers were super nice too! This is a perfect little cafe and worth the wait. Can't wait to revisit. Awesome lunch!
A great cozy place for lunch. Fills up fast on the weekends, so come early or make a reservation to avoid the wait. We tried the pork sandwich and gourmet mac n cheese which were both good. The soup was exceptional! Their desserts and pastries are also amazing. We had the best coconut macadamia nut cookie ever!  The only thing that was mediocre was the chai latte. But overall, very satisfied with food and service.
Was here last night was great loved it!
Recommended by a local and co-worker. "Don't let the wait scare you" she said. Apprehensive by her comment, I rolled in solo at noon on a Wednesday. I was seated immediately. The wait staff speaks in French and English. They were overly  nice and accommodating. I ordered the Soupe de jour -yummy culinary concoction with sausage AND "the Cubain". A hot toasted flat bread with sliced seasoned pork, perfectly selected melted cheese and pickled mayonnaise. Delicious beyond delicious. Bon appetit!
Popped in toward the end of their brunch and it was still pretty crowded, but we managed to snag a table for two by one of their cute little windows.The space is great. Chalkboards with doodles and menu items cover the walls and the cute cafe by the entrance has some goodies for sale. The space gets crowded quick but it's a lively atmosphere. In the summer, there's no AC but thank the heavens this is a corner location and the open air windows let in a slight breeze.Once seated, our server informed us a lot of the menu items are done for the day since its the end of brunch but the options left sounded just as delightful. I had the mixed salad with chicken and my boyfriend had the Cuban sandwich. Both were SPECTACULAR. Although it was a different take on a classic, this was probably the best Cuban I've ever tried. The pesto mayo made this dish! The mixed salad sounds so simple but it was SO good, the toasted almonds and the chopped chicken gave this salad the kick it didn't even need. I loved how light but tasty the dressing was. I wanted to come back the next day to have the same meal again, even though I don't like visiting the same restaurant twice while on vacation. It was that good.This place isn't overrated or as pretentious as it sounds or looks - go check it out!
Yelped this place and so happy.  Incredible ambiance,  food, and although only one beer on the menu...it was terrific.  Thanks Yelp!
Looking for a good cup of coffee and pastry, my doorman recommended this place - and he was right, it is fantastic! The place is small and every table was full with a wait. I just grabbed a late and croissant to go. The late was made perfectly. Oh, and the croissant...oh la la! It did remind me of Paris.
The food is simply AMAZING. Don't hesitate when you see the line, don't let the mass of confused tourists or the seriously rude hostess put you off. The egg panini is one of my favourite things in the city, and the daily salads are always great, different and healthy. The wine selection leaves a lot to be desired but at least they're trying!
This place is so good, you can never get a seat. I advise you come by during the summer.  lots of nice places for a little picnic in Old Mtl.
This place gets 5 stars from me, at least from the breakfast standpoint. We came here because it was a highly recommended spot located in Old Montreal, and we wanted to try it out. For breakfast I had a coffee, and the granola. The granola is amazing it comes with yoghurt and a bunch of different types of fruit. It was delicious. I also had a chocolate and banana pastry which was super yummy as well.This place is very busy but we were seated and served pretty quickly. I really liked this place and would totally come here again.
Came here on Saturday for lunch around 12pm. The host told us it would be a 25-30 minute wait, but when we came back around 12:30pm, he told us another 25 minutes, so that was pretty annoying that the estimated timing was wayyy off, but we got coffee at a nearby café so that was fine. They also serve coffee and pastries in the takeout line, so that's nice to have while you wait.The place itself is very cozy and cute. We sat on a communal table and I ordered a Goat Cheese and Onion Panini and a raspberry lemonade. The Panini came with a homemade ketchup which was thinned out ketchup that was sweet but still tangy - it complemented the sandwich perfectly. I couldn't finish the whole Panini by myself. My friends ordered the Cuban sandwich and the Cajun Chicken Sandwich, which they all enjoyed. Great to share the Paninis with friends for some variation in your overall meal. I was sad to hear that they ran out of the egg in your face Panini -- I really wanted to try that!The service was pretty quick as all the sandwiches were premade, which I thought it was odd, considering sandwiches are pretty quick to make, but I was happy with our overall meal.
Located in Old Montreal but was a really good restaurant!! I came there twice because the Cuba panini was only on lunch menu. It deserves visiting again.My friend and I had two divine brioches for breakfast. My chocolate and banana one was the best of the world! Too much chocolate inside! Not too sweet but very crispy. Soooo nice~ The Cuba panini was crunchy outside and gooey inside. Melting cheese with bacon and salty turkey, never forgot. Because it was the last meal in Montreal.The staff were all very pretty and friendly. Love the ambience and decoration of the restaurant. The price was reasonable.
I'm one of those annoying vegans and I love this place. The atmosphere is really great. On-trend, inviting, youthful but also really classic. My dad introduced me to this place (embarrassingly enough) - it's populated by both in-the-know older folks and cool looking younger people. I guess that doesn't really matter in terms of reviewing the food, but just to give an idea of what the place is like! I really enjoyed the hand-drawn chalk board menu. Service is prompt and on occasion sassy, but in an enjoyable way. The food I've had here has always been excellent - I've had both soups and salads. Very thoughtfully constructed food with a very pleasing balance of flavour and texture. I haven't tried the pastries, since I don't believe any of them are vegan friendly, which is such a shame because they look delicious. Regardless I'm just ecstatic I can eat vegan stuff here but also bring friends here who are meat-eaters in the mood for some meat. Good lattes also! They have soy milk as an option.Only one bathroom, which is a little awkward, so there's usually a lineup. Speaking of line-ups - I've never had to wait less than 45 minutes to be seated here, so keep that in mind if you're looking for a quick bite.
Great truffle mac and cheese and cubano. A little pricey, especially for the drinks and the beer. Overall great experience.Also, tax essentially comes to 15 percent and can appear to look like tip. Tip in Montreal is a little lower than in the states at 15 percent tip.
Every time I set foot in here for breakfast (or lunch), I'm always pleased with the food quality, the excellent & friend service and the eclectic and welcoming decor!You'll often hear patrons of Olive & Gourmand complimenting them on the "concept"... interesting because when you ask veteran Marie-Helene and Sandra, or "old crusts" as they jokingly call themselves, there is no concept. It's just the result  of a slow evolution of bringing goodness and joy to people, season after season.The hustle and bustle can perhaps turn off some people who prefer quietness when sipping their café but if you're like me and love the vibe, the energy, the possibility of striking serendipitous conversations with locals or out-of-towners, and the soothing humming of the hustle & bustle this iconic place delivers then you're in for happy times!
The best cuban sandwich in Montreal according to me. And the best in North America, according to Anthony Bourdain.In fact, all sandwiches are pretty awesome. But how to resist O+G's sandwich filled with gooey gruyère, ham, pork loin and their secret sauce? Feeling a bit more healthy? The "24" salad with asian flavors is a good choice too.And how to resist their beautiful selection of baked desserts?Did I say how I love O+G ? Try it, you won't be disappointed.
Olive & Gourmando is located in Old Montreal on Saint Paul. It is just a couple of blocks off of the river near the old port.As other yelpers have written the place does a brisk business, mainly with the tourist trade. However, Olive & Gourmand is a pretty good place for fresh baked goods, good coffee and an excellent brunch. We had about a 20-minute wait for our table for 3.The food we had was all very fresh and had nice flavors. I had the Goat Cheese Sandwich (Mild goat cheese paillot and caramelized onions. Served with their house made ketchup) and it was excellent. We also had coffee and some really special baked goods.The prices are not too bad either being in the heart of the tourist district. Our server was really nice also.
I think I definitely worked this place up in my head by reading all the reviews and then was a bit disappointed. Don't get me wrong the food is good and the quality of the ingredients is great. But is it worth the price, the wait and sitting shoulder to shoulder cramped with other guests...probably not. I've been here twice. Once for take out and once for a sit down meal. For take out I ordered the banana chocolate brioche and a cappuccino. It was good. The pastry was delicious. However I think the tiny cappuccinos are quite overpriced and nothing special. For the sit down meal I got there at 10:40 am and it wasn't too busy. I tried to order the 'in your face egg panini' which they were sold out of. How do you sell out of eggs and bread at a breakfast place by 10:40? It wasn't a big deal, but it made a difference since their menu is already very small and limited. I also noticed it's a trend in the other reviews. Anyways I ordered the ricotta with honey and bread and an almond croissant. Both were delicious. The ricotta is creamy and refreshing. The almond croissant is good but overpriced in my opinion. I do have to say that the service there was lovely. Everything was delivered quickly and with a smile. However overall I think this place is a bit overrated. Would I go here for lunch once in a while if I worked nearby, sure. Would I go out of my way to come here? Probably not. There are so many other cafes in this area with incredible cappuccinos and pastries at almost half the cost and half the crowds.
Honestly, I don't understand the hype. Sure its a nice place to get a coffee and a pastry, but its not a breakfast or brunch restaurant. They were sold out of the one egg dish they serve and so we each had a parfait which was basically our only other "non pastry" option. Plan to eat before or after your visit to O&G.
TREAT YO SELF. This place is worth the $$$AMAZING food. I was in Montreal for a total of 24 hrs & this place was recommended to me by a friend. I do not speak French. At. All. The waiter was so patient with me & did his best to explain the specials of the day. He ended up just simplifying the day's soup to "chicken noodle soup" & also recommended one of the sandwiches. I felt so bad after. The soup was amazinggggg it did not deserve to be simplified to a mere chicken noodle soup & for that I'm so sorry. It was so good. The sandwich was such a large portion & so great, I had half & saved the other half for later. I ate it cold on the train later, and let me tell you something... when a sandwich that is loaded with cheese still tastes great cold, it really speaks to how yummy it is when it's served hot, straight from the kitchen. It's also located in old Montreal, which is such a great place to walk around & take in the old architecture. COMPLETELY 100% recommend!!
Amazing paninis and the curry & cream of squash soup of the day was delicious. 10/10, will come back next time I visit Montréal.
I love how this place feels! Very cozy and hipster - you'll know what I mean. The staff was very organized despite the place being very busy. We were given a place all the way in the back corner of the shop and I was worried that we would be forgotten - we weren't. If you ever wanted to try that increasingly popular 1642 Montreal Cola, then look no further. I tried the grilled Cuban panini and it was good - crunchy and cheesy. The habibi chicken, in my opinion, was better. Anything tastes good with garlic, pickles, and dill. Also there are vegetarian and vegan options if you're not a meat eater.If you're passing nearby the Old Port then you should definitely come by this place.
From the ratings to the many reviews on here, it's as good as it gets so I won't repeat the others, but a few of my own tips and observations:Let me preface that I was just visiting Montreal for the weekend, first time in the city.I came here essentially to get that Eggs In Yo Face (I'm sure you know what I mean) breakfast sandwich.  Note: The place currently opens at 9 am (on Saturdays).  From reading blogs, it suggested we get there at 8:30, we arrived at 8:40 to a closed restaurant. We walked around and came back at 9:04 and already there was a line. Luckily we managed to snag some seats at the high table though so definitely come early, this place is as popular as they say! I asked if I could get the sandwich without cheese - DENIED.  Said the cheese was already pre-mixed into the eggs.  I decided to chance it. I've hated cheese my entire life, I've become quite adept at picking out cheese from food.  And glad I did, because all I had to do was open the sandwich and not eat the side on which the cheese was melted. The rest was delicious and cheese free (uhm...but this also means the cheese could have easily been left out but....whatever).  I asked for a knife and fork from a passing waitress (crucial tools in my cheese extraction)...who reluctantly gave them to me with this request: "please be careful of the plates when  using the knife and fork, the plates scratch easily and can also break if you press too hard" - uhm. really? I need to be careful of breaking plates.....at a restaurant.....with my utensils?  Sounds like someone bought some useless plates. They were very pretty though.So why 5 stars for a place that refused me to go cheeseless and warns you of heavy utensil use? Cuz the food is delicious! Really, go and get the sandwich. I miss it already. Also the vibe is great. Lovely cozy spot perfect for breakfast to fuel you up for a day of sightseeing. Also, our main server (male) was great, super nice and friendly and overall we had a great meal. Approx $70 Canadian (including tip) for 2 sandwiches, 1 fruit bowl, 1 pastry, 2 coffees and 2 very fresh squeezed orange juice for a party of 3.
Excellent food and friendly staff. The Reuben sandwich was the best panini I've ever had.I also managed to drop over $200 on the floor as I was paying and one of the staff ran after me in the snow for a few blocks to return it.
Ok you've probably read it all about olive and gourmando but it really is worth the hype. We had the gourmando chicken sandwich and it was Devine. They soldOut of the cold sandwiches which I hear is pretty common. Expect to wait or try going an hour before closing. We got lucky and had a table right away. I had the only beer they had. It was a Canadian brew (blonde) it was very good. Simple sandwiches make for delicious sandwiches. Nothing is overstated about this place which is probably why it's so good. Just one of those places that live up to the hype.
Best meal we had while in Montreal. Get the Pannini.
Yummy. Came in here at 11am on a Thursday. Trying to beat the crowd. That didn't happen. It was packed already!! We waited about 5 minutes to be seated. There were a lot of young and middle aged hip Quebecers at this joint. Strangers sitting next to strangers. Tight seating. Very enjoyable. This is a place people go for good food and a good sangwich. Menu is diverse with eclectic choices. I went with the grilled cheese and an espresso. It came to me promptly after ordering it. It did not disappoint. As I took my first bite and felt the salty crunch beneath my teeth I knew this was going to be good. Bite. Tangy onions. Salty cheese. Bite chew bite bite chew bite chew and some swallows mixed in there. I finished it quickly because it was so good and I just couldn't stop myself. The espresso had a nice burnt chocolaty taste. It was a good espresso. Not the best I've ever had but it was good. We didn't get pastries to to but there were an ample amount of them and they all looked good. I bet they all had a nice crisp to them just like my sandwich. Go to this place and get a sandwich. You can thank me later.
During that rainy day, we were strolling along the streets of Old Montreal.  It seemed like we were the only ones in the city as we were exploring the area.  Came across Olive & Gourmando, and it was packed with people!  Guess everyone was hanging out at this cozy little cafe.  Fortunately, we were able to grab two spots at one of their communal tables.Did not try any of their sandwiches.  We wanted to try their baked goods.  They looked so mouthwatering delicious in their display as we walked in.  Purchased 4 items.Brioche Choco Banana ($3.95)Almond Croissant ($3.75)Banana Nut Muffin ($3.75)Brownie ($3.75)Each item tasted quite good.  No, "Wow" factor with regards to the taste, though.  Would try some of their many other baked goods next time.Overall, Olive & Gourmando is a fine establishment.  Although it was a bit loud and crowded inside, I liked the ambiance.   Service and cleanliness was also fine as well.
I had not truly experienced a brioche until I came here.The sandwiches were delicious, but months later the brioches that stay with me (both in memory and in actuality, on my thighs).  They are astoundingly good.   My friend and I came here twice on our long-weekend trip to Montreal, and munched on brioches and other pastries on the ride home.   The banana chocolate brioche was my favorite.   It gets crowded fast, so get there early, I would say before 11am if possible, if you don't want to wait  a long time for a table.  On the bright (or dark, depending on your perspective on temptation) side, you can admire the piles of amazing looking pastries -- the details of the sheen on the glazed gigantic croissants, the crumbly nooks on the scones, the powdered sugar on the brioches.  The savory goods were indeed good -- I believe we had the Cuban and the Cajun Chicken, both delicious.  If you're planning a trip to Montreal and intend to visit O&G, note that they are closed on Sundays and Mondays.
This place came highly recommended to me. I was visiting Montreal for the first time, and I was told that this cafe had the best coffee and baked goods. There was an off-hand mention of the "beautiful but ill-tempered" employees but I glossed over it. MISTAKE.We arrived and were seated promptly. Upon attempting to order, we discovered they were out of nearly everything we wanted. It was around 11am, and they told us they were out of coffee and the first two sandwiches I tried to order. I work as a waitress in a restaurant. I understand that it is not the fault of the waiters that items run out. However, the rude, irritated attitude of the waiter was uncalled for. If your menu is only 10-12 items long and 2 of them are sold out, you should tell people before they survey the menu. Or apologize for the inconvenience. I tried to order a third sandwich modified without mushroom, which I was told was not possible. I ended up ordering the vegan sandwich.The sandwich was excellent.That being said, the overall experience was so poor that I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. There are plenty of other restaurants in Montreal with exceptional food and good service.
ATMOSPHEREWalking in, there were pastries and coffee at the front and seats in the back for a sit down meal. We got there quite late, circa 245 pm, and found that there was still a 45 minute wait. This cozy little spot is notorious for a wait, but it was well worth it. FOOD The only disappointing thing was how much had sold out by then! All the cold sandwiches I wanted to try were out. Alas, I took a deep breath and decided upon having a chicken kale caesar salad. Boy was it tasty! And THAT BREAD. So delish. Next time I'm in, I'd like to make it earlier to try one of the sandwiches. And if you don't have the luxury of time, do yourself a solid and get a croissant and/or a few pastries for the road.OVERALLComing back the next time I'm in town. Such a cute spot and I'm determined to get a sandwich next time around!
Turns out my internal vacation clock is perfect for avoiding crowds. No line ups at 4PM on a Saturday, though a few items were unfortunately sold out (the regular croissants, all three hot dishes, and a seafood dish). We were here for the ricotta (sweet) that my companion had hailed as the best thing ever and were sad to have missed breakfast hours. Except! Breakfast menu turns out to be available all day. Now the difficulty of choosing between the sweet (which we were here for) and the salty (which also seemed well reviewed). Alas, we got both - and thankfully we did! Both very well balanced and refreshing. The RICOTTA (SALTY) - with sauteed broccolini, pine nuts, parmesan, and dried currents, served alongside ricotta drizzled in olive oil and a healthy sprinkling of black pepper. beautiful combination of creamy, crunchu, chewy, salty, sweet, bitter, hot, cold. Everything. The RICOTTA (SWEET) was far less complex in ingredients but just as flavourful. Orange zest, (possibly orange-infused) honey, and salt flakes garnishing ricotta. Both are incredibly refreshing and different enough that it didn't seem like we were overloading on the ricotta. Both also came with enough slices of crusty bread to scoop it all up, except we got an extra CHEESE CROISSANT for good measure. More of the chewy than flaky-and-crumble-all-over-your-face type. not bad at all but the cheese was unnecessary in this pairing.Decor is so homey (with the cutest menu illustrations on the wall), and there's a comfortable amount of natural light. Plus, the windows open, which, on that beautiful sunny day, made the afternoon perfecto. Seating is very intimate but doesn't get overly loud. Totally would love to have this as my corner coffee shop.
A really great lunch spot. Every time we have come here we had to wait for a seat because it's really popular.  Has a good atmosphere and the food is worth the wait.
Aside from the long line ups and crowded tables, it's worth coming here to eat for their superb sandwiches! If you come too late, some menus will be sold out, so be early!! Take out also available if you don't want to wait in line.
My previous time in Montreal, I unfortunately walked in right at closing time. This time around I made it a point to stop by, even risking missing my flight. Was it worth it? Oui Oui Absolutely! Had the cubain, which can only be discriminated as a fancy upscale Cuban. What a great delicious take on a classic sandwich. The menu is filled with inventive interpretations. It's no wonder the place is always filled to the brim
I absolutely love this place. I was there years ago but still remember how quaint and cozy and warming this place was. The service was super friendly and the food was on par. I'm planning on going back next year and this is my first stop when I go back.
An Mtl classic. Probably one of the better places to do breakfast/brunch/lunch in the Old Port. Many good options - I like their housemate salty ricotta. Decent coffee. Price is not high but certainly not the best deal in town. I still love coming here on Sat AMs w my daughter (we're neighbours ;-))The staff is friendly and hip. Lovely atmosphere.
What a beautiful, cozy place! The food is delicious; the salads and sandwiches are always my choice and the pastry are just perfect for my usual cappuccino! I love the vibe of the place; the moment you take your seat at the table, the day becomes better, surrounded with those beautiful smells of coffee and toasted bread and muffins :)The service is perfect, it always comes with a smile and with the answers and suggestions you need!
So delicious and fresh! I got The Big Healthy Salad with a side of avocado, and my mom got the housemade ricotta served with fresh toasts and a tomato/corn salad. Very cozy and welcoming atmosphere...definitely a must-go lunch spot.
Had breakfast here on a weekday. Very busy and crowded. I enjoyed the food.Food: 4/5, got the panini with poached egg and meat. Spicy, warm and very delicious.Service: 2/5, lacklustre, felt a bit rushed and the tables and seats were not very comfortable.Ambience: 3/5, nice little place with cool decor.Price: 2/5, overpriced for what you get; somewhat odd for Montreal but it could because they have buzz. Not sure about the $5 lemonade lol.
The-best-place in Montreal for breakfast and brunch. Oh wow, I still remember the taste of their numerous and beautiful pastries I tried with my boyfriend. Flaky, buttery, fruity deliciousness in buns, croissants, danishes and donuts. Everything was delicious and I wish I tried everything else. Place was super busy when we got there so we grabbed food to go instead. Get there early if you want to sit down or be prepare to wait.
Stumbled across this amazing place while exploring the port. As soon as we walked in, we were blown away with the atmosphere and decor. The first thing we saw were the croissants, which certainly made our mouths water. They looked so good, that we ended up getting 3 (cheese, almond and chocolate) and all were just as amazing as they looked. My boyfriend got the "egg on your face" sandwich. I'm not a huge fan of spicy food (which this sandwich was) so I didn't get one of my own, but decided to try it once it came out. I loved it so much that I ended up eating half of my boyfriends sandwich. Seriously one of the best sandwiches I've tasted in a while. Food was delicious and coffee was fantastic. Service was excellent as well. Certainly a must-try when you're in Montreal.
What a great place for fresh baked good, good coffee and excellent brunch. The menu is delicous - we tried almost all of it and i was pleasantly impressed. It's got all the ingredients of a traditional brunch - but it's turned into something modern, pseudo healthy and something to think about all day really.Come early, or cross you fingers, or sweet talk every person who works there.
Outstanding bakery.Excellent for breakfast or lunch.  Salad and  sandwich listings are a bit limited, but you are bound to find something you like.  The baked products are some of the best I have tasted.  The lines can be long on the weekend...so get there expecting to wait.
Food is amazing, so it's always -always- packed, I guess that could justify to some extent why the staff seems overworked and stressed out. Don't expect service with a smile, especially from the cashiers. If you are willing to sacrifice a friendly service for great food then it's definitely worth a visit.
Super cute cafe with a great menu and wonderful staff. On a Saturday around lunch, we waited for about 10 minutes for a table, which I have to say I'm quite fine with. I wouldn't want to bring a big group here though, since I heard them quoting waits of closer to 45 minutes to people with more than about 4 people.We both had paninis, which were very good. I think that if I ever came back here, I would want to try something a little more interesting, but that's not because the paninis were bad - there were just so many great things on the menu. A little pricey, but I think it's just since the whole area seems pretty upscale.I didn't get any baked goods, but I totally lusted after them, and I would for sure try some if I came back.
Out of all the restaurants I visited over the long weekend...Olive & Gourmando was one of my favourites. We dined here on our first day in Montreal and we ordered take-out on the last day of our trip. ;)As we were one block away from Olive & Gourmando on Thursday morning, we could smell something delicious. By the time we reached the corner of Saint Pierre and Saint Paul, there were already a few people patiently waiting for the restaurant to open. The moment the clock struck 8, we were welcomed with smiling faces as the door swung open. With a comfy, rustic vibe and a counter filled with freshly baked goods, stepping into Olive and Gourmando first thing in the morning was delightful.My boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed the "Poached Egg On Your Face" Panini. Sriracha in a breakfast sandwich? Yes, please! It was a bit greasy, but delicious -- deliciously crunchy and cheesy with a bit of a kick.I am a chocoholic, and I couldn't leave Olive & Gourmando without trying a brioche, the Brioche au Chocolat Valrhona in particular. The moment I took my first bite, I died and went to chocolate heaven... The brioche was nice and warm, soft, and VERY chocolatey! I LOVE chocolate but even I think it may be a bit too chocolatey sweet for breakfast. It worked out nicely that my boyfriend and I shared something savoury and something sweet.Before heading back home, we stopped by Olive & Gourmando again. This time, it was right around noon and there was a bit of a line, filled with both tourists and locals, waiting to be seated. We decided to just order take-out and ended up getting five Chocolate and Banana & Chocolate brioches to bring back home. I'm not a fan of bananas, but I was told the Banana Chocolate Brioche was amazing as well.If you are in the area, and/or you are looking for a place that offers good sandwiches and pastries, why not? It may be a little pricey, but I'm pretty certain I'll return anyway, to try their lunch menu and other pastries next time I'm in Montreal again.
Best place to go for lunch. It's always packed, which is a good sign, so I just walk to the back and order lunch to go. Their soups are tasty and salads, really good. Haven't had their pastries yet, try to resist, but they look like the best things I've seen in Montreal. Great service, good food, great atmosphere, decent price, I will be back.Love this place!
Came here with a friend during a weekend stroll. The place was packed! And it was 3pm on a weekend! Luckily, we were able to grab seats by the windows. The place is definitely cozy, but it gives off a really nice vibe throughout the surroundings. I had the Cuban sandwich and it was so good! The sandwich temperature was probably close to burning, but it makes all the difference when it's freshly made. My friend told me this was the best sandwich place in Montreal - and I don't doubt her words. There is a large variety of other sandwiches, so I would definitely return to try new items. I also saw many baked goodies (pastries!).Service was alright - A little slow, maybe sitting in a corner was a bad idea. I don't really remember interacting with the waitress much, since she appeared to have many other tables she was managing. The one thing that probably carved an impression on me was the table spacing. I remember seeing other customers trying to find ways to leave their seats without having to step on anyones toes....Other than that, the place is definitely worth a visit!
Your quintessential bakery cafe on Montreal. We had the ricotta marmalade on fresh toast and the egg panini with sriracha that complimented the desire for sweet and salty!  We were definitely happy with the food and service. Upon exiting, you can just get up and pay at the counter without the need to wait for your server. This is a plus for me!
This was one of our favorite stops in Montreal! Seriously, such a hopping eatery, even on a tuesday. But the wait is worth it! I love the space and liveliness inside. We shared their beet soup and cuban sandwich. The soup was so so good. A swirl of olive oil, dill and feta cheese made it delicious. And the sandwich was done well too: hot, gooey cheese and turkey between two slices of crunchy panini bread.We also bought some pastries to go - the almond croissant, two scones and a blueberry danish. The blueberry danish was the best. The pastries were good, but not amazing.
We went for lunch on a busy day. It was packed but we were served quite fast! The Gustavo sandwiches were delicious! The waiter even took the time to check if everything was okay. Great place.
Wonderful, must try spot in Old Montreal.Getting this out of the way up front..The three negatives that are somewhat minor are...1. You will wait and wait for a table on a nice weekend.2. Service is only ok. They are so busy that you may be overlooked at times.3. No coffee refills. The coffee is 3$, your meal is over $15, but no refills on coffee.Beyond that...1. The Cuban and egg in your face paninis are both delicious and of a respectable size.2. The chocolate brioche bun (as well as the blueberry) are a meal in themselves. I suggest splitting one of these if you are also having something else! This is one of the best sweet treats I have eaten in a long time.3. The fresh fruit bowl with yogurt is super fresh and delicious.4. The decor in here is fun. The chandelier (made out of vines) is cool, as are all the chalkboard drawings and general feel of the space.You have to eat here. Overall, it is a bit pricey, but the food and experience are worth it. Just go slow on the coffee.
Service: Great, though we had to wait for about 20 min. It was a Saturday afternoon around 4 pm. This may be why it was so busy.Food: Really excellent. My date had an excellent sandwich and my salad was delicious. Everything was local and organic, always a plus in my book.Atmosphere: Really loud, but cool and trendy.Pricing: Slightly overpriced, but when you consider the quality of the ingredients, it may be the right price-point.
Tasty food, nice decor, good quality ingredients - the poached eggs in your face panini is very yummy. (But you have to go early because they sell out quickly - around noon, they should stock up on more of those so that we don't have to rush to go early!)The only thing that sucks is the lineup/wait time because it's not a big café, hence the 4 instead of 5 stars. it's not cheap, but I'd rather pay a little bit more for something good than get something cheap that tastes cheap.. After all it's unlikely that you'll find something in old Montreal that is good and cheap.
Good food and good service! You should know the place gets real crowded during lunch hours on weekdays.I really like their lunch menu, their breakfast menu could be better, maybe some more savory options.
Dropped in for breakfast before heading to the airport and it was a fitting end to a great food experience in Montreal.  - Homemade "Sweet" RicottaThe ricotta came with honey, orange zest and sea salt, served w/ toast.  Thought it could've come w/ a little more honey to balance out for each bite.  Could be preference, but by the end, only had the ricotta on toast left over, which was good by its own right - "Poached egg on your face" PaniniProbably my favorite dish of the morning, the bread had a satisfying crunch on the outside w/ a soft interior.  The cheese and egg melts in your mouth, complimented by the siracha for a spicy kick.  The menu says a speck of pork, but there was a decent amount of pig in there.  Maybe speck means something different in Canada...- Butter CroissantCrispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, done perfectly.- Apple TurnoverNot too sweet, with the brown sugar coating gave it an extra crunch.- Chocolate-Banana BriocheSo flavorful but extremely dense.  Not necessarily a bad thing, but you could probably get full just off of the brioche, so beware when ordering.
Got the cuban sandwich and it was a lot better than some of the cuban sandwiches I've had at cuban restaurants. Also got a chocolate chip and pecan cookie from their pastries section and it was amazing. The portion size is just good enough that a little dessert afterwards puts you in a good spot. Place was very busy on a Wednesday afternoon, but we were seated within 15 minutes.
tourist trap through and through!i headed down this morning to old montreal on my little workout bike ride and decided to stop at O&G since i was already there and figure that at 9am, it wouldn't be too bad. how mistaken i was. not only was the place already jam packed but the wait time was about 45 minutes long and it was only 9am on a fucking friday. ok, its the long weekend. understandable.so making my way through for some takeout which is what you should be doing unless you want to sit. while i was waiting to order, i took a good look at their baked goods. they looked delicious but the price, you better be the best and to be frank, its hard to top Guillaume.anyway, since i already munch on some buttery goods earlier, i only got a coffee, a small cappuccino to go. how's the coffee?for one, it's THE priciest coffee out there! it's starbucks pricing and it's very starbucks tasting. in short, CRAP! beans are from pilot coffee roasters which is decent to quite good depending where you go. for example, Odessa near little italy uses amongst other pilot coffee and they do it right.that coffee came in piping hot, somehow lacking in flavor and above all, it's cortado sizing at tourist pricing. when you compare, its almost 2 italian caffè or one very generous dispatch or l'artiste affamé latté.service took forever despite lineup not being that long. compare to Olimpico on a sunny summer weekend day, that lineup is a joke yet takes longer to be serve than Olimpico.the only redeeming factor for the place is you're getting everything in one single stop. for the lazy, go ahead but for those who wants what Montreal does best, you're better off hitting the eclectic charming neighborhoods up north.and for those who wants a similar experience to O&G but cheaper? head straight to Hof Kelsten. its a very similar concept
We had a very nice quick lunch at this well located establishment in the heart of the old town of Montreal.  The pace is fast and reminds me of the quick serve restaurants in Los Angeles.  We had their Cajun chicken sandwich (so big that we split it).  Was very delicious and the pineapple was a great touch.  We also shared a delicious cheese croissant and this delicious sugary fried croissant type thing that I can't remember the name of as of this review.  Only thing weird was their iced tea was sooooo small, almost like a shot.
Stopped in around 2pm on a Saturday. This place was hopping! 35min wait for a table. Luckily those that don't want to wait can either order take out, or you can purchase their bakery items. Latte was amazing, panini was fantastic! Service was very polite and quick. Would definitely go back.
Whether you're vegan, vegetarian, or a carnivore (me), Olive & Gourmando redefines what wholesome, homemade food should be.
On our visit to Montreal, we stopped by this place around 3pm [during a winter storm] and it was packed to the brim. We eventually got a table and ordered the chicken/bean/cilantro/cheese soup as well as the Ginger Ice Tea, The Gustavo panini, Goat Cheese Risotto, and [a twist on the] Mac 'n' Cheese. The food was classic artisan yum, the flavours bountiful, and the presentation... earthy --- simply what the palate needed. We finished everything -- even the random sliced almond from the green salad. Worth. It.
Delish, hip, happening and fresh. Worth the wait but it can be so hard to sit tight on a cold winter's day!
So excellent, highly recommend. Pricing here is pretty reasonable and for the quality you get, you'll be pleasantly surprised! I got a cuban panini, and it was toasty and melty and crunchy in all the right ways. My friend ordered a specialty salad (it was a lot of grains and fresh vegetables) that was superb. Their latte was also very good. This is a must-visit in Old Montreal, and if I'm ever in Montreal again, I'm going to come visit.
This is one of my favorite late lunch spots in Montreal. However, I mention late because this place is very busy and the wait list is long! No reservations. The interior is welcoming and cozy.For beverages, you must try their home made lemonade, it is simply delicious and refreshing.  Their mocha coffee is very good too. For meals, my favorite is The Cubain, it's porc and pancetta with a Gruyere cheese. In the fall, their Mac N Cheese is very good too. I personally also love a side of their green salad - it has a distinct taste that at first I was not so crazy about but it has grown on me since then and I love it! And, a must try at the end of your meal to complete everything is their brownie - so moist and simply to die for! Prices are pricey but well worth it on a gorgeous day! (About $50-$60 for 2 people for lunch.)
Arrived around noon on a Saturday and there were at least 15 people waited to be seated. We gave our name for the wait list and was told 5-10 minutes. The wait was only a few minutes for a shared table which was fine with us. The place is super cozy and love the fresh baked goods on display. We both got paninis which were buttery, and quite filling. I thought both were too salty though. The first few bites were great, but it quickly got too heavy. Next time, will opt of the salad and split the hot dog.
I LOVED this place! It was one of my favorites in Montreal for brunch. My fiancee and I went there on a snowy morning, which made it a romantic setting looking out on the streets of Old Montreal. The decor is great, the pastries are delicious and their presentation is lovely. I was a bit bummed because I wanted to try their poached egg in your face sandwich and they were out. I ended up getting the sweet ricotta with orange zest and honey instead (YUM!!!) and my fiancee had a chicken panini, which he said was one of the best paninis he has ever had. That is a bold statement from him! We also had their chocolate banana brioche and the maple pecan brioche, both were AMAZING. Trust me, this place won't disappoint. But be prepared for a wait, the place was packed, rightfully so!
I would rate this a 5, but for a couple of quirks. I will definitely go again when next in Montreal.Two of us had the house made ricotta with honey and toast. Adult and child both loved it.I had the bufala maple yogurt with fruit. It was perfect. Maybe 8-10 types of fruit chopped tiny with the delicious yogurt. Quirk: happy accident as this was not exactly what I had ordered. When I got to the bottom of the bowl and had not encountered the granola, I really didn't care as it was that good.One had the egg on your face panini which she enjoyed, but found the spicy warning out of place.The croissants, plain and almond, were much enjoyed by mother and child.Quirk: for $4.50 each I would expect the hot chocolate to be made with milk. They were bitter dark chocolate and watery. The children and adults agreed that even with added sugar, these were disappointing.
We were visiting from Toronto. Had excellent food. Each item was delicious. Being a vegetarian in Montreal is not an easy task. But we had excellent vegetarian lunch. They tend to run out of few meals. Still excellent food and service.
Near-perfect. The setup is unique, ordering your way through what is Montreal's most unique gourmet cafeteria. The food is divine - tons for the vegetable lover, sandwich aficionado, or soup slurper. Prices range, but you don't have to be loaded to eat there. Perfect to run into on a cold Montreal day, for a pastry and a coffee - or a warm meal. Rush hours will see a line form, probably worth up to a 15 minute wait....unless you're freezing and it's winter...in which case, find a coffee shop and wait it out there!
We ate here recently on a trip to Montreal. We stopped in for a late lunch, but the place was still hopping. W/o a reservation we were able to get a table in about 10-15 minutes. I had the Cuban panini and the hubs had the cold chicken sandwich. Both were tasty and pretty filling and large portions. We opted for dessert, but I kind of wish we hadn't. While the desserts looked very appealing, the almond croissant and chocolate brioche, they were a little dry and we didn't finish either. Overall, this is a great place to stop for a quick bite in the Old City.
Good, but pricey and a little strange. We waited for about 45 minutes for a table for two, so obviously this place is popular. You are packed in, basically sitting shoulder to shoulder with the person next to you. We got fussed at for putting our jackets in the window sill (a little strange), so we had jackets piled on the backs of our chairs. I ordered the Cuban, which was delicious, but pricey at over $10 without any sides. I asked for a side of chips, and all they have are full size bags of chips made for multiple people... So it became close to $20 for a sandwich and chips. Like I said, the food was delicious, but it's pricey for what you get and you don't have much space.
Amazing Cuban sandwich and salads, worth the wait! The coffee and chai are also very good!
We stopped in for lunch at Olive & Gourmando after checking out the Phi Center next door (great place, btw!). We had a short wait for a table which is to be expected at exactly noon on a Tuesday. I ordered the Cajun Chicken sandwich and was told that since they were out of mango, it would be served with pineapple instead, yum! Husband ordered the Cuban Sandwich and a cup of the soup du jour which was Tomato Meatball. We were both very impressed with our meals! I would have preferred to have my sandwich heated up, but it was still delicious cold. Our waiter was very pleasant and the serve was quite quick considering the place was completely packed! This is definitely on the list of places to return to next time we are in town!
My boyfriend and I found this place on Yelp while blindly looking for paninis near our apartment during our stay in Old Montreal. We came for a late lunch around 2pm on a Wednesday, so we were luckily seated right away. The place has a very trendy, eccentric vibe and a unique menu. At first we were hesitant about some of the menu items (a panini with pickle mayo?), but decided to order the Cubain and Pomodoro paninis to split since they were most appealing to us.I am not exaggerating when I say there are the best sandwiches I've ever eaten. The Pomodoro got better with every bite, the perfect mix of salty and savory. As the for the Cubain, I would choose this as my last meal. The variety of flavors fused together into one and somehow really worked together. We also ordered two cappuccinos which were also very good. The server was very friendly and accommodating.We enjoyed our food so much that we even came back and ordered two more paninis to go for our long road trip back to the US. It was a Friday afternoon around 12:30pm, and although it was raining, the line was out the door. I'd recommend coming late afternoon to avoid the rush and really enjoy the meal! Definitely don't miss this stop in Montreal.
Their bread is like a carb pillow or fluffy dough cloud. If you've tried it, this is the prefect analogy. I'm not high.Sandwich menu is made of heaven. I waiver between the Viva Las Vegan and Cubano. Sweets spread is everything you could want and your ass is afraid of.I wish they had more salad options. Everyone has faults.Espresso is lovely. Lunchtime line is hell. Going during off times is cool and it is worth the wait. I hate lines so I mean it when I say it is worth the time.Always bustling.
They were so unpleasant seating us that we simply walked out.Went across the street for a great breakfast at the Portuguese place.
It is so clear once you visit O&G why it is such a fan favorite on Yelp. We visited for an early lunch on a Wednesday during the winter and the place was abuzz. There is a nicely curated arrangements of tables and seats, but despite the busyness, we did not wait more than five minutes for a seat. Service was solid as many people attended to us while we were there. I started with a latte which was perfect for the grey day outside. There were so many options on the menu that appealed to me, but ended up with The Gustavo panini that had chicken, portobello mushroom, balsamic, maple mustard, cheese.. man, it was killer. A lot of their verbiage in the restaurant/cafe speak to their food being 'homemade' and 'made with love' and that is so apparent. When you are done you walk up and cash out at the counter which is very smart. They have you wait in a line that forms along a beautifully arranged counter of delicious pastries, cookies and sweets. If my sandwich hadn't filled me up to the top, I could have impulse bought one of everything. I highly recommend a visit to this clear local and tourist favorite.
Worth the line up. This is a pretty small cafe so a wait is pretty much guaranteed(especially if its on a weekend). However unlike kazu, you'll usually be seated in less than 20 mins.   I tried the cuban panini while my friends both had the cajun chicken sandwich. I was told the cuban panini is a must try at olive and gourmando so i wanted to see what the fuss was all about. The waiter was extremely nice despite how busy the restaurant is and repeated fill up our water. The food also came within reasonable time, or maybe we were just too busy catching up. Boy, was the panini good. The cheese, the pork, the lime and chipotle all came together perfectly. DEFINITELY WORTH THE HYPE. I was told that my friend's sandwiches were also both excellent. The portion is extremely generous, although i didn't hesitate to finish it all in one sitting.   Great place to catch up over brunch, and bonus ? a nice walk around old port after the meal.
Everything Olive & Gourmando makes is good! Their sandwiches are just so good, especially the Cuban one. Good selection of tea and sweets too! If you happen to go for brunch on the weekend, try to get there when they open, so you don't have to wait. It gets really busy, but it is worth the wait.
Adore the atmosphere and decor of this little shop! Very busy but still managed to snag a cozy table for 2 during lunch hour.  We had the pomme de luxe panini and Caesar salad, both fresh and well seasoned!  Staff was kind and attentive.  Slightly on the expensive side (e.g. $4 for espresso) but enjoyed the whole experience!
C'est bon!friday morning brunch- decaf latte, cubain panini et butter croissant.the cubain panini is warm and tasty, with delicious Italian bacon and cheese. Highly recommend. The latte is okay, not outstanding. But it neutralizes the strong taste of the panini.The croissant could be better.Very crowded even though we arrived by 11.Service is good.Will visit again.
Their grilled cheese is RIDICULOUS. As are all of the soups.
Pastries here are a little bit pricy, but it definitely worth it. Best palmier and best chocolate brownie that tastes like Japanese red beans dessert. Eggs on your face panini is the best panini I've ever had! Every time I went there, I had to wait like 30 minutes. Always busy there!
snoby and expensive place for tourists, but its sure fresh and somewhat creative there's no waiters though love the sandwhiches if im a tourist id be so happy to sit there and watch the crowd in old port unfortunately i am a local and can find better places
We visited during non peak hours, it was around 1-2pm so we easily grabbed a table with no problems. Cute little place, great energy and nice staff. The Cuban panini was killer and the shrimp and crab salad hit the spot! A bit pricey for what you get but the quality is there.
So, so, SO cute that I wanted to love it but just couldn't. The breakfast food is fine, but not special enough to make up for the crowds and blasé service. The menu is pricey for what it is.I found the coffee to be a bit astringent. (Many people were drinking tea, so maybe I should have taken the hint.) The homemade granola with yogurt was average, but the sweet ricotta with toast was a nice change from the usual. The lunch offerings look more interesting, so maybe I was expecting too much for breakfast.O&G was recommended by everyone, but I'm beginning to think that that was part of the problem: a victim of its own success.
We came across this and it was a gem of a find. Great atmosphere. The menu is great and very unique and the food was so delicious. We had the chicken salad with the "salty " ricotta and soup. So good.
I wanted an authentic breakfast and I found it! (or at least I think I did) Yelp led me to Olive and Gourmando and it did not disappoint! I ordered tea and it came in a teapot and everything. The chocolate croissant was delicious and so were the other couple baked goods we tried. Also, I am not remembering the name, but there was a panini (only one on the menu) that was incredible - a perfectly warm, lightly meaty, mega-cheesey panini! And who wouldn't love their slogan, "eat, drink, be merry."
Awesome lil crowded cafe in Old Montreal serving YUMM Sandwiches & baked Goodies. They say makin the beast with two backs  is biochemically no different from eating large quantities of chocolate. I'd say its biochemically no different than havin the delicious Sandwiches or patisserie @ O&G.  Nuff said........... Food -  GreatService - Fast & friendlyAmbiance - Casual / Cozy / CrowdedWorth the money -Yisss
Visited Montreal for the long weekend and had a great lunch here. The line was crazy long but well worth the wait. Food is delicious and staff are attentive. They can easily accommodate gluten free. Their soup of the day was amazing. I'll be back.
1. The WaitWe arrived at 11 am on a Saturday morning. There was a line that was out the door when we arrived and the place was packed. We were told the wait was at least 15 min, I think we were seated in 5 - sweet!2. The OrderAfter reviewing the fairly short menu, it was time to order. Poached eggs pls? We're sold out. Some OJ pls? We're also sold out. This was disappointing because what kind of breakfast places runs out of eggs and oranges? I didn't have the heart to show my disappointment as the waiter was accommodating and quickly got us the lunch menu as we didn't find anything else we really felt like ordering on the breakfast menu. 3. The FoodI end up ordering the Cubain panini from the lunch menu and the regular green salad as they didn't offer side salads. The salad for $7 was worth it. It was a nice portion for $7 - all fresh ingredients. They've got their own twist on this salad though, there are some fairly strong smelling herbs that make up a good portion of the salad. Unfortunately, I couldn't identify them as something I'm familiar with. There were some almonds, but other than that, it's a pretty no frills salad which was what I was looking for. The Cubain panini tasted great and comes in a fairly large portion. Great flavours and sauce! Is this going to be the best panini you've had in your life? Probably not, but it's darn good and up there. Lastly, my friend go the banana chocolate brioche to go which is supposedly their most famous pastry. We ended up eating this a little later in the afternoon, it tasted nice and chocolatey, but as far as the banana taste goes, we couldn't really find it. Perhaps it was just too much chocolate. 4. The DrinkNo OJ right? So I order the "elixir" some sort of green tea + ginger + ?one last thing I can't remember? Well seeing that I can't remember the last ingredient means I didn't taste it. In fact, I'm pretty sure I didn't taste any ginger either. As far as green teas go, there was a strong green tea taste. Overall, I felt completely ripped off by this drink even though it only cost $4.50.
The breakfast panini was really greasy, kind of too spicy and flavourless. I wanted to love this place SO BADLY. It was so pretty, the people were nice, the location is so quaint and cute. Gosh I'm really disappointed.I will give it another shot and try a banana chocolate something or another...
This place is great for sandwiches but prepare to wait in line! I highly recommend the paninis because they are AWESOMELY CRISPY! I also really like the ice tea even though it's pricey. While you wait you can always walk around and look at some galleries at Old Port.
Quick friendly service, but not rushed.  The food and espresso drinks were great!  I will go back.
We go out of our way to go here every time we visit Montreal (in fact we've booked hotels just so that they're within walking distance).  It can get pretty crowded especially on weekends for brunch and it looks like it is very popular with locals.  The decor and service are both wonderful, really cosy right in the heart of old montreal.  I've been getting the egg-on-your-face sandwich (basically a panini with ham and cheese and a poached egg plus some sriracha on it) since I first went there five years ago.  It has been consistently excellent as are all their pastries.  Great selection of teas and coffees too.
We were so taken with Olive & Gourmando on our visit to Montreal that we went back again, and definitely thought about doubling back to Montreal from Quebec City later in our trip just to visit it again.The almond croissants are out of this world. They're just unbelievably good. The salads are wonderful, as well. But let me extol the virtues of a couple of the sandwiches we had.  The Cubain is a hugely memorable roasted port panini with gruyere, lime, chipotle, cilantro and mayo. This sandwhich just launched me into heaven. The chipotle especially gave this panini such a wondrous flavor. The Cajun Chicken sandwich was just an unexpected delight. I didn't come to Montreal to try "Cajun" anything, but the spices worked so well with the fresh ingredients on this sandwich that it was a toss-up which of the two sandwiches I planned to order again on my next visit. We'll definitely return when we come back to Montreal.Be prepared for long lines at lunch time unless you come early. This eatery's reputation is well earned. Apparently, everything on the menu tastes delicious.
I have honestly never been to a less accommodating restaurant.  OK, look, I know that I have some quirky-ish dietary restrictions (mostly vegetarian, slow-carb/low carb), but I'm not particularly fussy and every restaurant I've ever been to (sans this one) has been able to accommodate. So, there's a salad on the menu that looks like it will fit the bill, but it's served on noodles.  Can I get it with just more greens and no noodles?  No, we can't do that.  Can you take your regular greens salad and add vegetables (that are on the menu for other dishes)?  No.  How about the salad and some of the smoked trout from a smoked trout sandwich (I'll pay for both).  No - we can bring you the sandwich and you can scrape it off yourself.  What??  Really??Ended up with a simple greens salad that was at least 50% parsley (wow, lovely).  And, for the rest of the party (who ordered stock menu items), nothing was actually very good.  (Nothing was horrible, mind you, just not worth the trip here.)  It was, however, VERY expensive and there was an extra serving of hipster pretension thrown in for good measure. (Oh, I won't even mention the wait for all this pretension because, after all, one does know what one is getting into when you see the line.)Finally, it's not even as if there was even a bit of apology from the waiter for the absolute refusal to alter any dish in any way - just an offhanded, "we're a busy restaurant."  Got it.  You're very important, we're just the customers.
The first time I went here I loved it. I don't know what happened the second time. Its gotten much more busy and maybe I just didn't like what I ordered? Limited vegetarian options and I ended up with something rather plain. It was basically a grilled cheese with homemade ketchup. The ketchup was sooo clove-y. Really not my thing, clove flavoured dishes should come with a warning! Not worth waiting in line for. I do love their sound system and decor though.
We were a party of three and shared a fall beet salad, the salted ricotta salad and a goat cheese hot panini.The food didn't last very long as it was delicious. The menu very much reflects the seasons and its options are extremely fresh tasting and masterfully put together.You have to try this place!
I have to admit, trying to get into the doorway of this cute brunch place is quite hectic.There is barely enough room to stand in the cramped entrance, whether you're just going for a pastry to-go or waiting for a seat. I arrived with two friends, and we were told the wait was going to be twenty minutes (this was at noon). We decided to wait. There's a continuous traffic of customers flying in and out the door. Olive et Gourmando has a lively ambience and warm atmosphere once you get to sit back and enjoy it. I've previously had the hot chocolate her (thick, bitter, rich; only downside was the incredibly small size of the cup) but today I was here to try a sit-down meal. I ordered the goat cheese panini with caramelized onions ($9.50) served with house made ketchup. It didn't take long to arrive, and was served hot and fresh. It met my expectations, yet I still regret not trying something sweet from the breakfast menu.I tried my friend's mac and cheese ($17 and served with salad). I found it salty, and I expected a bigger portion for the price. I must say, O +G is a place to enjoy a comfortable, satisfying meal. Nothing blew me away, but I had a nice experience here (except the first bit; trying to get into the restaurant!)
I have been going to OG for years. I have always loved the menu. The chill ambiance. There is a bit of a wait. It seems all the tourist have found out about this place as it was in a Montreal Tourist book as well as recommended by a lot of concierges. It's worth the wait. I always take the Cajun chicken with mango tomato guacamole on nan bread with a side of green salad. Mixed greens toasted almonds red onions and cashew dressing. Love their Cuban sandwich so cheesy and greasy. Their house cesar salad with chicken is so good hopefully they will bring it back. Love their raspberry lemonade. I always have two of those! Their cappuccinos are so creamy. For dessert try the brownies they have a hint of espresso it seems. It's a great cafe they also have a different menu for breakfast which I tried once but didn't really like the egg sandwich I would stick to yogurt and fruits. If you want to avoid the rush go around 11am-12pm or 5pm. They are closed on Sundays and Mondays. They are not open late.
It's near old port. When we arrived the sandwiches sold out. we ordered Soup of the day and Caesar salad and  panini. The soup is made of green beans it is So delicious but a little bit cold in a rainy cold day. The panini is crazy salty I had.
We were at Olive et Gourmando early enough to beat the crowd and got seated right away. If I had to wait for a table, it might be a 3 star review.Great place for breakfast, as nothing beat some good pastry and coffee.We shared a Chocolate & Banana Brioche and a plain Croissant. Cappuccino was A OK though on the more mellow side.The tables are packed so closely together, not much privacy. Olive et Gourmando is good for something fast, but a place that you can really take your time and enjoy your food. By the time we were leaving, there was so many people blocking the entrance waiting for a table. I don't mind coming back for more treats or coffee but I doubt I would have wanted to wait for more than 10-15 minute for a table on on my vacation
Very busy at lunch time. You can go in and order to go which I did the second time I went... Found a spot in the sun a block down and enjoyed a little picnic. Loved the eggplant soup with feta and salsa verde. I will dream about that soup. Also I'm not vegan but loved the marinated roasted tofu on flatbread. Chocolate and banana brioche to die for.
This is a declaration of love for Olive et Gourmando! Located in the heart of Montreal, Olive et Gourmando has established themselves as a quintessential cafe of Old Montreal. Delicious breakfast items...piping hot Panini...fresh cold sandwiches...a table stacked with amazing baked goods as far as the eyes can see....what more can Hungarians (not to be confused with the good people of Hungary; but rather, hungry patrons) ask for? The flavor profile of the apple and parsnip soup with julienned pear covered with crispy bacon was truly divine. Needless to say, it was devoured within seconds. The #24 Salad must be sent by the Herbivore God.  The amazingly competent dish is comprised of the following: buckwheat soba noodles tossed with sesame oil, toasted unsweetened coconut, black sesame seeds, pickled daïkon and carrots, fried shallots, roasted marinated tofu, fresh herbs (basil, mint, cilantro), peas, fenugreek sprouts, red cabbage, cucumber, strips of kale, mixed sprouted beans, and mix seeds and nuts (small pieces of roasted unsalted cashew).The equally marvelous dressing consisted of rice wine vinegar, fresh ginger, organic cashew butter, some spicy chili sauce, sautéed onion, garlic, curry powder, cinnamon, cumin, fresh coriander and fresh lime juice."Am I dead, Angel? Cause this must be heaven!" O + G, I'd use cheesier pick-up line on you, but you're too smart for it.
Tried to go back two days in a row it was that good, unfortunately it was closed on Sunday. By the time we got there they were out of their famous poached egg Panini, so we went with the Cajun spiced chicken with guacamole, mango and roasted tomato. One of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Husband and I also split an almond croissant which was nothing short of incredible, and the lattes and drip coffee were great as well. HIGHLY recommend, the wait to eat here is worth it.
Finally, good coffee in Montreal! And the orange juice was what you imagine fresh squeezed juice should look like, but ought to be for $5.50/glass.The restaurant is on a really quaint, narrow street with other cafes and boutiques.The hot sandwiches were really tasty, but a little greasy (which can be a problem in a city that's so tight on napkins...).The cajun chicken sandwich was excellent - fresh and delicious. This is a cold sandwich, so not greasy. The bread was really unique - like the thin outer layer of a light focaccia.On the down side: no refills on $3 drip coffee; sandwiches ($10-12) are a little on the pricier side for Montreal cafes; the check machine calculates % tip on the total bill (including tax), so just be aware.
It's definitely a long wait, but if you go during off hours, it's not horrible.  You are seated. You order. You eat.  You pay at the register in the front. The mixed garden salad is full of beautiful green leafy herbs and various greens and toasted almonds, and great dressing. The Reuben sandwich is wonderfully crispy with nice Jewish meat. It's not the same as Katz but it's still a solid hot panini.
Their "Poached egg on your face" panini (a hint of sriracha sauce, though optional) is excellent and quite a change from your normal breakfast.
Olive et Gourmando is always a great place to grab a late lunch (it gets crazy busy between 11-2) but its worth even getting take-out. The last time I was there, I ordered the cuban sandwich and the creamy cauliflower soup of the day, both were just so delicious, flawless even. Service is always fantastic. Cozy, cute, friendly and has a local feeling rather than a touristy feeling despite it being in Old Montreal.
I really can't say more that hasn't already been said about this place. Staff is kind and informative, food is to die for, bread is crisp outside, soft inside, fresh fresh fresh. Do yourself a solid and go....please.
Went there at 10am, there was waiting line at that time. So if you do not want to wait, go there early. Best almond croissant I have ever had, the poached egg sandwich is a little salty but good, try soup of the day. Service is great.
Even the local Montrealins love this place!!  AMAZING food, fast courteous service, and fun bistro atmosphere.My husband spent our honeymoon in Montreal and as world travelers and food snob(speaking of myself), I had high expectations of the foodie city. After two weeks, many meals, and some home cooked, Olive and Gourmando was my FAVORITE meal and bistro!Let me start off by saying the night we ventured in, a sewer main broke a block away thus shutting off the bistros water supply. In mid chaos, any reasonable human would understand to be greeted by a frazzled and short host. Contrary to that, the manager calmly explained the situation and offered to let us stay for a Sandwich. We had been walking all day and needed to use the toilet (which of course was out of order due to the water shut off.) We decided to come back for lunch two days later.And that may have been our best decision the whole trip! I ordered a cappuccino and a simple bowl of tomato soup. Let me start with the cappuccino. If you've read my other reviews, I'm a coffee snob. I am appreciative and polite but, I will not drink a bad coffee. This espresso was dark and smooth! To add some twinkle to my good impression I saw the barista "testing" the machine making sure the espresso tasted exactly how it should.The tomato soup was both rich in texture and flavor, creamy and fresh! It was topped with a feta, parsley pesto.  SO GOOD! Just the bowl of soup was filling enough and packed with warm cozy flavor.  My husband got a Rueben panini. Again, the best Reuben I have every tasted-and I happen to not be big on meat! It was perfectly balanced between salty and savory, piping hot filled with gooey cheese and fresh crisp home made bread. Yum! Of course, it doesn't help that these are all fresh ingredients as its Montreal, practically France!We took dessert to go to enjoy later on our travels. As someone who lived in Italy, I fond memories of chocolate filled brioche. :) Either I was brought back to a state of ecstasy, or it really was the best Chocolatey Parisian pastry I've eaten. The only con I have was I shared it with my husband. I really do enjoy this bistro and will say one last thing- they are very welcoming to tourists. So put on your best French, our at least a big smile with your English and go eat some amazing food.
No wifi here! But it's okay. Per the server's joking suggestion, I forgot about the wifi and seized an opportunity to socialize. I made friends with a fellow entrepreneur who was also from the States. It was a great dining experience since we had an awesome view eating from the window bar-top. Those seats are perfect for people watching and passing time. The narrow alley ways of Old Port are interesting to be inside and to observe. Olive & Gourmando is a place to enjoy and savor. I easily had spent 2-hours there. I had a simple lunch: Latte, Cuban sandwich and then took some pastries to-go. They have a wide variety of baked goods on display that is hard to miss. So, don't skip!
Love, love, love! Such delicious food. Always worth the long wait.
Based on our lunch experience here.Service, the staff are very helpful, came by to remove dishes, ask for opinions and refills of drinks promptly.  No issues here.Decor/atmosphere, the place is nicely decorated but don't come here with a large group.  It seems like the ideal size is 2-3, 4 is okay but harder and any group that is 5 or more will likely have a long wait.Food, the food was okay.  I personally don't see why the reviews are so good, but it may just be a personal preference and that we had waited for over half an hour for a table and my expectations weren't met due to the wait.Price, we ordered a sandwich for about $12 and a green salad for $6.  The salad seems like a good size but the sandwich was a bit of a disappointment for me at $12.I wouldn't make my way out to come here again nor would it be a place that I would suggest to friends if they asked (the food was okay, nothing amazing as I have read).
I LOVE this place. LOVE IT. Go, you won't regret. In the summer, it's even better, take a stroll in the Old Port afterwards, bread or whatever else in hand, this will be unforgettable.
Came to Olive et Gourmando for a quick lunch near the Old Port.  The place was packed of people on a beautiful day. I found the layout to be a bit confusing, I guess that adds to the charm here.  Tables by the Pastry display, Tables near the bathroom door, Tables along the line to wait to make your order in the back, waiters squeezing by, patrons hitting the seated diners trying to squeeze by. It was Perfect chaos, it felt hip in some way, the tightness and the amount of Louis Vuitton bags I spotted.Waiters asked while waiting in line if we wanted to be seated, the wait was 20 mins for a table so I passed and ordered in the back.  The chalkboards on the top left display the fresh Sandwiches of the day that are already made. There are signs hanging under the menu items telling you ' Trop Tard ; Too Late!' Yep that good.I ordered the Brie and Caramelized onions, with a homemade ketchup compote $9.50 (I really wanted the chicken..sold out!). My fiancé ordered the Cuban Sandwich ; Cuban - pressed very thin with Pancetta, braised pork & Gruyere cheese $11  After making the order in the back you then go to the front to pay and the girls are making espressos and lattes, and bagging up treats for hungry sweet-toothed customers.  Couldn't resist buying the Huge Triple Chocolate Cookie.Then you wait. There are benches outside and in front of the cash.  People ordering coffees with need of sugar or stir sticks, have to excuse the waiting benched customers to move for their self-custom blended coffee, again chaos. There has to be a better layout or is this charm?We waited some time before our ready made sandwiches were put in a Press,  Cut in half , then Bagged without side of homemade Ketchup, the Huge Cookie, and some napkins for us to go. As we walked to our Hotel the bag started to get translucent from the grease, the deliciousness was screaming to get out, a great sign. The Brie had a generous portion of the cheese and melted on the caramelized onions it was perfection. No need for the ketchup but tried it anyways and it was good, it tasted like a fruit chutney. The Cuban was amazing. There was Pancetta, Braised pork, and Gruyere cheese a beautiful marriage. The Braised pork was unexpectedly the star to me and had soo much flavour it Made this sammie. The crunchy bites were increasingly tasty.I was full and tried the Triple chocolate cookie. Wow, the generous amounts of Real Chocolate chips is soo good, it was an experience, it did not disappoint!  I Love Chocolate.O&G set the bar high. The best sandwich we had and made others eaten from now on difficult to beat!A MUST must try if in the Old Port area
Excellent food! We didn't have reservations and had to wait about 20 mins for a table but it was worth it. Had the soup and a panini. Also tried the hot chocolate but found that to be a bit too bitter for my taste.
Delicious pastries! Although a bit pricey.
4.5 stars and 400+ reviews (in Canada!!) - this place HAD to be mind-blowing, right?? Umm.. Well.. It was good but I think there's at least a tiny bit of hype associated with it. We were told it would be a 20 min wait for lunch. In other circumstances I might've thought twice but this was O+G.. 20 mins was a blessing. Anyway, after about 25 mins, we were seated and my expectations were sky high at this point if that wasn't already obvious. I got what might be the most expensive thing on the menu - the Mac and cheese at about $19 while my husband got a chicken sandwich. Once our food arrived (tastefully plated in a rustic cafe way), I realized I was going to have to reset my expectation here. Mac and cheese was good but not $19 good. It came with a salad and that was fine too but again $19?? I thought my husband's chicken sandwich was better. Overall, the ambience of the place is very hipsterish but you are also seated shoulder to shoulder. I would probably give this a miss if I was visiting Montreal again given the number of other options in this foodie-town.
This restaurant is super cute and the food and drinks were delicious!  Even though the place was packed we were seated pretty quickly and the staff was very attentive and friendly, even during our wait for a table.  Everything here is made from scratch and we were all happy with our food and beverage choices. I would definitely recommend sharing a panini (big enough for 2 people) and a pastry item like their chocolate brioche.  The Latté was perfect and beautiful.
Cute bakery/eatery in beautiful old Montreal. Opt for the pastries instead of the savoury meal options. I tried the almond croissant $3.75 which was highly recommended but it was just ok in terms of a croissant. I loved the elixir ice tea, it's a green tea with ginger, lemon and pomegranate. It was the most delicious ice tea I've ever had  - complex yet balanced flavours and just a touch of sweetness. Only sad part is that the very small glass is $4.  I didn't love the egg on your face $11.95 - Spicy poached eggs with herbs and mayonnaise, Comté cheese, speck, and slow roasted tomatoes. The panini was just too heavy with the mayo and cheese for a breakfast item (for me at least) and the sriachha just over powered the eggs. I really wanted to like this place as it was so highly recommended but it didn't do it for me. Loved the ice tea and would return for that.
Came here because of their Yelp fame so I knew there was going to be a long wait. But I didn't expect there to be a line at the odd hour of 3:45 pm. Thankfully there are plenty of shops open nearby and a couple of galleries :) We got the almond croissant and apple turnover from their pastries rack. They were both good but not too impressive. The almond croissant could have been more crusty. I preferred the apple over the croissant. There weren't many other options for pastries as they have already sold out of many options. We also ordered the Cuban sandwich. Again, some of the other sandwich options have already sold out so I would come early if you want full options. The sandwich was the standout for me. The pork was so juicy and succulent and the sauce was spot on. The bread was also the perfect thickness. We split one sandwich between the two of us and it was enough to fill us up along with the pastries.
It was very busy, but two of us were able to get in pretty quickly around 1pm on a Tuesday. The restaurant itself is very comfortable with bar and table seating and a large, delicious looking pastry selection. I had the #24 salad and LOVED it. I would definitely order it again and I rarely order salads. The waitstaff was a little short with us, but honestly, it kept everything moving during such a busy time.
We were walking around old Montreal just past lunch time and our group was getting hungry. We just happened to be a few blocks away from O et G and I had heard great things about the place.It's basically a sandwich, salad, coffee and pastry kind of place. There is a good bit of in and out traffic here, but we were seated immediately by one of the servers. The group ordered the following sandwiches: crab and shrimp, Cajun chicken, Cuban and vegan (with tofu). Every sandwich was better than the next. The crab and shrimp was light and very fresh tasting, while the Cajun was just the right spice with some fresh mango on it, which was a delicious surprise. I am not a big pastry fan, but they were all great (blueberry tart, caramel bar and pecan chocolate cookie) and the expresso was strong. Who could ask for anything more?O et G is a great place to stop whenever walking around in Old Montreal and I will definitely return.
Totally miss going here for long lunches when I had the time to skip out of work. Their sandwiches and soups are amazing. Great atmosphere all around and decent wine selection, too!
Delicious!  Great atmosphere.  Excellent food, cute server.  Famous little spot in Old Montreal :)
Wonderful place to have breakfast. Great atmosphere. I got the egg on your face panini; It had a spicy siracha kick to it which was perfect! The service was on point. Would definitely come here again!
Tried the cuban and the healtny salad both were great. Long line ups but got seated quickly.
I had one of the best Ciabattas I've ever had here. Love the staging as well as their service. Will revisit if I go to Montreal again.
Wowzahhhh. Pastries galore. Gets very crowded on weekends  located in old Montreal. *they do accept credit cardMy highlights:Almond croissant: flaky perfection and everything you look for in an almond croissant. I want more !!!Banana and chocolate brioche: Holy Moly. Chocolate was so rich. It tasted like it was dark chocolate and the gooey'er version of the chocolate you typically find in a chocolate croissant. Highly recommend both of these, you wont regret your trip here!!!
Pretty good! Had to wait in line for 10 minutes. Their paninis are huge, so had to bag up the other half. Nice servers, maybe a bit too crowded. But overall, it was great!
Cuban panini was delicious!  Raspberry lemonade and almond croissant were disappointing...Maison Christian Faure almond croissant is flakier and richer.
Just lovely place that you can feel welcome!!Perfect for vegetarian. Wonderful staff as well as food!!
Excellent spot for lunch. VERY crowded on a summer Saturday, and the staff didn't have the best handle on the commotion. But the sandwiches, coffee, and baked items are awesome. Also dig the interior and decor, very nice design sense. Old Montreal has a serious lack of good coffee stops, which is a shame. The fact this place is an oasis is probably why it's so busy.
Wow, this place was great!I had a breakfast special of a poached egg on a Panini with bacon, herbs, cheese and roasted tomatoes and it was really good - the eggs were perfectly cooked and the bacon added that special richness.  While the breakfast sandwich was very good, the Chocolate Brioche was insanely amazing - rich and buttery brioche bread layered with dark chocolate - it was perfect!  This place is must-visit.
I loved this place, the ambience is super charming! Bread it's amazing delicious, chocolate is not bad. Food have very good taste. Just go there not in holy days because is toooo full and be waiting can be not something to enjoy ;)
Honestly, if my boyfriend brings up this sandwich one.more.time...In fairness, it was THAT good. He had the cuban. I had the poached egg on your face panini. Mine was just the right about of spicy/egg/cheese/bread to immediately cure that slight pounding in my head from the wine the night before. Go. Seriously.
If you're looking for an awesome cafe/ resto place to grab and go in Old Montreal, this Olive & Gourmando is a perfect spot for this. This cozy eatery has amazing baked goods that will leave you smiling :). The only draw back is that it can be pretty crowded especially during the lunch hour.
I enjoyed it. very much. The sandwich was tasty. The staff was friendly. I rather enjoyed it. grilled, fatty sandwiches filled with cheese and pesto and chicken... WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE???
Absolutely great food and service. I got the 'poached egg on your face' panini along with my 2 of my friends and it was one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've ever had. One of my friends also had the homemade ricotta and honey with toast and she said it was some of the best she'd ever had. My only complaint is that they don't sell their amazing green tea in bulk but that only means I will have to stock up next time I'm there (if they decide to sell it). I will definitely be coming back whenever I'm in Montréal again.
Nice place for breakfast/coffee or wine/lunch. Nice options. Good vibe. A tad pricey but normal for that area. I'd go back.Had a vegan sandwich and two glasses of wine yesterday afternoon. Yum. Place was cute, but something was a bit lacking. Not sure what. Feeling, I guess. But that's just me.
The Cubano sandwich is actually life-changing; a bit heavy on the grease, but otherwise spot-on. The daily soups are also worth a try. Get there early or prepare to wait.
Dang Montreal!  Why is your Saturday treating me so rough?  Despite facing a full restaurant in what is the most touristy area in all of Montreal, we wanted to at least give this place a go.  Alas, when we went in to put our name down on the list we were told to go outside.  But, don't you want our name?  No, just go outside.  With 50 people waiting, how the h*ll does that work?  I don't think my face is that memorable and I'm sure you WILL NOT be finding/remembering me out there regardless. Then someone behind the counter yelled right in my ear 'everyone needs to go wait outside now!'  Eh, with sh*tty service before the experience even begins why bother?  Go up to Little Italy or similar ilk to find a) better attitudes b) less crowding c) places that actually welcome your business and d) places that have seating systems that handle heavy wait loads in a timely, efficient and friendly manner.  No opinion on food since we never got any and I, for one, won't be giving them a second chance to find out how it is...
A cozy breakfast cafe, although it is famous for the panini they do not serve it in the morning. It is worth giving a try. The brioche and the egg panini goes very well with the strong aromatic latte.
Such a lovely place! It felt quite SoHo - and in another context I might say that sneeringly. Here, it means the cafe is on a corner in clean, pristine Old Montreal, surrounded by cast-iron-style architecture, open cobblestone alleyways, and horse-drawn carriages passing by the window every minute. (Horses in Manhattan's SoHo would go on a mad killing spree after 5 minutes, but you get the idea)Olive + Gourmando was PACKED for lunch on an early weekday afternoon. It felt a bit touristy but also had its share of locals (e.g. people on laptops).  The location is walking distance from the touristiest (!) part of town, by the Notre Dame Basilica.The ordering process is a little funny. The hostess gives you a blank memo paper with your table #. Go up to the cafe counter or sandwich counter, give them your slip, and place your order. They keep the slip, food is brought to your table, and you can order more at any time by telling them your table #. When you go up to pay, they will already have your complete bill.  The lunch menu is small, with 4 cold/4 hot sandwiches plus soup/salad. There are pegs on the chalkboard to hang signs indicating which are sold out - but they replenish frequently. Our hostess spoke English natively, but the menu is in French. But if you can read English you can easily figure it out (thanks for being 30% French-origin, English Language!)I was so happy to find that not only is this place adorable, the food is da bomb (technical term).  My smoked fish sandwich (a cold option, $10) was packed with shredded smoked trout and slightly sinful with a slab of herbed cream cheese. The centimeter-thick layer of spinach was not overwhelming in the least. The salty trout was balanced out by capers, which I normally dislike but were fabulous here mixed in with sun-dried tomatoes.The Cuban (hot option, $11) was nothing short of amazing - pressed very thin with pancetta instead of ham, and served very hot, with plenty of pickle that imbued just the right tartness to combat all that cheese. Ever had a great Cuban? You won't even know that you WANT MORE delicate pickly tartness til you've had O+G's version.  Mmmmm. Both sandwiches came promptly, which surprised me because the restaurant was so busy. The espresso ($3.25) was fine, nothing spectacular. We also had an apple turnover ($3.75) that was fresh but really not on the adventurous side on either our part or O+G's.  It seems their regular drip coffee is good, since many, many, people came in to order coffee to go.If you're looking for a hectic but lovely luncheon or cafe visit with plenty of Montrealaise flair, try Olive et Gourmando! If you don't care for the hectic part, come well after the lunchtime rush. The food will still be fabulous.
Food isn't bad but it's overrated. Service can be curt at times.It can get crowded quite easily and the parking situation is terrible.
Used to be my favourite breakfast place when I lived nearby. Excellent coffee,patisserie and breakfast offers, but I particularly enjoy this place in winter, it is nice to come in this warm, terrifically smelling cafe on the cold winter morning...  I miss that

Sweet, soft croissants. Some with chocolate, some plain and some with a few surprises on top.Sound:Harmonious conversation. Crunching, slurping, multilingual chatter. The clanking of silverware on plates followed by hushed giggles. Close your eyes and listen to it all.....Come to Montreal, step in olive et gourmando and find out what you love.
Visited Montreal for a long weekend and came back twice because I loved this cafe so much! Their croissants are amazing - tried the plain, chocolate, and also the cheese croissant. My favorite definitely was the cheese croissant. Also had their cappuccino for take away and it was the most perfect start to my day. Came back the a few days later with my girl friends for a quick lunch, and ordered the Tofu Sandwich. My mind was blown. I was already full by half the sandwich, but ate the rest anyway because it was that insanely good. My mind still dreams of this sandwich, and I am scouring all of LA now to find something like that!
Hit the restaurant right before the lunch rush. It was worth the 15 minute wait. The Cuban pannini sandwich was one of the best I've had. The crust was crispy without being too hard. My friend ordered the Mac and Cheese. It came out hot with a nice crust and contained mushrooms and carmelized onions. I definitely would go back
Tried the poached egg in my face panini.  Very good overall and great tasting. The quantity of ingredients was just perfect.  Took is linger to find parking then to devour thus yummy goodness.  Next time I am in the city,  will have to try their pastries
Lovely place for breakfast or lunch. The cafe has a really nice atmosphere and it was definitely a popular lunch place. We had to wait for at least 20 minutes before we were seated. It was worth the wait though! Every dish in the menu is homemade so once they are sold out, they are gone until the next batch is ready. We wanted to try the Viva Las Vegan cold sandwich and the salad of the day, unfortunately both of them were sold out. So we ended up having the Homemade Ricotta "Salty" and #24 salad. And they were both delicious! We also had the banana chocolate brioche which wasn't too bad. This is an awesome place to drop by when you are in the Old Montreal area.
I ate what was possibly the most delicious lunch I've ever had in my adult life. I had Le Gustavo, a beautiful panini-like sandwich of grilled red onions, chicken, gruyere cheese, and mushrooms. It was heavenly. I don't usually rave about sandwiches but this was so good that it really set the bar very high for the rest of my meals during my Montreal trip. There was a line when we arrived but we waited not even 10 minutes. My friend ate Le Cubain and that was just as good. Very cute ambience and cool atmosphere.
Masters of texture and spice, especially along the salty/crunchy/spicy taste nexus.The #5 (chevre) sandwich with grilled onions and homemade ketchup was fabulous and the #6 (pork, asparagus, cheese) was even better, blasts of flavor in every bite.Perpetually crowded so it's easiest to get takeout.Come early because they seem to run out of stuff quickly.
Love their paninis!! Love the decor, sometimes it is too busy, but very good for a light lunch when it is really good weather outside.
Usually a sign for great restaurants is a line outside and this is no different. We had a 25 minute wait for lunch on a Saturday and it was well worth the wait. I had the Mr. Asparagus and it was delicious.
Beautiful brunch spot in old Montreal! During our three-day stay in Montreal, my friend and I came here twice, and we wished we had discovered it sooner!The first time we were there at around 10am, and it was already very crowded. Thankfully the turnover was faster than I expected. My friend and I tried the poached egg panini and the cubain panini, both were hot and crispy on the outside, and rich with melted cheese on the inside, highly recommended!The next day we came back for some baked goods takeaway. The almond croissant was perfect, possibly the best I've ever had, and the chocolate & banana brioche was rich, sweet and delicious.This place is definitely one of the highlights of our Montreal trip. Would definitely come back again!
Excellent!  We had cappuccino,  croissants,  and sweet ricotta.  Delicious!  Be back tomorrow!
Very nice cafe. Was hungry for a dessert and a coffee for pickup.  Everything tasted grate. Only downside is that the place is super busy and loud.
This place rocks. It's a small space and absolutely packed at lunch, so be prepared for a wait. My party of four had to wait about 20 minutes for a table at noon on a Friday. By the time we paid and left though it had calmed down considerably.I really like how they separate the ordering process. You first go to the back to check the menu, see the salads and ask about the day's specials. After you've ordered, you take your seat and servers will bring out your food. Once you're done, they'll ask about coffee and desserts. All in all it's fast, efficient and doesn't force you to decide everything at once.All of the servers are friendly and nice, the hostess especially. It's moderately priced for lunch, around $11 for sandwiches and $3-4 for desserts, but the portions are huge and everything is fresh and delicious.
This place has gotten so much good press it was on the list of must dos for my Montréal vacation. This is a charming, bustling, but small space. Our party of two checked in and were given an estimate of 30 minutes to be seated and within 5, we were led to our counter seats along the long bar which runs in front of the open French windows. I don't usually like counter seating but this let us be in a less busy corner of the restaurant and in a prime spot for people watching. The chocolate brioche was delicious and nicely sized. It was the cold smoked trout panini, though, that was the standout. A white flour grilled bread shaped like a pita but with a moister and more pleasantly rubbery texture was split and stuffed with the trout spread, herbed cream cheese, and a mound of fresh crisp spinach. It was one of those meals that you still think about well after you've eaten it! Highly recommended. Get the window tables!
One place Montreal doesn't generally stack up well to my native New York is gourmet sandwiches. While the French breads make them all pretty enjoyable, when the flashiest topping is ham and cheese you eventually long for a little more excitement. This explains the popularity of Olive Et Gourmando, a small sit-down sandwich shop in Old Montreal which offers interesting sandwich combinations like garlic and yogurt chicken, smoked trout and pancetta, pork and gruyere. The seating is tight and waits can be long but the hipster French cafe vibe, creative sandwiches and local beer and wine selection make them worth putting up with.Recommended: The Gustavo, The Smoked Trout
After a 30 minute wait for a table for two, my sister and I enjoyed a wonderful lunch here. We don't speak French but gathered enough to order the Gustavo and Cajun Chicken paninis. A huge group of about 50 people wearing yoga attire came in for takeout and filled the edges of the store, but our food came out quite quickly. The bread was perfectly toasted, crispy, and delicious. The flavors were perfectly balanced and so tasty. Plus, everyone was incredibly friendly and helpful.FOOD: 5/5ENVIRONMENT: 4/5SERVICE: 5/5VALUE: 4/5OVERALL: 4.5/5
If I could give this place 6 stars I would...unbelieveable ...everything was so fresh, and delicious reasonably priced, the staff was accommodating...we came on a recommendation  and so glad we did.  Fast service, clean, delicious.  If you are debating whether to go...just do it. You will not waste a meal here.
Absolutely loved this spot for brunch! Coming from NYC, I never thought I can love brunch places more than in NYC, but this place did it!Amazing vibe, beautiful crowd, great service, awesome food! And in the prettiest street corner!
I stumbled upon (well more like bixied upon) Olive et Goumando on a sunny Saturday afternoon. Ok, stumbled upon is probably not the right wording either as I was planning on going to O&G but wasn't 100% sure where it was. But my sense of direction is still good as I found it perfectly!Anyways, the place was packed (as usual) and bustling with people.  I had already eaten lunch so just stopped by to try one of their baked goods. Had the almond croissant ($3.75 I believe) and took it to go. Nice and crunchy, sweet but not too sweet - perfect little snack to eat and enjoy while I sat and lounged by the waters in Vieux-Montreal.I have been before and the rest of their food is delicious!
Olive and Gourmando was recommended to me by *many* people before my vacation to Montreal. These people apparently know me well. The decor is right up my alley, a little Anthropologie store, a little cheeky, rustic, and with a hint of luxe. I read the Yelp reviews, so I knew the about the line system and that this place would crazy busy on weekends. We decided to come on a Tuesday to avoid the insanity and we devised a strategy to have breakfast and lunch, with only one trip. It worked perfectly. We were seated within about two minutes of arriving, we did not wait in the check out line to be seated. We each got a latte and a pastry. I had the chocolate brioche and the boyfriend had the banana nut "muffin." It was more like a loaf. The lattes were lovely, great flavor, the right amount of creaminess, but if I could do it again I would get a large, the small was smaller than I expected. The chocolate brioche was divine, though it was a lot of sugar for breakfast. I couldn't stop eating it though. I tried the boyfriend's muffin and it was also great, huge whole walnuts on top to add a nice crunch and nuttiness and the banana flavor was wonderful and it was quite moist. We decided to take sandwiches to go since we were bike sharing to Parc Jean-Drapeau afterwords and had heard such wonderful things about the sandwiches. We asked our server how best to order, since we no longer had a paper with our table number on it. He asked us which ones we wanted and took care of it for us. I got the eggplant and mozzarella one and the boyfriend got the Cuban. They were both delicious, even over an hour later and having been strapped into the front of a Bixi. I will say that mine was great, but his was better. I'm delighted we got to do both the pastries and sandwiches, it was well worth it!
DELICIOUS lunch, snack and coffee spot in the Old Port. Between the four of us, we tried two different paninis, some wine, the raspberry-lime-lemonade (OMG), a latté and an espresso. I skipped lunch and went straight for the almond croissant, and have no regrets. It was served warm and was oh so tender and not too sweet. Everything was top-quality and very tasty. Five stars for the food. Service was fast & friendly too (they now have table service).At 4 p.m. on a Saturday, we had a 20-minute wait so went around the corner to the Phi Centre to check out the art installations. We found the restaurant quite crowded and noisy -- that's what you get at a (deservedly) popular spot, I guess. Prices were normal for the Vieux Port, about $12 for a sandwich and $4-5 for a pastry.Another coup de coeur from the book "Devorer Montréal" by Claire Bouchard & Chantelle Grady.
We went to the Concierge and asked for a recommendation - she was right when she told us to go here even if we had to wait. We also saw it on Yelp.....This is place was buzzing - we put our name on the list and waited 15 minutes. So glad we waited....we shared two dishes, a Cubain pork sandwich and a ricotta 'salty'. Both were 'to die for'....fresh, full of flavour, mouth watering.....and the coffees were the best in our two weeks in Canada. Indeed the coffee's were faultless!This is a restaurant that specialises in quality not quantity...it is a foodie experience and our first experience was so good we went back later for cheese and wine....and this visit was the equal if not better than the first.The atmosphere is alive, energising and warm... the servers are a pleasure to work with.This is true gem of discovery in a sea of mediocrity......a must do.
Although the coffee, sweets and paninis are good, Olive et Gourmando is probably not worth the wait or price.
I was too full to eat a sandwich, which made me quite sad because I had read so many rave reviews about the Poached Egg sandwich and the Cuban. I had to limit myself to the Elixir and an almond croissant. The Elixir was light and refreshing but packed lots of flavor. It's a drink that you sip on, due to the tangy ginger. I've had many bad ginger drinks lately and am relieved that I finally found one that did it justice. The almond croissant wasn't impressive...it probably would have been better if they served it toasted. I've had much better ones in SF. Much, much better. However, I loved the ambiance here and even chatted with a stranger across the table.The only downfall here was that 2 of the staff gave me some attitude for not knowing I had to get a table first before ordering. Some patience and a smile for an out-of-towner would have been nice.
The salads here are really good, and they give you a big portion of delicious, high quality ingredients. Service is fast. You have to order at the counter and then sit down and wait for your food. They were very attentive and kind. My purse fell on the floor and was misplaced at another table, but they found it for me. Lots of well dressed people come here. Tasty pastries, great drink menu! We got each of the croissants - chocolate croissant was very tasty. Also got the salad with a goat cheese dressing - SO yummy but a bit too much dressing.
My friend took me here when I went to visit him this weekend.  It was a bit of a wait but it was so worth it!First, I love love love the atmosphere. Very homey and rustic. Very cute!!! Even though the place was packed, I didn't feel claustrophobic at all.I ordered the raspberry lemonade because I'm a huge fan of lemonade and it was delicious! We started off with the almond croissants that my friend adamantly insisted that we order. I told him that I wasn't a fan of almond croissants and he said to me "it's because you haven't tried the ones from here." And he was right. I have to admit that the almond croissants were the best that I've had so far.We both ordered the Cubain hot panini because who doesn't love paninis? I ordered mine with the southwest tomato soup. Both the panini and the soup were amazing. The panini was divine and the tomato soup was probably one of the best that i have ever tasted! I would definitely go back again!!!
The breakfast panini was awesome! Fruit and yogurt bowl was also good. The chocolate croissant wad a but more like baguette bread than buttery croissant dough. They were packed the whole time we were there and our server forgot to put in our order, so we were there a while. Cute, bustling, and the lunch menu looks worth going back for.
I work at the Old Port so Olive & Gourmando is a great place for lunch. It is normally always busy during lunch time. The Cajun sandwich is excellent along with the chai latte shake (I've only had it in the summer time). A little pricey, but understandably so.
The host at the door was the rudest person I have ever encountered at a restaurant. On noxious, aggressive, impolite. Regardless, we waited patiently for a table of 4, and we were finally seated after 45 minutes of waiting. We ordered our food, and fifteen minutes later, the waitress told us that almost all the food we had ordered was sold out. Being vegetarian, this pretty much left us with no sandwiches to order (what we came for in the first place). So we ended up waiting an hour for nothing to eat. No apology from staff, no compensation, and overall, probably one of the worst experiences I've had in a restaurant.
Such a cosy, beautiful little place to escape the winter chill. I sat on a large wooden bench by the window, surrounded by sweet Christmas decorations as I looked out onto the snowy street. I had a delicious quinoa salad and vegetable soup, finished off with a perfect almond milk latte. While they do serve meat, this place is very vegan friendly.  Love love loved it!
I loved the pouched egg panini but it is a bit salty. I also ordered the yogurt with fruit and it was a good balance.Coffee is amazing !!Waitresses are super friendly and the place has a cozy feeling.
I was in Montreal for a litigation...obviously not good.  But this place was recommended to me for breakfast while I was in town, and it made a miserable trip a little less miserable.It is a very cozy place that makes you feel very comfortable.  The service and the servers were great.  They do not rush you and make you feel very welcome, even though neither my travel companion nor I spoke a lock of French.I was craving a baguette, but when I asked the waitress said they did not make them but recommended their homemade bread with some homemade jam (I think it was peach jam but cannot remember).   It was excellent.My traveling companion had the fresh fruit salad with yogurt and it was a very pretty presentation.  The coffees were excellent.b we also had the chocolate filled croissant which was delicious.Will definitely be back every time.
5 star food with 2 star service - the system for placing/paying for orders makes no sense (you can see other reviews if you don't believe me). I try to avoid it by just getting takeaway, and going to the nearby park if the weather is good.The coffee is actually really good - it's a nice surprise to find deep in the Old Port (a very touristy area).The scrolls they have (raspberry cheesecake, maple and almond, etc) are fantastic, and the croissants they have are good too.Unfortunately, if you eat-in you have to deal with their strange ordering system. After waiting to be seated (which on the weekend is a loooong time - it's a popular place), you get given a piece of paper with your table number. You then need to take this piece of paper to the queue (where all take-out orders are placed too), and give your order. After you've gotten your food, and are ready to pay, you have to get back in the queue (behind all the take-out people) to make your payment. This all means you end up waiting in queue two or three times for the one meal - which just doesn't make sense to me. If I want to pay you, don't make it hard for me!
Love this place and love their sandwiches. But man, it's OVERPOPULATED with tourists. Best time to go is after lunch during the week (that's if your schedule allows it!)
This cozy cafe at the corner of St. Paul and St. Pierre is absolutely wonderful and always pushing great food! The menu is simple, but each item is detailed to perfection, giving your taste buds one hell of a trip. The atmosphere is busy, loud, and fun. The service is attentive and helpful. The presentation of the food, as well as the chef's making the food, is visually appetizing and great. As a corner cafe with tons of windows and a packed interior, Olive et Gourmando makes for great people watching too! My recommendations would be the Cajun Chicken and the Cuban (most popular) sandwiches! They're fantastic. I can't wait to come back and test out more of what they have to offer. Everything looks absolutely delectable. Go, go, go! NOW! Seriously though... go.
Went for lunch on a weekday and of course the place was packed. While there was a daunting line for takeout orders, the service was very fast and efficient and I was out in less than 10 minutes with my order. The cajun chicken sandwich was really tasty - and although it was a bit pricey at ~$12, the portion size was very generous.
AMAZING!!!!!! The food... The location.... Everything is unreal. Although they always change the soup and salad the flavours with never disappoint.  I had the tomato soup and it was so perfect.  Try the Cajun chicken cold sandwich or the grilled cheese hot panini both are amazing
Very quaint Euro cafe in the old city. We had to wait a few minutes for a table on a busy mid-Saturday. We had a table at a bar like area looking out on the very a Euro looking street. People watching at its finest while enjoying awesome espresso drinks, Panzella salad, soup of the day , Cuban sandwich and house lemonade. Service efficient, but certainly not warm and welcoming, but adequate. Food felt very authentic and delicious.
I wish there was a coffee shop like this in every town in every city. This is the model of a perfect cafe: good food, good homemade fresh pastries (almond croissants I LOVE! Cheese ones were also great) and superb coffee. The atmosphere is perfect. Old Montreal in an historic building, the windows, the people, the sounds. It's just so awesome.I went here while on a trip to Montreal to do my final consulate interview for my US immigration. It was awesome because the paperwork came in really quick, and they actually took the time to email me with an update that stuff was approved and being processed. To thank them I sent them a nice message (through the special secure website form - you can't email or call them without giving your case number see and going through all the hoops and such) and I told them to check out this cafe. I'm told the US government will review my helpful tip in 4-6 weeks :P
I will dream about their Cesar salad for a long, long time. It was not a traditional Cesar.  No it was more heavenly.  It had kale and incredible bacon.  Capers and a fantastic dressing.  It was a mountain of deliciousness.  I fear that when in Montreal I will eat this salad three meals a day and miss out on all other culinary experiences.  It had an addictive quality.  I have to think of something else now or the physical cravings will take hold.My husband had a cuban sandwich that was sensational.  Salty goodness.  Great bread.  He also had a fantastic white beer from Italy of all places.  My croissant was not outstanding but good.Our waitress was a gem.  Super friendly.  I am not sure how our lunch turned out to be $50, but it was well worth it.
I came for their so called famous Cuban sandwich. Not really impressed at all. Far from being the best I've had. It was ok. The place itself was cute. Busy, but service was still quick.
Please come to New York!  Love this place - food is fantastic and staff is friendly.  I've been lucky with not ever having a terribly long wait - but I was flexible and sat at the bar if it was busy.  This is the type of place where you can order food that you think you don't like and will love it!  I've yet to have something I didn't like.  Creative menu creations makes choosing what to get a challenge - but always delivers a tasty and healthful lunch.  Yummmmmmmm.  Did i mention that I love this place?!?
Passed by this place twice on our recent trip.Both times, decided to grab a coffee and pastry to-go instead of waiting 30 minutes for a table.Large room with charming decor in Old Montreal.Always packed on the few times we were there.Seems to have a great following, and after taking our first bite the danish, we know know why.Great Americano and Dirty Chai.We tried the Almond Croissant, Chocolate Croissant and Blue Berry Danish.All items ordered were delicious.We will make a bigger effort to eat in for lunch the next time we are in town.
Pastries here are to die for. Don't go on evenings because you'll hit a closed store. If you go on lunch time, be patient: the lineup can be long but it's worth the wait. Sandwiches are pretty good too.
Baaaaad service, they give you attitude!  Sandwiches are just ok.  Granola is delicious though.  I am putting a star because there is no starts option.
This place is out of this world! Perfect for a quick breakfast and lunch and the cafe latte reminded me of Europe!Got to try the cubain and crab roll. The cubain was a more gourmet version than Im used to and the crab roll was light and delicious. The bread is too die for which is why we opted for the chocolate croissant to end our meal with. Would definitely come back!
Excellent salad and sandwiches! Nicely surprised. They were out of our first choices when we went for lunch around 3pm (#24 salad and marinaded tofu sandwich), so we opted for the other vegetarian choices, autumn salad and vegan antipasto sandwich. Delicious! Loved the combination of whipped goat cheese, roasted beets& turnips, and arugula on my autumn salad. Sandwich was also very good. Will definitely come back to try other ones next time I'm in Montreal.
I could tell that this place was extremely popular, as there was a lengthy line waiting outside the restaurant when we arrived, and also when we left (over an hour later). Also, my foodie relatives love this place, so I knew it was going to be good. And it was.We were there for breakfast, so we didn't have their famous sandwiches, but their bakery items were fabulous. Perfect croissants (regular and almond), wonderful (and big!) muffins, fresh scones. The coffees were also excellent. As we left, they were putting out their lunch pastries: unbelievably gorgeous cupcakes and cookies and brownies. All looked amazing. The restaurant interior is really welcoming, with long, warm wooden tables, comfy wooden chairs, wide open big windows (in the summer), chalkboard-covered columns by the entryway with menus and cartoons drawn on it, funky twig decorations hanging over the tables..... The whole place reminded me of some funky, hip hang-outs I used to frequent in my McGill days (in the early '80s). I guess you'd call it a post-hippie kind of vibe. I liked it.What I wasn't so keen on was the whole system of ordering and paying. When the place is crowded (which, I gather, it often is - especially on weekends), it just doesn't make sense to have such a chaotic, inefficient system for diners to order and pay. So many queues, so much waiting, so little room in which to wait. Some older relatives asked me afterwards if they'd like this restaurant and if they should go here, and I had to say no: they'd love the food, but they couldn't handle the process to get their table and order their food and pay. For this reason alone, I think this restaurant is geared more for a younger crowd who can tolerate the wait and chaos.
In the heart of Old Port. This is a gem!! I think this is my favorite place in Montreal, maybe because I loved my sandwich. I had the On Your Face panini sandwich, which was spicy poached egg. SOOO full of flavor. The green tea was also very fresh and tasty, wish they gave it in a bigger glass. Only thing I wasn't a fan of is the set up of the place. Wait in line to get seated, once seated, go wait in line to order, and when you're done eating gotta wait in line to pay. Very inefficient but still loved the food.
3.5*The food is soooooo goood.But the prices are way expensive.Like much more than I think is worth it.  This is why I would not give it a four or five star- I would definitely come here and try most things on the menu once.  I would bring people here from out of town. But I certainly could not justify making this a regular spot with prices like these.
Great ice tea and dirty chai tea!
I LOVE O & G. So much in fact, that I wouldn't mind moving in. Yes, it's THAT good. So first thing's first; do not expect to arrive and saunter in to the table of your choice because that's not going to happen. O & G is packed all the time, and there is almost always a line-up to get in. That said, I usually go for breaky or lunch, so it's possible that late afternoons is quieter but don't count on it. Everything is made fresh, daily, from the salads to the baked goods, to the amazing ginger-lemon iced tea (they really need to offer this in a larger size!). They make a mean latte, and also offer wine (I think it's organic, but I'm not sure). As well, you can buy some of their spicy nuts and jams. The service is OK but not great. It can be very slow and the wait staff don't always think to come and check in once you've been seated so if you're in dire need of coffee, order while you're in line and you can get your fix while waiting for a table. My favorites include:#24 salad - made with raw veggies, roasted peanuts, shallots, tofu, basil, cilantro and mint, served on rice noodles and accompanied by a lovely sweet and sour dressing. Now, the last time I was there I could swear the noodles were buckwheat but I could be making that up in my head.  Anyway, this salad is fresh and incredibly flavourful and leaves your belly feeling just right (read: room for dessert). The Gustavo - holy mother of God, this is good. Garlic grain-fed chicken, grilled onions, balsamic marinated portobello mushrooms, Havarti cheese and maple dijonnaise sauce. Wow. This sandwich can be pretty filling so you may have to take that dessert to go.  Cajun Chicken sandwich - this one is also made with grain-fed chicken and includes guacamole, cajun spices, tomatoes and mango. Equally as delicious as The Gustavo, but packs less of a punch (which is not a bad thing!). I'll eat anything with avocado so this sandwich makes me feel all happy on the inside. Sadly, since i have been tasked with avoiding wheat recently, I opted for the Viva Las Vegan sandwich on my last visit (a great option for all you vegetarians and vegans out there). I loved this one and felt pretty stuffed by the time I was finished. It's got marinated tofu, dill pickles, hummus, caramelized onions, crushed olives, arugula and is served on organic bread. By the way - their breads are like a taste of Heaven, so fluffy and thick. Of course, I ate everything BUT the bread but we don't need to talk about that.If you're a fan of chocolate like me, try their 'Extraordinary Brownie'  or 'The Attack of the Killer Chocolate' cookie (triple chocolate, people!). Both are incredible and will satisfy any chocoholic. Now, GO!
Delicious tea! Delicious coffee! Delicious pastries! Amazing food! This place is fantastic! The inside looks amazing and it's bustling. My favorite aspect of the decor is the tree-like chandelier.  The food and beverages are all high quality. I got my standard earl grey tea and it was served in a chinese tea set! The tea was very floral and sweet, without any sugar being added. We also got the almond croissant, pain au chocolate, and belgian chocolate & pecan cookie.  These were lovely treats, and pretty great quality. I love French croissants and the pastry in the croissants was a little tough and gluten-y. But it was still good.  The cookie was really good too. My colleague had the latte and said it was nice and smooth.Then, my colleague and I shared the Salad #24. I am guessing it's named that because it has 24 ingredients? It was a vegan salad with a lot of amazing ingredients in it like pea shoots, pickled daikon, rainbow carrots, cashews, marinated tofu, basil, mint, sesame..... to name a few. It was so fresh and delicious. We loved it and have resolved to try to reverse engineer this salad back in Vancouver. In short, go here.
Love the lunch here. While it's usually crowded, I've always been able to get a table for 1 right away. Upon my most recent visit I enjoyed the savory ricotta with homemade bread and a delicious broccoli rabe salad with pine nuts, currents, lemon zest and grated parmesan. Additionally, I had a glass of one of the best (microbrew) beers of my life! It was a wonderfully flavorful beer but still on the light side. My server was kind enough to bring out a bottle so I could take a photo. On my way out, I grabbed some baked goods to go. I highly recommend the super- chocolatey cookies, and the sticky buns although I really don't think you can go wrong. This restaurant isn't cheap, but the quality of the food is top notch, and so are the drinks. If you're looking to treat yourself to a nice meal while in the old port, this is the place to go!
If you don't get here during the busy hours, you'll enjoy your experience a lot more. But above all, if you love good food, are looking for somewhere that is a sure thing visiting Montreal, or need an amazing date spot or just want to put something super rich and tasty in your face, go here. There's not a lot of waiting area and waiting in the freezing cold kinda sucks. Also, earlier is better than later as they ran out of their hot sandwiches the day we stopped by.All that said, this place is a gem among gems. The desserts and hot chocolates are made with Valrhona chocolates. The truffle mac and cheese had mushrooms and was the best I'd ever had, and I've had a lot of these! Oddly enough, the addition of actual mushrooms seems to really bridge the rational of putting the truffle flavor in the mac and cheese and isn't so overwhelming. Also, they serve it in an iron skillet, so there's crunchy cheese!The cafe is the perfect level of busy. The tables are really small so sharing is a really good idea. The espressos are perfectly poured. The few pastries they have (okay there's like 20) are phenomenally perfect in their simpleness, like they picked the best things they could make and that's what you get, no complaints there! Get the chocolate brioche if you like dark chocolate.I can't wait to return to Montreal and Olive et Gourmando!
Great atmosphere and friendly service!  The food was wonderful as well.  I had the soup du jour and the Rubenesque sandwich, and my wife the Hot and Cozy Stew... Both excellent.  The pastries here were delicious too!  Would definitely recommend this spot!
O & G never disappoints. My personal faves are the Cuban sandwich and the "24" salad. There are often lines but it is seriously worth the wait.
Every pastry we had was delicious, especially the spicy cornbread pastry and croissant. If I lived in Montreal, would go here again and again to try all their baked goods.
Soooo yummy. Was hanging around old Montreal and came across tons of people lining up in front of this restaurant, went in and ordered some random food for takeout. (So called "random" cuz I can't read French.) After I coming back to hotel and ate them, I was amazed by how good they are - the almond croissant, tartellete, canjun sandwich and homodero sandwich (not sure abt all the spellings) were all beyond my expectation! All 5 stars!
During our four day trip to Montreal we got the chance to visit Olive and Gourmando.  our favorite was the home nade ricotta with honey and orange zest and wow were we blown away by this simple but beautifully presented dish.  overall great experience!  definitely worth your time and money.
Yum! The poached egg paninis and the scones turned this family into a group of glutens eating over paper bags in Notre Dame park. The coffee was nothing to write home about, but it didn't really matter. We have been talking about the paninis for over 2 weeks!
Absolutely charming and delicious, perfect for a morning brunch, nice lunch and even an afternoon wine with a pastry. The crowd is nice yet not uptight and it's also located in the nicest part of the city. Must-do.
Really good panini, but not a lot of choices in the menu. Good place for a quick breakfast
Cutest place we discovered on our last day in Montreal. Brunch line out the door. They also offer pastries to go so got in that line which moved fairly quickly. Chocolate banana brioche bun is all you need to know when going here. Eye opening happiness good. One of the most memorable things I ate on our trip.
BEST. CHOCOLATE. BRIOCHE. EVER!The butter, the rich Valrhona chocolate, the crust. Its all divine and takes me to chocolate heaven.This was booked marked as a must try for our trip to Montreal. I only wish that we could have had a 2nd breakfast here. Very disappointed that it was closed on Sunday. It was super crowded on the Saturday morning we popped in and definitely not suitable for a stroller. I wish we could have eaten in and tried some other things from the food menu but being with a baby means being flexible with our wishes and wants.The coffee was good. I also grabbed a Almond croissant but that was only okay.
I'm giving this place five stars, but I should warn you that even as a tourist, you will be disappointed by how chock full of tourists this place is.The almond croissant was not impressive, but the brioche was, and my husband was immediately obsessed with his cheesy southern biscuit. The coffee was spectacular, and we had a lovely seat by a large open window filled with plants.The ordering process is a bit confusing there, but we didn't have too much of a wait.
OG is the original gangsta when it comes to tasty sandwiches.  I think they own the meat & bread racket in town.  And I'm happy they do.The "panini pomme" that parted my lips began a short-lived love affair with my mouth too torrid to recant in delicious detail on these all-ages pages.  Ham, roasted garlic aioli, walnut butter, smoked Prince Edward Island cheddar finished with mandolin-thin slices of Quebec apples  Suffice to say it was "sex in mouth" as a friend put not-so-delicately.And this was the backup option pointed out to me on the sandwich menu, above left of the deli case at back, after the highly touted cubain was sold out at 4pm the rainy afternoon of my visit.  The shop was quiet; Only two of ten or so tables occupied.  The crew were prepping a quick surprise b-day celebratory break to sing & present a candle-lit cake to a co-worker as I made my way in.  Lighting inside was set on romance level lending appearance of being closed from the outside window.  Staff will seat you if you're staying (and it's so cozy you'll want to), but all sandwiches and viennoiserie (baked pastries) are available for take-away.  Cash, credit ($10 minimum), and debit card ($5 min.) are all accepted.  Sandwiches are between $10-$11, fairly sized and quality-wise unbeatable.There's no doubt I'll be back for another tasty tryst with these sandwich slingers.
This may be the best brunch I have ever had in my life. The poached egg sandwich was excellent - along with the chocolate croissants and butter croissants. I also really enjoyed the hot chocolate drink. It uses real cacao. The staff was very friendly despite the fact that this is probably the most crowded breakfast place in town. I highly recommend this place.
Amazing! Delicious pastries fresh baked. We had the chocolate brioche and almond croissant. Perfect breakfast (or at any time of the day)!
Fantastic food, nice atmosphere. Best Mac and cheese I have ever had. Vegetable soup was also fantastic. Highly recommended.
My first Montreal cafe! It was a cold winter day but excitement definitely aids in ignoring the chill. The weather could explain why I saw few people.   Walking into this place, I discovered this was where everyone was hiding.Packed and bustling is how to describe what I saw. I cannot imagine this place in the summer.My French to say the least is rusty and squeaky would be the best compliment I could hear. I couldn't understand a single word - and I studied it for how long? I swear, even when i heard the basics, I was a bit dumb founded.  Practice, practice, practice.We were seated quickly but I have heard there are long waits. Its a great people watching space if you are waiting. Lots of eye candy. Yummers!So here is why you should go: they serve your coffee with warm, frothy milk. Who does this? Is this a french thing? I love it if it is. The coffee was strong but without any bitterness.  Presentation, atmosphere and speed - this place scores high. If you want something more spacious and quiet, oh, girl, you will have to go elsewhere.As for the French language, they speak English as easily as French - so do not worry!
One word. Actually a few words. The Cuban. That is the only thing I have there and I have been eating there for 7 years.
Delicious! I had the Cuban sandwich. Best ever!!
Cute and cozy. The coffee is delicious here. The pastries are okay, but not outstanding. Definitely come for the coffee though.
Walked over to Olive et Gourmando for breakfast as I had read several Yelp reviews about it.  While I won't agree with it being "the country's greatest" almond croissant... Their croissant was quite tasty and unique from other croissants I've tasted.  Their almond croissant is definitely denser than most. Very buttery and it is a very oblong shape... Almost not resembling the familiar crescent moon shape.  The best way to describe it's distinct taste is that the butter appears to be churned from "raw" cow's milk as there is a sharp dairy taste to it.  But it was a very creamy, almost creme-fraiche-like type of dairy freshness.  It is not a flaky croissant, but rather a buttery type.I also tried the pecan and raisin brioche. It was not teeth-wrenchingly sweet, and had just a tinge of tartness which I would guess comes from a raisin-y syrup or glaze. The brioche was very buttery, flaky on the outer "rings" and dense an buttery in the center.I got a cup of cappuccino to wake me up. The foam was creamy without being too heavy. It wad a great cappuccino!I also thought I should mention their fruit bowl as its not the ol' boring one you'd see in Toronto. Olive et Gourmando's fruit bowl comes with fresh figs, julienned apples, passion fruit, mandarin orange - just to name a few. You get assigned a table. Are given an order form with your table number scribbled down which you bring to the counter, and they will bring you your food after you order. Then at the end you pay at the counter. Only negative is that its cash only.A great place to grab brekkie.  Wish we had more places like this in Toronto!
The Cuban sandwich alone is worth making a detour for this place! The treats are also yummy! It can get busy at lunch time from workers in nearby offices so arrive early (or wait until later in the afternoon!) The staff is friendly mostly.
We've only been here once but I still daydream about the sweet ricotta and egg panini which were absolutely amazing! However, I did feel that the pastries were nothing special. My husband and I had a chocolate croissant and banana brioche and felt they are nowhere near as good as other bakeries. But given that the breakfast specials were so good, perhaps we need to try the pastries a second time in case we just got a bad batch? :)
Very cozzy atmosphere. Probably the best place to eat panini in town. Great and friendly service. The place is very small though, you are kind of feel squeezed.
Delicious treats in a cool atmosphere in an even cooler part of town!
First time visiting Montreal and heard lots of good things about the paninis here. Got there around 10:15am and it was pretty busy. Was just the two of us so there was no wait. Service was attentive and courteous. We were there before the lunch menu was out so we settled for the "Poached egg on your face" panini. Spicy poached eggs with herbs and mayo, Comte cheese, speck and slow roasted tomatoes. It was probably the best panini I've ever had. Super crispy crust, gooey cheese and all the flavours went very well together. Definitely a must-visit!
This tiny place is ALWAYS full, which  isn't a surprise : they make awesome sandwiches. They also make daily salads and soups which are aways yummy. If you deserve a treat, go for their somptuous brownie! Olive & Gourmando definitely isn't too good if you're on a diet, but still, it's always a good treat.
Found this place based on fellow yelpers - was not disappointed.  Got seated without too much of a wait at the communal table (I was by myself).  Wait staff was running around but still came to take my order very quickly.  I ordered the soup of the day (Celeriac cream with almond brussels spout garnish) and a Cuban panini sandwich.  Soup was just delicious (my waitress told me their soup is always good).  Picked up an almond croissant on my way out to pay (how can I not).  Planning to go back again to try the Brioche and coffee that everyone is raving above (and really mainly to get my soup fix).
With so much pastry, fine dining, and Canadian comfort food to be sampled on our brief visit to Montreal 'breakfasts' as a proper sit-down entity were still not to be overlooked (much to my family's dismay and with a schedule heavy on museums, churches, and hockey along with the food mornings would be early - and thankfully so would be the opening times of each of the three breakfast spots we decided to try.Beginning first with perhaps the most oft raved breakfast in the city we almost ended up taking a pass on Olive + Gourmando because the traffic and parking on the tight streets of the busy business district is nothing short of a nightmare during the morning rush - but thankfully, as fate would have it a spot opened up on our third trip around the block and with streets uneven and crowd bustling we made our way into the small store and restaurant only a few minutes later than anticipated.Owned and operated by Dyan Solomon and Eric Girard Olive + Gourmando reminds one much of Panera as you walk in - a few dry goods and baked items up front along with the local paper plus a busy kitchen in back, but with communal tables consistently packed as people vie for space and the air rife with notes of coffee, butter, and vanilla there is clearly more than "quick casual" at play - specifically the use of all natural, organic, and high quality local ingredients in each of the restaurant's creations; items I was left to select for the group as my mother and aunt attempted (successfully) to procure seating.Utilizing both the pastry counter, kitchen, and servers to facilitate service the modus operandi at O+G is to order at the pastry counter, find a seat, and wait for the items to arrive - a successful approach even despite my over-ordering that led to an impressive pile of food arriving perhaps 10 minutes later - each item warmed or hot and from the coffee to the sandwich to each of our four baked goods everything looked fantastic despite the simple style of preparation on brown paper in wooden baskets.Beginning first with the coffee - mostly espresso but also offering an Americano I eschewed my traditional ordering and went with a double based on the recommendation of the barista that the beans taste best without the added water and with the roast very low in acidity I had to agree, particularly given the smoky top notes and mellow caramel tones underneath - no sugar was added and none was needed.Moving next to the pastries, a quartet was selected and attempting to make selections that would appease all I ran the gamut of flavors from fruit to chocolate and light to heavy beginning first with two spirals of brioche; one Raspberry Cheesecake, the other Valrhona Chocolate, and both exemplary.  Beginning first with the eggy bread - crisp on the shell with a wispy and rich pull-apart within and lightly kissed with an egg wash before its trip to the oven both curls were rife with their respective ingredients and as much as I love Valrhona dark it was the cheesecake that impressed most - a rich balance of the cream cheese's smoothness with sweet pureed raspberries complete with seeds.Moving on to the measuring stick, an oblong almond croissant, I found myself somewhat less impressed than I had expected largely due to the texture produced by such a tightly wound crumb.  Certainly tinged with almond and packed with butter this simply was not the texture I would expect for a croissant - more like a breadstick in its lack of an air-pocketed leavened crumb.  Good, but not on par with the rest of the choices, including the Chausson Aux Pommes sharing its basket.  Translated literally as 'slipper of apples' it would be hard for me to find something more comforting than this hand-pie and no matter what language the crispy golden shell and dense core of pan cooked cinnamon apples was lovely - the only thing that would have made it better was ice, or perhaps whipped, cream.For our final choice, the only kitchen item that screamed 'must order' we received the "Poached Egg on Your Face Sandwich" - a pressed panini made with house ciabatta filled with sauteed onions, a thick curl of aged Comte, confit tomatoes, griddled speck, and 'cooked egg salad.'  Hitting on pretty much all of the savory notes with the caramelized onions and bright tomatoes acting to cut the fat just a bit the most intriguing aspect of this dish to me was the 'salad' - a texture somewhere between rough chopped hardboiled eggs and a lightly poached egg but very interesting on the tongue.  A great meal from first sip to last bite with only a slightly disappointing almond croissant to mar the experience I definitely understand the hype around Olive + Gourmando and compared to our other Montreal Breakfasts it is the only one to which I'd return.
This place was absolutely packed on Saturday afternoon. My traveling companion and I had somewhere to be within an hour so we decided to get something from the to go counter at Olive et Gourmando. After spending 10 minutes trying to translate the menu we discovered that the woman behind the counter spoke very good English. Once translated everything sounded delicious, but I settled on the ricotta and bread, especially after hearing that their bread was baked in house.  We took our food back to Le Petite Hotel*  and I savored every last bite of this ricotta goodness. Soooo delicious! My traveling companion seemed just as happy with her salad.Unfortunately, my stay in Montreal was pretty short or I would have tried to squeeze in one more meal at Olive et Gourmando.yelp.com/biz/le-petit-ho…
Had Cuban sandwich and butternut squash soup, both packed with great flavour. I will definitely come back to try more
Love their cuban pannini!
I think I died and went to cafe heaven!This place is marvelous! It has sass, charm, culinary aptitude, & most of all the best carbs in baked form one can find!Came during 3 separate occasions, bumped into Kristin Chenoweth & Kathy Griffin, gorged myself silly, and just sat in utter content at what a charming place this establishment was!Had the following: egg in your face panini, peach shortcake, chocolate banana brioche, cheese croissant, almond croissant, pecan chocolate cookie, & zucchini cupcake.  I want more...
I don't even have the words for this place. All I have are gurgling happy tummy noises and salivating. Perfect fall-almost-winter meal: Squash soup (with pumpkin seeds, tomatoes, pesto, chickpeas and about a million other fun "You can put that in soup?"-ingredients). Heavenly. A little kick to it. Hearty and warm, but not enough for a meal. You must get a sandwich. I got the Cuban. Gruyere on a Cuban? Yes please. Pulled pork, pancetta, and loads of melty, melty gruyere. You will scoff at anyone who ever tries to serve you Swiss cheese on a Cuban ever again. My wifey had a salad. Borrrrrrrring. You must get a sandwich.Friendly service, cute vibe, hipster iced teas, 80s pop. Total win.
We arrived during lunch and of course there was a wait so we decided to take it to go and just eat outdoor since it was such a nice day out. Cute and charming place. The Cuban panini was soooo good. I love a good panini but this was probably best I've had.  The bread crust was perfectly crispy without being too hard but once you chew into it...it was soft and melts in your mouth. The filling with pork and panceta was yummy with their blend of mayo. We also got the almond croissant which was also so yummy...it was flaky,  buttery, and soft...not too sweet. Definitely a highlight of my food adventure in Montreal.
Chocolate banana brioche bun!!!! This is their number one pastry! I was lucky there were some left. This is a cute cafe with outlets, food, baked goods and drinks. I paired a short espresso with my pastry and it was amazing! I could only eat half of the bun so definitely a pastry to share. Its dense, sweet and soft. Great place to check out and people watch!
Used to be much better a few years ago. Too pathetic and overpriced for this quality.
gotta say it: it's super cute in here. super busy, but turnover is pretty quick. breakfast was super good. we got the "poached egg in your face" panini, a plain croissant, and toast with jam and butter. the toast was toast, but the raspberry jam was yum. i really liked my croissant - it wasnt crazy buttery, the inside was soft and chewy and the outside was nice and crispy. the panini was great, especially for someone who likes savory breakfast - salty but not toooo salty with the speck, the sriracha adds a good dab of heat, and the tomatoes round it out. nom.
Yummy - albeit a little overpriced and most of the options run out so make sure you go early.
We loved this place. Excellent food, great coffee, and their Earl Gray tea was very aromatic (by Camilla Senesis). We had breakfast and lunch. They make it, people eat and then it's gone - so if you want to try down thing - be there early or it may be gone by the time you decide to roll in. Mt wife and I would certainly come and eat there again when we are back in Montreal and we will for sure be back.
A bit of a line up but definitely worth it.  A pretty good vegetarian selection.  Food is very rich though--so make sure your eyes are not bigger than your stomach.
My wife and I have been here 3 or 4 times and have loved it each time.  My first impressions were that the food is overpriced, the wait is too long, and the place is too crowded.  That however was before I tasted the food.  In short, this place delivers every time.  Our last visit (Labor Day weekend 2013) was delightful as always.  In addition to the standards of the terrific sandwiches and salads, they had a cold cucumber and dill soup that was outstanding and epitomized the restaurant's commitment to flavor and freshness.  Also, the pastries are of course top notch and the staff members are very pleasant.  The only critique I have is for the coffee.  The long espressos I have ordered were a little sour and underwhelming.I am pretty sure this place is in all the American guidebooks b/c my friends who have visited Montreal have all gone here as well (independent of a recommendation from me) and most everyone we observe on the weekends appear to be tourists.  Nonetheless, my wife and I typically make OG the very first place we visit when we arrive in Montreal.As others have mentioned, not open on Sunday and Monday.
So yummy! The BREAD...got a plane to catch and making this a priority destination stop for munchies later. The wait is super long but worth it. Good things come with patience.
Such great food and it's all made in house! It's busy for good reason :) the almond croissants especially, are to die for.
Great food!!!! And excellent atmosphere. Everything is made In house - the pistachio muffin is to die for.The only drawback is that they will not do any substitutions - even for kids
This gem was a block from where I was staying. After passing it the first few days, I decided to stop in and was blown away by my latte and ricotta cheese/honey/orange rind with toast breakfast I had. I'll be back before I leave!
I give it a breakfast 5 stars, but . . . it is not for anyone looking for a typical breakfast. No omelets and waffles here. We loved our fresh yogurt, fruit and granola; the pastries are amazing; great coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice. They did have a breakfast panini that included egg that looked really good. It's a fun place with a quick turn-around in Old Montreal.
A fun, quirky spot in the old town.  A delicious sandwich menu, but my favorite is the  baked truffle mac and cheese.A fun spot to grab a coffee and a bite while sight-seeing.
The best sandwiches, salads, and baked goods in Old Montreal.  It's on a busy street full of office workers and tourist, but it's certainly worth the wait.  I also like going there in the morning before it gets very packed.  I here in the summer they have a rooftop garden where they grow the vegetables.  Can't wait to try them.  It's on a pricier side for sandwiches and salads, but you will definitely not be disappointed.
great stuff! the almond croissant was delish and the coffee really good. make sure to try the scones. It a busy place but worth it!
Wow the almond croissant!!!Cane back on Sunday to get some to go and they were closed.  Next time I will not be that eager and I will Yelp the closing times!!!
This place has a bit of a reputation. There was a long line to get a table -- we waited about 40 minutes, then another line to order, and another line to pay our bill, heck even a line to go to the bathroom... and yes, after all that I can still say it was worth it. The food, especially the sandwiches are out of this world, with special kudos to The Cuban. The breads, excellent, the pastries, not so much.They also serve a rose from Corsica that was amazing. The staff were exceptional considering the difficult crazy busy & crowed conditions when we were there, with special props to the girl who manages the waiting list.I'd try and go at off hours on an off day, but I definitely would go!
Graciously made room for our party of 6 with very little fuss. Only complaint is that they were out of about half of the sandwiches on the menu and did not tell us until we were about to order. I had the cesar salad with the yogurt chicken which had a great balance of bacon, cheese, lettuce, kale, capers and croutons. The place itself was so cozy on the inside. The decor was fabulous and everything tasted very fresh. Great find and would love to go back!
Best sandwich ever! I have only been there for lunch, and even though the place is always packed, they will find a table for you within a few minutes! Overall a very good service.The food is just incredible! It's a mix between a sandwich place and a salad bar, with the menu written in chalk on the walls. I highly recommend the cuban sandwich, but get there early because they do run out!I have never tried the coffee shop and pastries part of the café, but it looks incredible!Because of its location and the quality of their food the prices are on the high part of the scale for a sandwich ($9), and it's widely worth it!!!Watch out for opening hours they are closed on Sunday and Monday (which is very rare in Montréal)I just wished they had other locations around the city!
Easily the best place in the Old Port to get a fantastic lunch. Their only downfall is they sometimes get ingredient happy and add one too many ideas into their soups, but the food is always interesting. Their Cubano sandwich is excellent! And all their baked treats and goodies are completely yummy.
This is a great place for lunch. I love the salads and sandwiches. I had the Cajun Chicken Sandwich, roasted grain-fed chicken breast rubbed with cajun spices, guacamole, fresh tomatoes, and mangoes. It was delicious. I also had their salad of the day, which was equally delicious. I wish I was in town longer because I heard the breakfast and pastries are great too. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience here.  The food is fresh and creative. The decor is adorable. It's so warm and welcoming.  Add this place to your list.
This place is great.  Food is soooo tasty.  It is very crowded though and they run out of their tasty food.  Which speaks more to the quality of the food.  Staff are friendly but expect lineups to get in, and to pay.  And you might not get the menu item you want if they run out but everything else is great on the menu anyways.  We ate pastries, scobe, croissant, goat cheese sandwich, green salad and latte.  All great. Also god location close to all the art galleries in old Montreal.
This cafe is such a little gem in an otherwise tourist-laden area of the city. The sandwiches are delicious and they offer many house made drink specials like fresh limeade or lemonade and they have plenty of options for vegetarians as well.Be sure to get a baked good treat for the walk home!
Having heard about this place from several different sources it was a must on the list for our recent Montreal visit.  Unfortunately, we were only in the fine city for 3 full days and I had a long list of musts.  I was familiar with the general location of the restaurant but hadn't pinpointed the exact location when we came upon it by chance while wandering around the neighborhood.We already had lunch plans for the day but because my feet and my nose wouldn't let me walk past without going in, we decided to get some pastries for later.  One step inside and I knew that no matter how packed our culinary itinerary was - we would be back!The first visit we took away a chocolate croissant and perhaps one of the best bites from our entire trip - a turtle bar.  The shortbread was amazing and it was topped with a very rich chocolate ganache.  It really was once of the best sweet bites in a trip filled with so many!I managed to talk my husband into coming back for breakfast the morning we left Montreal for home...quite the feat since he had one thing on his mind: the 9 hour drive.  To which I said that meant we needed a very special breakfast to fuel the ride home.  In the end, I won out but just barely, especially when a parking snafu would have no doubt resulted in a  ticket (parking signs in French  - gotta love them).  The place is so popular that there wasn't a (legal) place to park within 2 blocks.  The weekend morning was a busy mess.  A hostess kindly explained the procedure while hubby dashed out to move the car.  I was assigned a table, given a card that I should take to the pastry counter to order, and found myself in the midst of a loud group of tourists, regulars, and one very unhappy little girl who protested quite loudly that she wanted out of the clutches of her daddy's arms.  Wondering if I had made a mistake by dragging hubby here rather than grabbing a bite to eat at many of the places closer to our hotel I ordered a juice, coffee, almond croissant and the deliciously sounding 'egg on your face' panini.  I returned to my assigned table, was given a bottle of water and then shortly our coffee and juice arrived.  I began to settle down a bit as I surveyed the yummy looking food being enjoyed at the tables around me and knew that what was to follow would be worth the headache of parking and slight delay in getting on the road.  I loved the drawings on the chalkboard and found it curious to read that one Saturday in June  of 1998 only 3 customers were served all day long.  What a stark contrast that was to the bustle of this Saturday morning where there was a constant line out the door!    While I was happy for their success, I secretly thought to myself that perhaps a happy medium between 3 customers and the hundreds (literally) that would overrun the peaceful dining area would be nice.    I was pleased when the panini and croissant arrived.  We shared both and had a happy little breakfast.  The panini was a good size and the bread was toasted perfectly.  The prosciutto was of good quality and paired well with the poached egg salad.  Not a fan of runny egg yolk, I'm happy to report that the eggs were soft but not runny.  It was a very delicious sandwich.The set-up was odd to me in that we had to pay at the end of the meal by getting in the long line again, giving the cashier our table number and then being cashed out.  Perhaps it was a system that worked better when not so crowded.  Or, as my husband stated, perhaps it was to tempt you one last time with the delicious pastries while waiting in line.  If it was the ladder, it certainly did its trick with me as I couldn't help but order a chocolate croissant for the road (sadly, none of the cookies or that amazing turtle bar were available at the time).If you are in Montreal, you must stop, even if only for a sweet bite to eat.  Oh, and if you can possibly walk over, I'd strongly suggest that as well!!  Happy noshing.
The Skinny: really great pastries including the almond croissants and the chocolate brioches (4) The service, if dining in, can be confusing because you have to order everything at the back counter.  Unfortunately, the restaurant is claustrophobic, and noisy. They also don't take credit cards unless you have over a $10 purchase (3) Overall, this is a great little breakfast/brunch/lunch spot. If you can't take the crowd, get your stuff to go (4).After discovering this place on Yelp, I ventured to this cafe at least 3 times during my short stay. I ate in once but after experiencing the crowd decided to do take-out afterwards.This place is definitely hopping. Primarily a breakfast/lunch place, every time I went here, it was literally brimming with people. At 2:30 pm, you had to wait 10-15 minutes to get a table for three. Service is confusing so I'll give you the low-down. If you decide to eat in, your waitress will hand you a meal ticket which you are supposed to bring to the back sandwich counter. Order all your drinks, pastries and sandwiches there and they will bring out your order to you afterwards. If you want to add anything to your meal, you just go to the back counter and let the server know what you want and they will add it to your tab. When you are done, you line up at the pastry/to-go line and pay there.All I can say is pastries are king here. I had three different types of brioche and almond croissant here. Everything was pretty good here. Personally I think the best of the bunch was the chocolate brioche. The lovely pastry was brimming with Valharona chocolate encased with a flaky, buttery bread. Chocoholic porn. 'Nuff said.Almond croissants were also delicious however were a little on the thinner side. The maple/nut and banana/chocolate brioches was a little too moist for my taste which was detrimental to the pastry itself. The flavours however were very good despite this which was why this place gets a 4 for food.On the down side, this place is very crazy. Literally, there is no space in this cafe. So don't expect to have a quiet little snack around here. Noise is at a premium while you'll probably be able to overhear your neighbours conversations. Another con is the credit card policy (no credit card over $10). I also wished they made chai lattes too.Overall, a great little breakfast/lunch spot in downtown Montreal (4).
Came here to sit down and get lunch but ended up just ordering and eating at a local park with the ladyAtmosphere:- Bustling sandwich place that is very popular- You can sit down (35min wait at 1:15 on a Tuesday) or go to the back and order a sandwichService: - No complaintsFood:- Lady got the L'Antipasto which was amazing.  Eggplant on there with the moz cheese and basil really made for a creative and interesting sandwich.  I was having a bit of sandwich envy on this one.- I got the Cuban which was a little heavy but very tasty (heavy on the mayo).  Her sandwich definitely takes the price for creative and delicious- Salads looked very tasty and creativeOther:- Prices are a little high, but this is the old port - Not open on Sundays or Mondays- Want to go back to try some of the other sandwiches- They do not sell brand name drinks (coke, etc)
Came back last week and my old review still stands. Expensive for what you're getting, but the pressed sandwiches are delicious! The baked goods were a bit dry and not really worth getting except for the chocolate croissant.
always always love this place... their salads and sandwiches are tdf! Its a little pricey but worth every penny. You can tell that the best ingredients go into the food here, you taste it! Yum...my favorite lunch place in Old Montreal
Loved this place. Every time we tried to grab breakfast or lunch here, there was a line out the door. So, in the midst of a drenching downpour, we ran to O&G for an early dinner at 5:15 pm. When we arrived, we were shown a table for our large party of six. We were also told that the cafe closes at 6 and they were out of all cold sandwiches. Soaked and ravenous, we ordered teas, coffees, hot paninis and a fabulous ricotta, corn and tomato salad. The food was delicious--made with interesting combinations of real, fresh ingredients. Just what we needed warm up and fill up. Almond croissant was divine, as well.
Stopped by this little gem this past weekend.  Got a poached egg sandwich with all kinds of goodies -- chives, cheese, ham, sundried tomatoes and sriracha sauce.  This was an amazing sandwich.  It had a great blend of flavor, spice and gooeiness and surprisingly not as messy as you'd think.  Also went 'fat boy' and got an almond croissant.  Very flakey and not overly sweet which was great for me.There were two disappoints.  The place was very busy which I expected on a Saturday morning but they managed the traffic poorly.  It took us a while to figure out where the line for carry out orders started/ended and there were a lot of people there for dine in service that seemed to have a similar problem.  Overall though, the wait was quicker than I would have expected despite the initial confusion.  The other disappointment was the iced coffee...it was basically espresso over ice...had only one size which was a small and it didn't taste very good as it a was bitter.  I'm sure the hot coffee would is fine though as the coffee did smell amazing.But really, the food is worth it and it still gets a 5 stars from me.
Neat little shop in the old port. Their food is very good and of high quality. However, there is usually a long line to get in and it takes a while to order from the two different counters. The food is great though.
At the risk of posting yet another redundant review, this place is great. Tasty sandwiches, pastries, wine, beer and coffee.  Great atmosphere and a cool (albeit touristy) location near the old port.The best compliment I could say give this place, beyond great food and drink, is that the pacing was perfect.  Although there was a long wait to get in on the rainy day, they never rushed us, and we felt very comfortable lounging for an extended late lunch.   As an American, it had a very "euro" feel, in a good way.  If I ever make it back to Montreal, i'll definitely head back here.
(*4.5) They are packed in the brunch hours. A standard 20 min wait to be expected. As a result, the service is rushed with the get in and get out mentality. Sandwiches & panini are delicious. The Cajun Chicken sandwich was sweet and savoury with the guacamole, fresh tomatoes, and mangoes providing a real fresh taste. We didn't order any but their salads looked extraordinary. Their prices are actually quite competitive considering they are in a posh area of town. They also have a great selection of baked goods. Overall, the quality and care put into the food does not go unnoticed, I just wouldn't rate it 5/5.
VIBE O+G hits all of the marks - great local Montreal vibe with both English and French Montreal chowing down. Go to your table, then go to the counter, get what they have (they don't really make substitutions either) et voila! It is very busy here. PS they have a lovely chandelier in the middle. I ATEI had the truffled mac and cheese with mushrooms and a hardened crust on top. Bestill my heart. They evened out the fattiness of that dish with a side salad. Wish I could have gotten a soup. Dining partners had soups and sandwiches and vegetarian chili. Croissants transport you back to France. The desserts? Like their chocolate tart with a crispy, crunch bottom? Oh mon dieu! OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK Definitely one of those lunch/brunch places you travel to and return to again and again. Le sigh. Pricey but worth it.
Olive & Gourmando was a must-stop on my Montreal itinerary. They are closed Sundays & Mondays, so I forced my group to stop by for a quick bite. Everyone was grumpy from walking around all day.The pastries looked amazing - all glazed and sugared up! We didn't eat any real food, but I saw some sandwiches/soups that nearby tables got and they looked very healthy and hearty! For the 4 of us, I chose a blueberry pastry and the famed almond croissant. Unfortunately, they ran out of the chocolate brioche :( Both pastries were unbelievably buttery, flaky, and delicious! We ordered an extra almond croissant for the road.  Nobody was grumpy anymore!O&G's decor was homey and cozy - would love a place like this back in the city!
I love this place! The food is amazing and the service was wonderful! We ordered breakfast poach egg panini, cheese croissant and a butter croissant! All really delicious!We will revisit again when we are in Montreal!
Was here last spring.  Will be back to Montreal, because of this place!  Went here twice, for the short four-day stay at Montreal. Would like to try all the sandwiches, soups and hot beverages.  You will like the mocha! Very friendly staff too!
didnt know this place can be sooooo crowded! well it was late morning brunch time so...i really like the decor and the food presentations/ platings.the pastries looks & smells really good. i had a Cuban sandwich which was perfect for that rainy morning! lots of cheese nom nom nom.. the panini was grilled to perfect, crunchy on the outside and hot n soft on the inside. my friend had a crab salad sandwich which looks refreshing & good tasting as well ;)staff were helpful and service were fairly fast even when this place was packed with ppl.highly recommended!
Food was great, had the Cuban sandwich. Service was friendly. Cashing out is awkward.
My wife and I were here in late August and ate here twice while we were in Montreal. The food is delicious as is the coffee and tea. Expect a wait and tight seating quarters but fantastic atmosphere. My favorite waiter sang chaud laaaaa! Every time he went to the kitchen. We will definitely return when we are back in Montreal.
YUM I really liked this place, I had a plate that had some veggie quinoa combo that was like a party in my mouth. I dont remember what my boyfriend had cuz to be honest, I was busy...but I remember he liked it too! I deducted one star for the baked good because although the flavors were nice we had like a ginger cherry scone and something else, they were crumbling like crazy and to be honest Ive had better. But the decor and the place is sooo cozy you just want to curl up in there and pet a cat. Dont ask me why, thats just how I feel.
Great sandwiches especially the Cubain. The espresso brownies are also excellent. Worth the wait, but better if you get there before or after the lunch rush.
Just so happened to stumble into this place because it started to rain.  I'm enamoured with this place.  Cute, welcoming, unique decor that has a homey feel to it.  We were first seated, then advised that all the coffee/baked goods were to be ordered in the front while the back counter had all the lunch items.  We placed our order and then waited for server to bring it over to us. I got a cafe latte, my fiance ordered bancha green and shared a raison scone.  Their small latte is about 8 ounces which is smaller than most places so it was stronger than I was expecting it to be but still enjoyed it.  The bancha tea was served in a teapot with a cup both served on a wooden platter - cute.  It was paired perfectly with the raison scone which was sweet and had a light lemon flavour to it.  I'm usually not a fan of raisons but this was good. From the brief look at the lunch items (mostly sandwiches), they were all just under $10. I wish I had a bigger stomach. Note: ALL the baked goods are made in house - yummeh!
What a fabulous little cafe! I only tried breakfast here, but it was so good I came back again the next morning. The coffee was perfect and the pastry was equally delicious. Pass on the chain coffee shops and head straight to this little place. Worth it, even if you have to wait.
Don't miss this spot!Went here for lunch while visiting Montreal after reading the Yelp reviews.  It was so amazing that we went back for breakfast!  Absolutely delicious lattes and coffees, scrumptious pastries (I loved the almond croissant; the valrhona choc brioche was also amazing, tho extremely chocolatey), and delicious sandwiches and salads.  My cousins, who are from Montreal, almost died when we told them we found this place -- it is one of their faves.Don't give up on the long wait -- it moves more quickly than you expect and it's well worth it.  Special shout out to the lovely hostess (didn't catch her name) who was warm and friendly and remembered us when we returned the next day.We will most certainly return when we go back to Montreal.
my pain au chocolate was very tasty and the coffee too. a bit expensive, but we are in vieux montréaò
The chocolate croissants melt in your mouth and your coffee. Excellent decor. Great staff. Welcoming atmosphere. If your in the old city it's the best way to start your day or to spend a leisurely brunch.
Simply amazing!  The wonderful vegan selection was delectable. The service and atmosphere were charming.
It was our favorite place for lunch, and breakfast during our stay in Montreal. I recommend getting the food to go, and going to old port to eat. The place gets pretty crowded, and wait is a bit long to sit inside. Everything here is great, but I highly recommend poached egg sandwich, chocolate brioche, cubain, smoked trout, and cajun chicken.
This review is long overdue. Came here on the last day of my conference to grab lunch and found an incredibly long line with tons of people inside the little space. But I had time on my hands, so I went to the back of the line and waited for my turn. Lots of delicious looking treats on display. I got some sort of a chicken sandwich and a brioche. The sandwich was flavorful but rather greasy and a bit messy to eat. The brioche unfortunately I wasn't able to get to until the next day and got a bit dry, but overall good flavors.
An adorable place in Old Montreal get a great breakfast/brunch!The space is quaint, cozy, and FULL of people. Don't let that deter you, the food is worth the wait. The poached egg sandwich was completely delicious - perfectly cooked egg, a roasted tomato that was the star of the sandwich, and some smoky prosciutto that added another great layer of  flavor.Service is great considering how busy they are. The folks that work there are friendly and very helpful.Don't leave without a sweet treat for the road. The salted caramel turtle bar was seriously the yummiest thing I ate in all of Montreal.
Olive et Gourmando is just oh-so-quaint and charming that it's hard not to fall in instant crush with it... or at least for me.  I came here on my last morning in Montreal during labor day weekend.  I absolutely adore the small decorative details and the cozy atmosphere which was perfect for enjoying a scrumptious breakfast and some hot chocolate before my flight home. Service was helpful and pleasant. Since we had arrived too early for lunch, we were limited to their breakfast menu and opted for the following:Poached egg on your face paniniA delicious panini filled with poached egg salad, comte cheese, prosciutto, and roasted tomatoes.  The egg salad was light and fluffy and perfectly complemented by the sweet and saltyness of the prosciutto and roasted tomatoes. My favorite breakfast panini by far.Almond CroissantMy fellow yelpers don't lie. This is a must have at O+G.  I particularly liked that this pastry was fluffy throughout even though it appears that it wouldn't be upon first glance. Olive et Gourmando makes me sigh with a smile.  It will definitely remain on my bookmarked lists of eateries to visit again the next time I'm in Montreal.
Great lunch spot in old Montreal.  The radishes on my salad were picked from their garden out back, which I thought was pretty impressive.  My friends sandwich was OK, not great, but it was kind of their specialty item.  The Cuban I believe it was. The spicy chipotle type sauce kind of over drenched the sandwich in my opinion, which I hate.  My meal was good plus the overall atmosphere and decor of the place sway me into giving a 4.  That said, I used yelp to find the place so nothing new to report I guess.
One of the best Cuban sandwiches I have had....and I have had them in a lot of countries....   Long wait but it was worth it.  Very reasonably priced as well.
I got an Everything Cookie and an almond croissant - the baked goods were certainly good, but I'm not sure I would brave the line and crowds to eat in. I got my food to go - which, coincidentally, was a little expensive relative to the rest of Montreal. The Everything Cookie contained walnuts, oats, chocolate and candied ginger. The almond croissant was more chewy and moist than flaky, but still very good.
Ooo la la!  Cet endroit est incroyable!  Okay, so I used Google Translator for that French.  Not sure if it appropriately translated, so this is what I wrote..."Ooo la la!  This place is incredible!"We had heard about it from folks we met in Toronto.  When we were walking around Old Town in Montreal, we weren't looking for it...but we stumbled onto it.  Glad we did!  The line was very long, so we decided to come back mid-afternoon.  Good choice, even though there was still a line...it was much shorter.  The wait was worth every minute!We had delicious sandwich and one of the best salads (unusual combo) ever.  Of course, on the way out the door we bought a few baked goodies.This place was one of the top 3 places we ate at during our two week trip.  Great food and fun, energetic atmosphere!Enjoy!
This small cafe has the best sandwiches and cookies in town! All the waiters are very helpful and friendly and the atmosphere is cheerful.
This place is amazing.  It has one of the absolute best breakfast sandwiches ever - crispy bread with a zesty spread, prosciutto, melted cheese, eggs, etc.  Amazing I tell you.  I highly recommend the homemade ricotta with toast.  And the baked goods - oh my, they are superb.  The scone is fruity, perfectly crumbly, stellar.  The apple turnover is a solid choice.  The chocolate croissant is delicious (maybe not as perfectly flaky as can be - but the creamy chocolate interior is outstanding).  I assure you that this place is stunningly good.
This was my favorite lunch spot in Montreal.  My wife and I were there on a busy Saturday and only waited 5 minutes to be seated.  The system is very simple.  You order your food at the counter in the back then sit down and wait about 15 minutes for it.  I had Le Cubain (ham, braised pork, homemade mayo, and gruyere cheese in a panini) and a bite of my wife's Poulet de Grain Cajun (chicken, guacamole, tomatoes, mango fraiche and cajun spices).  Both were delicious with lots flavors going on and a little kick from the spices.  We each had a glass of their vanilla lemonade too.  I'd never had vanilla lemonade so I didn't know what to expect but I liked it.When you're done you pay at the register while getting an almond croissant to go.  You must not leave without one!  Especially if it's Saturday because they're closed on Sundays.  Their croissant flat out embarrasses the Almost Twist bread at Taipan Bakery in Flushing.
Wait, is this place for real? Excellent prices? And right in the heart of tourist country?  Score.  This place was really busy the day I dropped in with some friends.  The wait was short for a table and we got three different sandwiches (the veggie one with coppocolla (s/w), the cuban, and the cajun).  All the sandwiches were really tasty with the veggie/cured ham sandwich being my favorite.  The salad was full of great fresh vegetables and dill.  We were all kind of full but we split a blueberry tart, which was good, but not my fav. One person at the table ordered an allongée (coffee) and it looked and smelled so amazing, that the other two got one as well.  The inside of the place has a great atmosphere and les prix sont corrects. You should definitely check it out.
We stopped here for a mid-afternoon snack and got espresso and various sweets.  The espresso was full and strong, the way I like it.  I had the turtle bar, which was a decadent calorie bomb made of shortbread, salted caramel, and chocolate ganache.  Freaking amazing.  My mouth just filled with saliva thinking about it.  My friend got this shortcake thing with whipped cream and fresh blueberries, which was also really good and not that heavy or sweet (opposite of my dessert), so there's a dessert here for everyone.  They also have sandwiches and savory snacks for a nice lunch.TIP:  They are closed Sundays and Mondays!!
Just as good as you think. Fun atmosphere, delicious pastries, great service. The wait is often long. I recommend trying breakfast (early - before 9am) to avoid long waits. There is one hot breakfast option (like an egg sandwich with fontina mmmm) and all the amazing pastries you could want. I like the apricot, white chocolate and nut brioche. Very close to the Pointe a Calliere Archeology museum for out of town guests.
Oh my, this place. I don't even know how to begin.At least 3 friends recommended O+G to us when we mentioned about our trip to Montreal. One of them even went back 3 times on their last visit. We had to go, right? We were completed shocked by how good the food was. That includes the sandwiches, salads, pastries and drinks. So what happened? In a short few days trip to Montreal, we went back the second time just to have other food on the menu. It was one of the best restaurant experiences we'd had in Montreal, or in fact, the world. Sounds exaggerated? I know but we do feel that way. Get used to it.We tried a bunch of sandwiches: Le Cubaine, Cajun chicken, vegan and pomodoro. We also ordered the extravagant tomato plate with this crazily addictive crouton bits drenched in sun-dried tomato infused olive oil. They are beyond good, the flavour of the dishes screamed extravagant. They have a full spectrum of tastes and flavours.The special drinks: sweet lemon tea and vanilla strawberry lemonade, were both excellent companion to the off-the-chart flavourful sandwiches.Be sure to go before 2-2:30 on a weekday because some sandwiches will be sold out around that time.I would not mind taking a 7-hour drive to Montreal just to eat a panini at O+G, like, today.
I was recommended to this place by the concierge at the Hyatt Regency.   She said that it was not a very far walk from the hotel.   For a Los Angeles native that drives everywhere, she was wrong.  It was a very long walk.  The July weather was hot and humid in the morning.   I built up a very nice sweat going there.   I ordered a couple of croissants, a fruity bread, and a Latte.  I then started my hike back to the hotel.  I gave up.  I caught a taxi.  $8 later, I was back at the hotel.   All the breads were good.  The latte came in a small cup.   I needed more of a caffeine fix, so I had to buy another cup of coffee from somewhere else.  A nice little gem in Montreal.
We came here for lunch on a beautiful day, so of course, the wait was unbelievably long so we decided to get it to go.  The menu is only in french, but the people are helpful and translate the menu for you.  I had the Viva las Vegan, it was very tasty, but huge! I could have done with just half of a sandwich.  It is a bit on the pricey side for a sandwich, but they use quality ingredients.  The water is a quick walk away, so if you order to go, take a stroll down there and sit on the picnic benches to enjoy your meal.
Very good cafe. We had to wait about 30 minutes on Saturday, so prepare yourself for a wait. We walked by this place on Friday and could have gotten in right away. You can also just walk to the pastry counter for a quick purchase. We did that while waiting and the almond croissant was the best. I had Le cubain, which was very tasty. The bread was crunchy yet soft. GF had provenciale with tuna which is served cold. Even though it was cold, it was also tasty.
We were visiting Montreal as tourists, so having breakfast at this place was exactly what we were looking for. It's in the Old City; you'll want to stroll around the neighborhood and work up an appetite. The ambience is funky. The place seemed to be filled with locals, so we really felt like we were having a true Vieux Montreal experience. The service was friendly and prompt. The food was very good and prices were reasonable.
I am absolutely in lurve with Olive et Gourmando.  I am still dreaming about the Viva Las Vegan, drooling as I gaze at a picture of it on Foodspotting: foodspotting.com/places/… .  Tofu, pickles, veggies, hummus, the most perfect bread I've ever tasted; you get the picture.I think everyone else in Montréal feels the same way, because this joint is always packed.  But don't let the ridiculous crowd at the front door deter you from getting your lunch.  Getting a seat may take some patience, but if you're placing a to-go order, you'll be in and out in a jiff.  The line is split into two portions: the folks clogging the front door are all waiting for specialty drink orders or maybe an entire cake or something.  Dunno.  I just know it didn't have anything to do with me, so, shrug.  Squeeze through them and make your way to the second line, near the menu board.  Place your order there, then turn around and join the other line---you'll see it; it's still not the mob at the door).If you're ordering a salad or a sandwich to go, they'll usually have it ready-made, so all you have to do is stand with your order in the line to pay.  At the register, do yourself a favor and add a croissant aux amandes to your order.  Holy freaking hell.I can also recommend the chai tea.  You also place your coffee and tea orders separately from your sandwich / salad order: you'll see the barista person in between the two lines.  Yeah, it's a weird setup, but for the most part it works.I love the super-cute hipster staff.  Even when they're stressed and busy, they're still very sweet.So, yes, like I said, the Viva Las Vegan will knock your socks off, as will the croissant aux amandes.  If I'm being honest here, I ate two of each on this most recent business trip to Montréal.  After which I promptly hit the gym for two hours.  Worth it!
First time to Montreal, and this was the third eatery visited.  The other two were very good, but breakfast at Olive et Gourmando prompted me to write a review.  My order only consisted of the Housemade Ricotta "sweet" and an espresso, but the ambiance, service, presentation and flavour of the simple dish were exactly what I needed on this Wednesday morning.  Our timing was great, as it was not too busy.  That may have helped my experience, however I will definitely be trying this place for lunch very soon.
Hey...you looking for a good bakery? You want a good pastry or two? You want a cinnamon bun, or a garlicy corn bread muffin, or a yummy cookie? This is the place for you!Oh hell yeah! I would come here again in a heart beat.  here is the thing, though. They don't have bread here. So don't come looking for a baguette!
Reminds me of my fav place in Connecticut, Caseus. It has casual and relaxing yet hip atmosphere. It gets very crowded though so beware. I had an amazingly good truffle mac and cheese which came with a green salad with toasted sliced almonds. I got a chocolate chip cookies with pecans to go and it was very good.
My friends and I ventured into O&G during a recent vacation to Montreal, following up on a recommendation in a Lonely Planet guidebook.  My bf & I split the cuban sandwich, essentially a panini that was delicious with a creamy, spicy sauce.  Our friends had the chèvre chaud (hot goat cheese) with caramelized onion and house-made ketchup, the latter of which was slightly sweet and a perfect compliment to the salty, cheesy sandwich.  But the star of the show was the soupe du jour.  When the server described it to me--barley, corn, etc--I was less than enraptured.  But I am SO glad we tried it anyway!  It had such a delicious, unique flavor... I'm guessing a result of dill and lime in the mix.  It was easily the best soup I've ever had.  We capped off the meal with an almond pastry, gooey, delicious and fresh.  If you're ever in Vieux Montréal, do NOT miss this place!
It is crowded, noisy and worth it. I had the potato  chowder and hot cheese sandwich. They were both excellent. I refuse to call it grilled cheese because that doesn't do the sandwich justice. Go! Wait the line. You won't be sorry!
Was put onto this place by a waitress at liverpool house, and she was right to rave about it.Read all the good reviews because they are all true. make sure you ask them how it works first, namely: you get a table; you order from the bar (front or back); they serve; you enjoy.All they are really missing is some kind of terrace, cause i could sit here all day and people watch.
A must visit cafe in Montreal.. It's busy so get there early... Go for breakfast, arrive when it opens cause people know this cafe! Wonderful breakfast: home-made ricotta with citrus honey and toast, breakfast panini and of course latte. We had to select some pastries to take with us... The crispest croissant with a buttery soft interior....  So wished I lived closer. Staff friendly with great customer relations.
Croissants!  Croissants!  You really can't go wrong with any croissant in Montreal, but I have a new soft spot for the cheese croissants from Olive et Gourmando.It's a little, yet spacious-enough-to-allow-a-decent-sized-crowd type of a place, and it's located sort of in between downtown and Old Port - if I recall correctly.  I *think* it was near the Square Victoria metro station.I love the street it's on, as it's a narrow path with tall buildings lining it, and this shop is right on the corner.  The first thing you can do is get in line.  Then, you can drool over the display of breads and sweets they have behind the short glass in front of you.  Seriously, I was a bit peeved that I had to actually make a decision!  I saw "croissant de frommage" and if I learned any French while in Quebec it was the word for cheese.  I asked if I could get a breakfast sandwich made with that croissant and she said no.  Shucks!  Anyway,  I figured the cheese croissant would have a center-fill of cheese.  I also got an almond croissant.  Once you order, they tell you they'll bring everything to your seat.  You will pay afterward.  It didn't take long and the croissants arrived, with a latte (that I also had ordered, but this was just ok...  a bit lukewarm).  I tore into the cheese croissant and noticed nothing inside.  Hm.  Oh well, it's still a croissant and there ain't nuthin' wrong with that.  But wait, it tastes like cheese.  Ok, get this: They seem to have baked the croissant with the cheese having been kneaded *into* the dough.  So, there was cheesy goodness in every bite!  Because of that, the croissant was not overly flaky, but chewy and soft and buttery and complete perfection.  I didn't want it to end.  Oh, and they cover it with sesame seeds.  Yum.  The almond croissant is also incredible and truly almondy!  It just depends on if you want something sweet or savory.  Neither is wrong.I sat against the "bar table" by the window, with stools.  It's probably where most of my seating was during this trip.  Loved looking outside while simultaneously relishing in delicious culinary experiences.  Once you're done, you get back in line to pay - and tell them where you sat.  I'm not sure how the heck they keep track of all this, but they know.  For a couple of croissants and a latte, it wasn't even $10.  I believe the croissants were $2.50 or $2.75.  I ended up getting back in line to buy some more to take back home with me.  My dad ate them all for breakfast, and didn't leave any for my mom.  By the way: They keep well in the paper package, and even when accidentally put in the fridge, they still are fine once you bring back to room temp.  Well, my dad said they were not only fine, but outrageously awesome.  Service is nice, but the cashier got confused by me a time or two.  It's ok, it's not the first time I'm not understood. :-D  I'll be back to try lunch here.  Next trip back..  Can't wait.
Had a wonderful lunch at this place.  Foodies rejoice!  The food is delicious mix of complex flavors and deliciousI I had a panini that was really as perfect as they come in terms of taste, texture and temperature.  I loved it.  My partner had a sandwich with smoked trout that days later she referenced as the high point in the food of our trip.We got there for lunch on a saturday and the place was packed with lots of people waiting.  The wait wasn't too long (15 minutes or so).  We sat at a counter, and the place was bustling.  If I had to ding it for one thing, it would be that the place seems too full, too busy.  You order by sitting down and then going to a counter in the back to look at the offerrings and place your order.  I doubt you'll have a choice, but if you can, don't sit near the line that forms by the ordering place as you'll feel even more crowded as we did.  But the ordering line goes fast, and the people there are very helpful (even though we felt a bit rushed by the line).We enjoyed the location of the place, with horse-drawn-carriages passing by the window, light snow falling outside, gas lamps and solid old buildings around made for a very romantic setting.We recommend waiting until after your meal to go up to the other counter and get a pastry and some coffee for dessert.  Lots of yummy stuff and great coffee.A note about the star rating:  The food is really as good as it gets for what we wanted ( a not too expensive, but delicious and upscale (dare we say hipster) place.  So I'm giving it a 5 star.  I would have given it a 4 and a half because of the way the service works and the feeling of being rushed, but any food that sticks in your mind as a high water mark is deserving of 5 stars.Bottom line:  Looking for complex, delicious food?  Willing to pay a bit more than average and looking for an upscale, urban elite vibe?  This is it!
I would give this place a 5 for food and maybe a 2.5-3 for dining experience.  I have been here three times, and I think I might be done for awhile.I know it is really popular, and I expect to wait 45-60 minutes to get a table after putting your name in.  But, really, to then wait again in a line to order your food at the back counter?  That second wait was about 15-20 people deep, all crowding everyone else eating at tables.  When they bring you the yummy food, you are probably going to be crowded as well.  When you want to pay... guess what?  You get to wait in line at the front counter to do that.  Three waits seems excessive even for a really good Cuban sandwich and the world's most amazing raspberry lime-aid.  (Aside note: I have a rule that I don't drink calories except for alcohol, but I break it for this stuff.  Which is not to say I wouldn't put vodka in it if I could).  Also, while I think Montreal is generally rather expensive, $15 (before tax and tip) for one sandwich and drink is excessive for a cafe.  Add tax and tip, and you've got a $75-80 dollar lunch for four people.  Four drinks, four sandwiches only.  (Second aside note: it is not helpful that I just ate at a fantastic Italian place in Munich two weeks before... cocktails, bottle of wine, basil lemonade for the kiddos, salad, two pizzas and two pastas for 80 Euros, so the comparison is not great.)I accept the fact that perhaps I am old and the aforementioned is not a big deal to 20-somethings.  I don't think I need to come back unless it were a really nice day, and I ordered take-out to eat at one of the picnic areas on the river, which would be a far preferable dining experience.  (And only one line involved.)
What? Cuban sandwich?  Drools... I'm speechless. I need to turn the chef or chefs into my BFF !I can't even explain the flavor explosion of this sandwich, I feel like I'm insulting this masterpiece by calling it a sandwich. It is seriously the best sandwich ( so sorry to call you that ) I've ever tasted. I wish they would open another one closer to where I live. The place is very busy but worth the wait. Yes 10$ or so for just a sandwich with no sides is a little more pricey then other places but you owe it to your soul to try this little miracle. I do want to try the other things they have but it's soo hard, I can't neglect the Cuban I just can't !!!Are you convinced yet? I could keep going if you like, in fact I could write a poem about it, it's that good. Olive and GourmandoI love your Cuban sandwich I'd eat 10 in a rowAnd I know I would finishI crave it night and dayIt is seriously the bestIt drives me nuts that wayI can't even try the rest !
I had an excellent salad here while exploring Montreal. The system for ordering/eating in was a bit new to me, but everything worked well, and the service was friendly and helpful. Very cute interior. Vegan sandwich option on the menu was a plus for me. The selection of baked goods, granola, and seasoned nuts to-go was extensive, and everything looked great. I'll definitely try these next time.
Food is DELICIOUS here!! well worth the wait.   Have passed by this place several times and its always packed. Went here w a few friends- a great lively place to hang out w friends and enjoy good food and ambiance.
Love this little spot! Although very crowded, the breakfast sandwich and the cuban (a bit on the salty side for some people) are amazing! Homemade ricotta was super yummy also. Best to go during weekdays when it's not packed with people to enjoy some tea and a brioche.
Stumbled upon this place and was pleasantly surprised. A long line outside, locals and tourists. Put our name in and waited about 15 minutes for a table around noon. We ordered a Cuban and another panini with asparagus, pesto, cheese, and capicollo (can't remember the name). Both were amazing! Definitely recommend them. We also had the raspberry lemonade and ginger tea, which were refreshing. The staff was very friendly. Everyone from the hostess to the cashier at the end.Wish we would have discovered it earlier on our trip as we would have loved to try a pastry for breakfast. If we ever make it back to Montreal, we will definitely come back here.
Olive et Gourmando is exactly the type of little cafe that I wish I had in my town. When you enter you're greeted by a tantalizing display of baked goods, along with a chalkboard menu of coffee drinks. But you can also sit down for a light meal if you wish. When I told the hostess I wanted to have lunch, she reserved me a seat in the front window and directed me toward the counter at the back of the restaurant. Here, another chalkboard listed several sandwiches. But the one that I chose was the truite fume. There were also salads and side dishes. I ordered a salade verte to accompany my sandwich, then went to enjoy my seat at the window and wait for my lunch. The salad and sandwich both were generously sized. The sandwich was a truly delicious combination of smoked trout mixed with capers, sun-dried tomatoes, and red onions, and then layered between the two halves of a grilled white bread round with herbed cream cheese and fresh spinach leaves. The mixture of saltiness and smokiness balanced by the cream cheese was fantastic. The salad was equally fabulous. I'd expected a plain green salad but what I got was so much better, though still deliciously simple: a combination of watercress, parsley, and mâché covered with a lot of toasted slivered almonds and dressed with a light vinaigrette. Both dishes were wonderfully delectable--easily the best salad and sandwich I've had in a long time. Maybe ever. On the way out I couldn't resist getting a palmier to go. As I later discovered, this too was excellent. I'm used to palmier that are simply buttery and sweet, but this one went to the next level. The sugar had actually caramelized, coating the entire cookie in a slightly burnt caramel goodness. If there were an Olive et Gourmando at home, I'd never need to eat anywhere else.
Fantastic experience;  amazing pastries and sandwiches.  Love the latte.  Great service.
Good patisseries
SO GOOD! My boyfriend and I stopped in here for lunch a couple days ago after spending an hour or so at the Biosphere (we actually meant to go to the Biodome but we mixed them up, ended up there, and were very disappointed to realize that we were in the wrong place and there were no penguins).  We got off the Metro at Square-Victoria and walked just a few blocks to get to O + G. They don't have a big sign out front, so for a second we thought we had gone to the wrong place....again. :) But alas, we were in the right place!There was a line and we did have to wait about 15-20 minutes, but it was well worth it. The atmosphere was lovely despite the general hubbub. You order at the counter and they bring you the food. The menu is posted on a chalkboard and is written solely in French, so I had to do a little translating for my boyfriend before we could decide. As long as you have a basic knowledge of food-related French words, you'll be okay - Oh, and they do have some handy little chalk drawings surrounding each entree so you can get some clues that way. We got the goat cheese panini and it was deeeeeeeee-lish! I'm usually not a big fan of caramelized onions, but this sandwich was seriously good. The homemade ketchup was really yummy and added a lot of flavor. We also got a bag of kettle style dill pickle chips, which they bring to you in a basket. I also ordered a raspberry limeade, which they make themselves, and it was simply divine! Both of us were very impressed with the food and absolutely loved the sandwiches. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Montreal.
Worth every star I gave them! Good service, great food, and fun vibe! Their pastries  are great, egg in your face sandwich was good, service was prompt and polite. My only complain would be that the tables were too close! But that's in all the restaurants here in Montreal.
Yum, yum, yum! Had lunch here on a local friend's recommendation . The Cuban sandwich was beyond delicious, ginger ice tea was great, pastries were perfect. Perfect place for a quick lunch in olde Montreal .
Got sandwiches to go. Had the chicken sandwich. It was excellent with chicken, guacamole, tomato and mango on wonderful bread. Took them to the park for a picnic. Line was very long for tables but moved smoothly to order food and to pay.
The only thing that disappointed me about this restaurant was the fact that I didn't find it till the last day I was in Montreal.  I probably would have eaten there multiple times had I known.Love the atmosphere, it's loud with talking/laughing and the ages of the crowd are mixed. Seemed to have been packed with locals (always a good sign)... Had a glass of rosé and a hot panini: The Goat Cheese - Carmelized onions, goat cheese and homemade ketchup... Finished off with a latte and an apple turnover with cinnamon sugar.  Yum, will go back daily when in Montreal next.
Excellent food and great location in beautiful old Montreal.  Plus, cafe staff is amazingly helpful and friendly!!!!!
The food here is fresh and delicious, I never thought I would enjoy a veggie sandwich so much.  The trout sandwich I had here was also pretty good, and the soups and bakery items looked and smelled incredible.The worst thing about this place is how incredibly busy it is.  It's always packed, with people waiting outside on the street since it's pretty tiny.  They also have a weird semi-table-service method where you get seated, but then order at the counter with a ticket, then a server comes out to deliver the food (eventually).  Then, you get up and pay the cashier.  I guess they don't want to shout out order numbers.As a lunch option, it's one of the best light meals in the Old Town.  I personally liked Le Cartet better, but this place is good.
Olive et Gourmando is part of the hip renessaince in Old Montreal. There is a set of new stores and new culinary destinations making names for themselves. Olive et Gourmand is an affordable gourmet sandwich spot amongst this revival.Upon entering, a place to sit and eat is picked for you and you move to the back to order your sandwich. There are several options daily, using fresh ingredients until they run out. I chose the Chevre Chaud, which was an answer to the American grilled cheese. It was a pain blanc bun with chevre and caramelized onions, and then grilled on a panini. The bread was perfectly white and fluffy with a good panini formed crust on the outside. The cheese on the edges also became toasted and caramelized.  It was served with a homemade ketchup dipping sauce, analogous to tomato soup but served cold, a bit thicker, and a bit sweeter. It was the perfect counter balance to the chevre and the caramelized onions in the sandwich. The delightful sauce sunk into the sandwich like a glorious edible sponge. Each bite is a treat for the palette.I loved Olive et Gourmando so much that I returned the following day.
Cheese Croissant - addictive!Almond Croissant - dense and flavourful (though a bit heavy for my tastes).Latte - the coffee was fragrant and the milk was smooth..the best latte I've had in Montreal!Going back to try their poached egg breakfast sandwich...may upgrade to 5 stars!
The first time we walked by Olive et Gourmando, you could hear the din walking down the street.  I thought that we were happening upon an uber-cool bar, but it was a Saturday afternoon when we stumbled by.  We made a mental note to try Olive et Gourmando for breakfast instead, since sometimes busy restaurants don't work with our active toddler.  The second time we went by, my high school French failed me as I was wondering why they weren't open, though the sign said 8 to 6.  Well, just don't go on a Monday!  We ended up at Titanic instead.   In the end, I sent my husband and brother to pick up many things to nosh on the way the flight home.  Apparently I was spared the crowd, surprising for a week day!  The goods were quite decent and my favourite was the rhubarb and ginger muffin.  They had no morning glory muffins, sadly.  The chocolate brioche wasn't as sweet as a chocoholic would hope for, but it was Valhrona so high quality chocolate at least.  The almond croissant was much sweeter.  My brother apparently didn't like his egg sandwich, but my husband did.  I think they spent about $50 on a variety of items that I lugged to the airport.  Everything was individually placed in a bag, which sported huge butter stains.  :)  Just the sort of thing you need on vacation.  I'd do it again if I had the chance.
I was here again during the summer. The place was crowded with not only many people, but also many flies and some wasps. The baked goods section was swarming with them. I had to keep swatting them away from me as I was paying at the counter. It was just so disgusting and revolting. No one working there seemed to notice or care. They merely asked if I wanted any baked goods. No way. Not with that degree of insects around.
We ate a breakfast and lunch here. The food is very good. I had the mushroom soup and a panini and it was tasty. It was a little too much food. The cafe latte and croissants were great. I would definitely stop here again. It is very busy on the weekends, but the wait was worth it.
I very happily stumbled upon Olive et Gourmando as I was walking through the Old Port.  Its humble facade does not nearly do justice to the goodness inside.  I was promptly seated at the counter near a lovely open window filled with fresh herb, tomato and pepper plants that no doubt are used in their dishes. They serve various sweet and savoury breads, along with hot and cold panini and several delicious looking salads.  I had Le Cubain panini (a typical Cuban) and the apple salad that was to die for!  Oh, the humanity!  I love that they brought me a whole bottle (branded as such) de l'eau. I find that when I dine alone, those things are usually reserved.  I also had the chocolate brownie which had huge chunks of chocolate in it.  It was good, but not the best I've ever had.  The food was good, the atmosphere was fantastic and the staff was very helpful even though I was only able to speak rudimentary French!  Note: OeG takes cash or debit ONLY, but they nicely tell you that before they seat you.
Primarily a lunch spot, it also has gained some fame for their pastries and breads. Understandably so. The wait to eat in, even at 1:30 on a Friday was nearly half an hour, but it's totally worth it. They have a daily soup (Roasted pepper the day I was there. Drat) and a selection of both hot and cold sandwiches. There are also daily salad selections to choose from. I went pretty simply and got the Smoked Trout sandwich, consisting of  hot-smoked trout, capers, sun-dried tomatoes, spinach and herbed cream cheese. It was really quite good. The smokiness of the trout blended so well with the rest of the ingredients and oh man, the bread. This is a great example of what a sandwich should be. Together in this way, the ingredients offer a taste palate you wouldn't get from any other incarnation. The man next to me was determinedly devouring their Cuban sandwich, a favorite apparently. He sure looked pleased. On my way out I grabbed what turned out to be the best latte I've had in recent memory and a palmier pastry to nibble on later. I would go out of my way to grab a pastry here in the mornings.   Did I mention to can get everything à porter (take away)? I wish I was closer!
Delicious, try the brioche pecan, uhm, the chocolate one is also good. The coffee is good too coming  Mirage espresso machine. The environment is very nice. I would go back every time I visit Montreal.
This place reminds me of Paul Maison - a cafe I found in South Beach Miami. Both are little Parisian-esque cafeterias that showcase delightful bakeries and serve gourmet sandwiches made-to-order in a casual semi self-serve style. Coincidentally, Olive et Gourmando is on Rue Saint-Paul Ouest...huh, look at that.Cubain...zesty! Roll crevettes + crabe Chevre Chaud with homemade ketchup   Olive et Gourmando is a smaller, less polite version - I found one server scary, and I'm pretty scary myself.  You are directed to a seat and then given a sheet of paper.  You take it and head to the back to order. My sister and I got there late, what with our stop at Jeans Jeans Jeans!  By the time we arrived, they were sold out of the sandwich I wanted - egg on your face - booyah!  I feel like it needs to be followed with a booyah and two-finger gun shot motion?!?  I opted for the Chevre Chaud aka grilled goat cheese while my sister ordered the Cuban.  Then we decided to share the shrimp and crab roll. A little well-known fact for you: the average sister duo would share two sandwiches...but we above-average oinkers share three plus dessert.  All in all, the sandwiches-paninis-whatever you want to call them were very good, although the shrimp roll did not hold a candle to our mom's.  Our mother makes the BEST sandwiches in the world - her homemade chicken salad and shrimp sandwiches kick ass.For dessert I got the turtle bar which my sister could only nibble at because it had nuts.  Whoops, I'm still getting used to the fact she's avoiding nuts.  Poor sister recently discovered she may be allergic to them and it's still under investigation. It's really sad. Like, really sad. Our family is like animal kingdom, when you tell a pig she can't eat something, the jungle cries.All in all, I liked Olive et Gourmando; it may have been good-er if it wasn't so pricey. We finished off our plates and walked off the calories around Old Montreal. I want to go back to try the Apple turnover and egg on your face...but this time I will be sure not to be trop tard...Olive et Gourmando is trendy and fashionable, but a little high maintenance, huh, sounds a little like me *wink*.
I had the mac and cheese, which both my girlfriend and I thought was delicious.  The place is intimate and in the heart of old Montreal.  If you are driving, there is decent pay parking on the street.  You may have to wait 20-30 minutes as we did on our first visit.  The staff is very friendly and generally accommodating.  I wasn't too impressed with the vegan Panini.  If you're thinking about desserts. I'd try the cronuts diagnolly across the street...but I don't remember the name of the cafe.  I gave it four stars but I don't feel this is a must during a visit to Montreal.
Had the raspberry muffin and it was delicious and fresh.  Well, it better be for $3.50.  The chocolate croissant was crispy but I've had much better in Montreal and in other cities.
By Day 3 of my recent trip to Montreal, I was beginning to doubt the city's culinary ability.  After reading all the hype on Yelp, I had pretty high expectations...being a food snob, I still went in with a critical mouth.  I wish I could give a 4.5, but only because I want to challenge myself to find something even better than this on my next visit.At 10 on a Monday morning, this place was full - I can only imagine weekends.  We were instantly sat, though, and our "waitress" took extra time explaining the process of ordering pastries/coffee at the front, and sandwiches in the back.  Not wanting to completely overdo it, my friend and I split a sandwich which had THE BEST oven-roasted tomatoes, making the $10 worth it.  I had a latte and almond croissant and would easily have devoured twice as much.  It took all my will power not to order a cheese croissant to go.
Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Everything is superb. The food quality, the preparation, the service. Everything is top notch. I love the "egg on your face" sandwich the most. Truly an elevated egg sandwich.
Olive et Gourmando is the perfect place for breakfast.  The display of baked goods at the counter is mouth watering, atmosphere super comfortable, and service is friendly and efficient.I had a latte and a brioche de pomme et cannelle.  It was like eating a delicious cinnamon bun with less yucky frosting and more natural flavors of apples whose pieces you can actually find in the brioche. My husband had a "tartelicious," a flatbread looking square pastry with some sort of berry on top.  Good coffee, good pastries, and the sandwiches listed in the deli part of the cafe looked really good too.
Great spot for breakfast or lunch in Old Montreal. We arrived at 1 pm on a Saturday and only had to wait about 20 minutes even though it was very crowded. It was definitely worth it!  We had mushroom mac n' cheese (delicious) and ricotta with honey (also great). We also tried a croissant, since they are supposed to be excellent, but it was a little disappointing. The service was fast and friendly and the decor was lovely. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone who visits Montreal.
Yum, still dreaming about the tofu hummus sandwich... If it came with a small side salade it would be a 5*, but very good casual place.
Arrived on a Friday early afternoon for brunch and ran into quite a crowd here.  Tables are small and they refused to combine two 2-people tables for a party of three.  Instead, they insisted on squeezing in the third person on the side.  Since the tables are small to begin with, and quite cozily spaced, this was a problem because we kept getting bumped by people passing to look at the offering on the counters.  Table service was cold but the people behind the counters were very helpful and pleasant.  Everyone spoke English.  The food was good but not mind-blowing.  Also, it was overpriced for the quantity, especially things like salad.  The sandwiches, however, were very delicious and were carefully constructed using exotic and fresh ingredients.  I also really liked the focacia du jour, which they panini press and call "pizza-style."  It was warm, gooey and delicious.As a tip, order the glass of coffee instead of the cup.  It's only $.50 more but more than double the quantity.
This place is very cute. It's small with limited seating. The menu takes typical sandwiches and salads and kicks it up a notch with their own unique twist to add flavor. We enjoyed everything we ordered. Grilled Chicken Sandwich with guacamole, mango, tomato on flat bread. Caesar Salad with chicken, bacon, croutons. They also have a take out section where you can get everything to go including everything on the menu, coffee, and trail mixes. They have a very good vegetarian selection on their menu Tofu sandwiches as well as soba noodle salad with peanut dressing. This place takes CASH ONLY.
Arrived at ~1:30 on a Friday to a 20 minute wait.  TOTALLY worth it.  The leek and potato soup was delicious, my grilled sandwich excellent and my wife's soba salad amazing.This is the type of place we would have returned to 2 or 3 times during a short visit to a new city, but there are just too many other Montreal institutions to try.
This review is from memory, so it's vague, but I had the best organic sandwich and tea at this place.  You can taste the ingredients in the food and it is oh so delicious.  I was convinced I had found the new culinary center of the world without jumping on a plane. love it!
Everyone I know that's been to Montreal, raves about Olive + Gourmando. For the sake of Yelp, and my appetite, I had to go. And yes, it's amazing.O & G has a charming, Paris-like cafe feel. Wood tables, freshly baked goods on display, delicious smells and classic but funky decor. The place was packed (so be prepared for a bit of a wait), but you're assigned a table number when one becomes available and then go stand in line to place a food order. If you're looking for take-out, that's also an option and you stand in the same line to place an order.They have about 9 sandwiches written on chalkboards above the food displays - my memory is failing me, but they were all classic with a twist. Chicken with pesto and roasted red peppers, caramelized onions with some sort of meat....something spicy. My apologies for the vague descriptions, but I guarantee they were delicious and fresh.  They also have an array of fresh salads, fruit salads, and  REALLY good fresh breads & spreads. I had the ricotta cheese with a yummy olive oil and parsley, cherry tomatoes and warm bread with a garlic-y glaze. It was delicious, and great to share.We also tried the baked goods (how could we not), and tried a butter croissant, banana loaf, and a mixed fruit and nut muffin. All fresh, all delish.The lattes were just another bonus, and added a nice touch to our lovely brunch. Located in the heart of old Montreal, this is a must-visit restaurant! All the rave reviews, are accurate!
This place is awesome. They also have a great idea.  You go up to the counter and order your food, sit down, eat, then pay right before you leave.  I think that this definitely speeds things up a lot.  I got the trout sandwich with kapers, herb cream cheese, spinach, and onions and it was delicious.  I could tell that the bread was fresh and homemade.Loved it!
Boulangerie Chari in Brussels, Belgium has the second best almond croissants the world over; the best can be found herein. Hands down. And I'm a connoisseur of this particular food, as it's my dietary Achilles heel. Also of note are: all their other pastries. I asked, and they can't ship to the united states. BUT, they're worth bribing your friends to bring em home for you. Oh yes they are!
What can I say about this place that hasn't already been said?? Easily the best food I've had in Montreal. I had the mac & cheese, which was perfect. The mushrooms gave it a wonderful savory taste and the texture was something I didn't know I wanted until I had it. The accompanying salad was light enough on the dressing and very, very fresh. Well worth the trip downtown for me and I will be back.The only issue was price. My lunch for one of the mac and cheese, a small soda, and an almond croissant came to about $21. There was a lunch rush but as a single, I didn't have to wait at all for a seat at the counter.
We got there for lunch at 4pm on Friday.  The place was packed even though they close at 5pm!  The place has a great vibe... loved it!  The food was excellent.  We got the Cubain Hot Panini and Cream of Squash soup.  Yummm!
Relaxed and warm atmosphere. I didn't try the sandwiches but the patisserie was so delicious
Chocolate Croissant is amazing
Read about this place in the Chicago Guide magazine and decided we must come to Montreal and try this place and so here we are! OMG... Best sandwich ever (ok..there is Ike's in San Francisco that is a Best as well, but different) .. I don't even think we should call it a sandwich... Panini... it sounds better .... this place serves the most out of the world Panini... the Cuban is the best... ok, we loved the Cajun chicken as well.. (and I don't normally go out of my way for sandwiches) Not sure the spread they use but it is delicious.... of course we had to try their croissant... it's on the smaller side, but I like it because it is not filled with tons of butter! The exterior is perfectly crusty, and the interior is soft. It's probably the first time I had a croissant and not feel heavy. We came at 11 and that seems to be the perfect time. Anything after 11:15, you will probably stand in the line.
LOVEEEED this place! No wonder there are so many reviews and so many positive 5 stars. We came here on a Saturday afternoon during our stay in Montreal and came back on our last day before the airport because it was just that good. On Saturday afternoon it was packed, with locals, tourists, you name it, so we had to wait like a half an hour to get a table, but it was definitely worth it. The second time we came was on a Wednesday around the same time and the wait was only 15 minutes so it really depends, but expect to wait a little. Now, onto the food, it was superb, the Cuban sandwich, toasted, warm, gooey, a lil spicy, was oh em gee delicious. Now onto the pastries, we had both the almond croissant and the tangy blueberry tart, and they were both spectacular, I felt like I got them from the streets of Paris, they were just that good. The next day we came back and tried the Cajun chicken sandwich and the goat cheese, caramelized onion with spicy ketchup one, and once again, filled with soo much flavor. I don't think you can go wrong with any item on the menu, from the drinks, sandwiches, pastries, all are top notch. The atmosphere is buzzing as well, making it much more enjoyable and fun. We loved it here and def. recommend it for all the foodies.
Lovely, lovely little lunch spot!The wait can be long (or they will tell you it's long and turns out to be quick!). Order in the back and food/drink is brought to your table. Very interesting lunch menu . . . good selection . . . nice wine/beer. Very delectable little treats at the front where you pay your bill.Staff are nice, hip, and available!
fantastic! i read some great reviews on here and decided to go for breakfast. we didn't have to wait at all to get seated, and the service was really nice. you have to order your own food at a counter, which they deliver to you. i ordered the brioche with cheesecake and raspberry swirls and the turtle bar. both were equally delicious.the decor in the place was quirky and fun, and the atmosphere was relaxed. the open windows allow for you to stare out onto the streets while you eat your food (not that i do that...) and sitting at the communal tables lets you listen in on other people's conversations (not that i do that either).all in all, an awesome place to eat. definitely going there again.
I don't think anyone needs me to tell them what to think of Olive et Gourmando. This is a Montreal institution and definitely worth a visit. One of my favorite cafes, in fact, because of the quality of the food. But its success is its weak spot. It gets rather chaotic and crowded - so not a place where you can usually enjoy a beverage or a snack in tranquility. They have servers who bring your food and drinks, but they make everyone crowd around the cashier to order and then you have to queue up a second time to pay after eating. (Why?) Some of the pleasure of visiting is lost by the whole "process" you have to go through.
A must go to place for breakfast, brunch or lunch in Vieux Quebec.  My wife found it extremely "cute" and fell in love with the place.  If you go around 11 you will be in good shape for an early lunch or brunch.  Breakfast did not seem to be much of a jam on the weekday we went (we went twice by the way). All the pastries are wonderful, especially the cheese biscuit which has a little cayenne kick to it.  Wifey loved the cuban panini.  I thought the filling was great but I personally am not a big fan of overly toasted bread (not burnt).  That being said, I would order one of their paninis again any day and love to devour some cheese biscuits for dessert.  And do yourself a favor and get a large cappucino.Not really that expensive in comparison to all the tourist traps you could get sucked into in the Old City.
The granola and yogurt is a great breakfast option. Perfect cappuccino and if you're feeling indulgent, try the chocolate brioche!
As an owner of a bakery cafe my wife and always look at other cafes for ideas and inspirations. When were blown away by the simple elegance of the gourmand. The food, drink and service was top notch from start to finish.  We also ate at some of the more "up scale" restaurants while in Montreal (XO, etc..) and we always found ourselves looking forward to our next meal at the gourmand. The love and energy always came through with everything we ate. This place is a MUST VISIT but come early if you want to have a selection
Very good food and pastries !! You can't be claustrophobic! Definitely will go again!
Best lunch we've had in Montreal!  Their Cajun chicken sandwich is one of the best sandwiches I've EVER had.  It's definitely big enough to share (although you may not want to...). They've got a butterscotch and pecan bar that's phenomenal. My wife loved her almond croissant.
This place is top- notch. We thought it looked cute when we passed by one evening after it closed, so we decided to check it out for lunch. I'm so glad we did. It was probably the most memorable lunch of the trip. I liked that they ran out of the salad we wanted to order because they make everything fresh. It's a restaurant that takes pride in its quality, even if that means they can only make a small quantity of some items. The house charcuterie plate is fabulous. Can't recommend enough.
Delicious, hot sandwiches. Quick seating even though a line out the door. Didn't try the dessert but it looked great.
I really, really miss working in the area because this is my all-time favourite lunch spot. The food is to die for. Everything from the daily lunch sandwiches to the sinfully delicious chocolate-espresso brownies will have you coming back for more. There's nearly always a lineup out the door, and the place is certainly too popular for the limited space available -- especially during lunch hour rush. It can be crowded and a long wait for takeout, and table service is a bit haphazard during busy periods. But the staff handle the crowds with a smile, and the food is so worth it!
Great sandwiches, pastries, soups.
Olive & Gourmando quirkly local place to grab lunch if you're trying to save a buck. They're great for soups, salads, and hot or cold sandwiches which cost about $9. You can even get half a sandwich for half the price! It's a very busy place, especially during lunch time so expect to wait a couple minutes before you get seated. But once you are seated, you order from the counter, and it doesn't take long for servers to bring you your food.They have soups and salads of the day which have unique but fresh and delicious ingredients. My friend had a tasty salad with cooked squash and zucchini. I had the Cuban panini which had ham, braised porc, gruyere cheese, and a delicious mayonaise made with chipotle peppers, pickles, lime, and coriander (I checked their website for the the ingredients if you're wondering. My tongue would not have been able to pick up any of those tastes. All it knows is good or bad). They also have a bakery with cookies and brownies and more. I had a brownie that wasn't half bad, but I've definitely had better.The location is on a lively corner in Old Montreal. You'll see locals and businessmen walking by. There are also boutiques and art galleries galore, so after lunch, you can walk around and entertain yourself.
This was my favorite spot in Montreal.  The food was phenomenal yet not pricey.  Perfect for breakfast or lunch.  The chicken-avocado-mango sandwich.  Yum.  Yum.  Yum.  Go!  You will not be disappointed.
5/5.  Went here four times when we visited here.
The soups here are fantastic. I stumbled upon here when I was on vacation and I will make it a point to go back. I brought home the packaged nuts. So good!
Crowded but the food is heavenly! The restaurant being closed on Mondays seems strange
if there are 10 people waiting to go in this place must be goodand good it was - the sanwich was excellent and so was the croissant and lemon square
*Service (4.5/5)*: As good as it gets from the moment we walked in. Despite the look on the poor hostesses face at our party of 6, she wasted no time asking a dude to move to a stool and put together two tables. They take your orders at the sandwich bar and took the time to help my sisters pick. Within a few minutes of sitting down, we all had water, a glass of quality ice tea and then our sandwiches arrived.*Food (4/5)*: 3 Viva la Vegan, 2 Cajun Chicken, 1 Smoked Trout cold sandwiches. While the selection was limited to 4 out of 6 because we were "too late", said the sign, we all thoroughly enjoyed our cold sandwiches on grilled buns and left full (Erin couldn't even finish, but she's then tiny).*Atmosphere (3.5/5)*: Awesome blend of a metro bistro down in old cobblestone montreal. The atmosphere was a little busy and we felt like we had to give up the table as soon as we were done but with a full day planned that wasn't a problem.*Verdict?*: I'll be coming back for lunch the next time I'm in town.
The best coffee shop in old port and downtown area. If you don't have time to go to cafe Olympico, try this. Gets very crowded at lunch time and has very weird business hours so check before coming. Interesting spot for a flash date or just coffee and croissants in the morning.
Its a very nice old-world style bakery.  It feels very European and the attention to details is high.  We missed out on some of the lunch options because we were there "too late."  The signs hung on the chalkboard menu wall told us "too late" next to most options, so get there early enough if you want a lot of selection.  :)The nice hostess seated us and explained in a very French way how it worked.  "You will sit here.  Go to the back to order.  Tell them you are at station 4 and 5. They will bring it to you and you will pay up front when you are finished."  Hey, at least we knew what to do.  :)  The soba noodle salad was very good, the Elixir green tea drink was also quite nice.  Very clean, they wipe the tables as soon as you leave, and the baked goods looked excellent.  This is my second visit to Montreal   and second visit to this bakery.  :)
Olive et Gourmando is a cozy little cafe that is on the outskirts of the Old Town. It is decorated in a very inviting yet casual way that makes you want to sit there for hours. It is old-fashioned in a way that it has gourmet food on display everywhere, but there is something rustic yet modern that instills trust in me - so I don't have to order something safe on the menu (like the other old town restos). It is sorta split into two with a coffee station and a sandwich station. You sit down at a table which has a little flag with a number, and then when you order, you tell them what number you have. I have had the Cubain there which I think is a Cuban sandwich and has nothing to do with Kurt Cobain. The sandwich here is a pressed sandwich or hot panini with ham, braised pork and gruyere. Very tasty. It is not the biggest sandwich and doesn't come with a side. It makes up for it small size in flavor. My friend ordered a Cesar Salad with chicken which she said was good, although there were only two pieces of chicken in the salad. The food is visually appealing to the point you could have a photo session with it, and so did a man sitting behind my friend. He staggered his bread pieces around his soup (I think it was), and then spent half and hour shooting it. We tried going today at around 4pm on a sunday and it was closed. So you might want to check the opening hours before heading here!
This is a great cafe and bakery in Old Montreal.  The coffee is very good and the food is super fresh and well made.  The servers all are very friendly and welcoming.  My server highly recommended the "morning glory" muffin and it was probably the best muffin I have ever had.  I will definitely come back the next time I am in Montreal.
Fabulous! Loved the sandwiches--had the Cubano and really enjoyed it! The wine selection is good for a cafe. The baked goods are good to à porter. The location is perfect right in the heart of Vieux-Montréal. Stop by if you're in town.
An update: Olive et Gourmando reopened in January 2009 after its usual December-January hiatus with some cosmetic changes to the space, AND the decision not to bake and sell breads anymore. The sandwich breads are still made in-house, but OeG says it wasn't doing enough volume in breads to justify the effort. The rest of the menu is unchanged and still as good as ever.
I'm always impressed when i eat a sandwich and think - even though the ingredients are listed on the  wall, there's no way I could ever put them together in a combination that would be this good... It's baffaling really... House made tea and lemonade also spectacular - cafe americano was quite lovely as well. Avoid the 11-2 Lunch rush - we got there at 3 and still had a 15 minute wait, but well worth it.
Who knows Montreal, knows Olive & Gourmando.  An Old Montreal gem promising the most gratifying sandwhiches, warm home-made soups and fresh elegant salads.  And it is understood that no matter how full you are, a dessert is a must have! With the most enticing selection of baked goods all made in house, you will surely be seduced! This is the go to place for local Old Montrealers, as well as my ultimate recommendation for tourists looking for a great neighbourhood treasure.
The line sucks but this place - from the sandwiches to the sweets to the beverages - is freakin awesome. Good luck picking out just one dessert; I don't think any of your choices could be anything but amazing. If you're willing to take your food to-go, you can be out in 20 minutes rather than waiting 30 for a table. And the food makes an awesome sitting on a bench in the park meal.
This place is expensive.we had half a smoked trout sandwich that was awesomeness smashed between two burnt pieces of bread. if they bread wasnt so burnt by the fool who grilled it the sandwich would have been much more satisfying as i do not enjoy eating charred carbon that causes GI cancer.we also got the bell pepper soup which was cold, and refreshing.the almond croissant was alright, not too heavy with mild almond flavors, the plain croissant was also nothing extra-specialthe couscous salad was rather interesting and something i would recommend trying, as it was fresh and the feta cheese and gave it a sharp edge like ow !only problem i had with this place was that its quite expensive for what you get. all i ordered above, if i were to eat myself id still be hungry.
The food here lived up to the hype. Great neighborhood vibe.  Walkup and order and then they serve you.  Not a place for dinner but any other time the place would be great.  Good music going also.  Highly recommend it as a stop.
Came here for breakfast at the recommendation of our hotel concierge, and can't say I was disappointed. The service was great, even in the morning rush. Our server even took the time to chat with my friends and I to recommend places to see during our  weekend in Montreal. I absolutely fell in love with the apricot coconut & white chocolate brioche. The place itself was comfortable and rustic - felt like we were in  France. Would definitely go back again!
Extremely popular lunch spot; but didn't quite get the hype aside from the excellent pastries and lattes (this is where the 3 stars comes from).  Went here for an espresso and a chocolate brioche, both of which were awesome but then came for lunch and had the Cuban sandwich....not so awesome.  It was just really greasy with a little meat and cheese and the other sandwiches looked so much better.  The ginger tea was excellent though, and the salads looked pretty good.  It's also really pricey -- $35 for 2 sandwiches and 2 teas.  Next time I will pass on this place for lunch (or the Cuban at least) and only go here for the pastries and espresso.
Simply divine!  Picturesque flower pots open window seat looking out to Old Montreal on Rue St. Paul made it five star highlight.  The entire menu delights me!  By far my favorite breakfast/brunch hot spot in Old Montreal!
The sweet stuff is less sweet than the ones in America, which is a huge plus. Latte was meh. Atmosphere was good. Would come again.
Brilliant place. We visited twice during our long weekend in Montreal and enjoyed this bakery/cafe. Try the delicious house-made fontina cheese plate and the basic green salad (which is anything but basic)
Why is it so hard to get a good espresso and croissant sometimes?  I'm so glad that I found this place because they fill that void.  I'm not going to lie - this place is packed so  you'll have to take that into consideration.  The staff has a bizarre system that seems to keep things moving along and their friendly attitude makes it work.  Everyone was super nice and the coffee was so rich and wonderful.  The baked good were heaven - brioche, croissants, muffins... and the egg sandwich is so flavorful.  This place is filled with character and is a wonderful experience.  Please note that they are closed on Sundays :(
While there were many good reviews, I found my experience to be lacking, if not slightly comical.  For me the confusion lied with the line to pay the bill. This line consisted of people buying food from the bakery and people waiting to pay for their meals. There were two women taking money, one was the cashier and the other presumably baking and dealing with payment at the same time. The people in front of me were being helped by one cashier so I moved to the next one. This is where the stereotypical French/English Canadian culture clash began. The malevolent little baker yelled at me to get to the end of the line. A little confused I returned to my spot in line. She then yelled at me a second time, 'sir these men have paid!', pointing at the men behind me in line. 'They've paid?' I repeated, totally confused. 'Yes, they paid!' She yelled, clearly losing any patience she had with an ignorant line cutting anglophone. I looked at the man behind me who was as confused as I was. I looked at her with what I can only assume was a stupid look on my face and said 'sooo...'. She mockingly made a stupid face back at me and just stared at me. It began to dawn on me that she meant that the men had YET to pay. The man behind me told her that I had been in front of him the whole time. To which she responded that I could stay in line if the man behind me said it was alright. For some odd reason I felt the urge to apologize to the man behind me. He laughed and said her behaviour was unbelievable. I finally was afforded the privilege to pay her and she threw the change in to my hand without looking at me. I exited onto the street somewhat baffled and embarrassed. The food was good if not a little pricey, but not good enough to be treated in such a manner.
Olive et Gourmando, how do I love thee... I've been a patron of Oilive et Gourmando (in the sense of literally having spent thousands of dollarinos there!) for over three years now. I 'm a regular, so it's hard for me to write a totally unbiased review. If you don't know O&G, it's unique among breakfast/lunch cafés in Montreal. The atmosphere reminds one of a New York or LA hipster café, but unlike the latter, O&G is not pretentious in the least, and everyone is treated in a totally egalitarian way no matter who you are and how often you come here. I hate places with attitude about how cool they are, and how lucky you are to be hanging out there. There's none of that BS at O&G, and it is cool without trying. It's first come first serve, and you'll wait at least 20-30 minutes for a table between Noon and 1. If you can't stand the wait, head straight past the line of folks waiting up front, and continue straight back to the glass vitrines, where you can order to go. The great thing about O&G is they make their own everything, and they only make just enough for each day, so you're guaranteed things will be fresh. The soups are usually great, although having eaten so many of them I notice that the flavor profiles tend to be repeated; they are usually spicy with a good bit of acidity. My main critique of O&G, that the flavors can be a bit one-note, is also praise, because they do things with incredible consistency and high-standards. The salads are better than anywhere else I've tried in town, and you won't find any mushy or blackened leaves here. Try the Caesar salad con pollo, which is a great mix of bacon, capers, and parmesan with romaine and kale. Also a classic is the No. 24, a good vegan noodle salad. For sandwiches, the spicy cajun chicken with its great blend of mango and guacamole is "nummers". Another favorite, especially in winter, is the Cubain, with its decadent hot, cheesy, meaty goodness. The pastries are all exceedingly rich, and at times too heavy for my palate, but the brownie and the Belgian chocolate pecan cookie are great and will put you in chocolate / butter overload territory. The brioche is way too heavy though. Coffee is very good here too, and they have a nice tea selection. All in all, O&G is a great place to have lunch and / or spend a morning in a buzzing yet cozy place with excellent, friendly service, and attention to detail.
I have two words for you.  The Cubain!!  Do not eat this if you're worried about calories.  Don't be worried about calories and EAT IT!!  This place is busy at lunch so get there early or get take out.  Do you like cookies?  You'll love the cookies here too.  They're huge so good for sharing and once again worth the calories.  We also ordered their salad of the day which was also very tasty.
Oh Montreal!   This is one of the reasons why I love you... The BEST place for grab lunch in the BEST area of town.  There's always a wait here, but the line moves rather quickly, so WAIT!  Their panini's are amazing, especially the caramelized onions with goat cheese!  Show up rather early, because they tend to sell out of panini's towards the end of the day.  Also, before leaving, you MUST get the "extraordinary brownie", and also take one to go for the road home.  Honestly, the BEST brownies I've ever had in my life, and my sweet tooth is ginormous!  It has a hint of espresso in it which complements the bitterness of the valrhona chocolate.  And since you're ordering up the brownie, may as well get the chocolate-banana brioche too!  I'm from Boston, and everytime I visit, I stock up on their pastries like it was the end of the world.  I am considering just calling them up and having them ship to me their goodies... worth every shipping penny.
croissants were perfect,  delicious sandwiches,  really sparse menu,  had the Cuban and wife had the cajun chicken. great location,  hip,  quirky,  very pleasant service.
The croissants and pastries are amazing. I was there around 9:30 on a weekday morning and the plain croissants were already sold-out. Hence, I ended up trying an almond croissant. It was absolutely divine. By the time we finished eating, even the filled croissants were sold-out. It's like a taste of Europe right in the heart of Old Montreal. All of their breads and pastries are very high quality and very European. I wish there was a place like this in every city.I would definitely go out of my way to go there again on my next trip to Montreal.
The food here is outstanding and the coffee is pretty good, too. I would have given it 5 stars except it is pretty expensive, even for the quality. When back in Montreal, I would go again, though once per trip is the splurge limit. The brioche is quite good. We also had a fruit cup which was good, though way too much. Between my husband and me, we ordered two brioche and one fruit cup, which was too much for the two of us (and my husband has a pretty good appetite). The coffees are good but order the large size. It is about twice as much as the petite for just slightly more money. Fresh orange juice was a nice treat.The only downside is the cost - 2 lattes, 2 OJ, 2 brioche, and 1 fruit cup came to over $50.
Absolutely AMAZING bakery!!! Oh how I wished I was able to squeeze in a 2nd trip here. They have the most amazing croissants... pain du chocolat. I credit myself on being able to spot good food when I see one and ordered the most amazing bread/ pastry that I saw in the display. OMG. DROOL!!! Hands down all time favorite bakery IN THE WORLD!We had a cuppa hot chocolate along with the breakfast... OOH SOO GOOD!
Best lunch EVER! The grilled goat cheese and cartelized onion sandwich and roasted beet salad with nuts and watercress were to die for! Again, best lunch ever!
Very cool place.  It would do well in SF.  Very diverse menu with fresh ingredients. . . soups and salads.  Excellent Goat Cheese panini.  Listened to the guy who wrote 36 hours in Montreal and he was spot on.
Good fresh and interesting sandwiches (trout was very good), salads, soups.  In a comfortable cafe.  I'd definitely go back even if I hadn't tried the sea salt turtle bar which earned a star on its own.
What can I say, I found this place on Yelp and had to try it myself.  The previous reviews were dead on.  We had to wait but weren't intimated by the crowds considering the food here was supposed to be excellent.  I was disappointed that they didn't have the poached egg sandwich but the server suggested the Mac n cheese which was made from 4 cheeses and included a salad (all for $10).  It was definitely worth it, hot and tasty!  Also tried the Chicken sandwich which was very satisfying.  They have a very nice ambiance, slightly loud music but good songs. Closed on Sundays and Mondays so make your way here on weekdays or Saturday mornings.
very good bakery and sandwiches, very nice place. service was ok.
I don't often give five stars, but can't recommend this place enough!  Their egg-cheese-bacon sandwich was out of this world, and the croissants were to die for.  I lived in Paris for 5 years, and can tell you these croissants were as good as they come.  Nice little cafe, wish they had been open Sunday too!
While this looks like a total tourist trap (with tourists overflowing onto the sidewalk), it also had a lot of locals.  It was worth the wait and provided a super yummy, filling lunch.  All of their salads looked great, and my friend loved her's and the soup (and she's QUITE picky).  I had the goat cheese with caramelized onions.  Bought a couple of pastry to have for breakfast the next day.  How to order/pay was a bit confusing, but other than that it was a very satisfying experience!
what a perfect little place.  I wish we had more places like this here in Miami.  All you need to know is that everything is exceedingly fresh and the sandwiches are the best I had in Montreal.  The atmosphere is very cute with great energy.  Highly recommended for an excellent lunch.  We were there for 6 days and came here twice.
amazing paninis.amazing homemade lemonade.amazing atmosphere.really good place for brunch.and who can beat the lovely euro feel of old montreal?
Some mighty fine pastries and croissants with the combination of good italian coffee while located at the heart of old Montreal, makes this place a true gem!
Awesome sandwiches and pastries.
I have been here now for lunch twice, and I am always grateful to make the trek to Old Montreal.  The space is great, the coffee/hot cocoa/tea are amazing, and I love their sandwiches. I got the Herbivore salad last time, and it was also great.  Plus their desserts are quite nice.  It is super busy, so expect to wait, but the service is friendly considering.
Best Ricotta of my life.
Wonderful!  As another reviewer mentioned - try the almond croissant.
You will never find a better mocha. Ever. Nice place for celebrity spotting too in the summer.
My visit to this cafe made my summer trip to Montreal complete. I couldn't stop going back the atmosphere was so soft and lighthearted yet perfect service, the floor mgr was funny cool and sweet.... I love the breakfast menu... try everything its so worth going here if your anywhere close to old town Montreal
Cute little spot in the Old Port. Absolutely lovely, very European with tons of french pastries and good coffee. I would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Montreal or even to locals.
ttempted to eat here on Thursday, July 21 at around 1 pm.  All tables were full with nobody waiting.  We were told by the hostess (tall, slightly curly short black hair; medium plus build) that we would have to wait around 10 minutes and that we were next.  After approximately 5 minutes, a couple walked in and were greeted warmly by the hostess in french (we speak only english) and were immediately given a table.  When the hostess returned, we asked her why they were seated before us if we were next.  She stated that they were waiting before us.  They were not.  She was extremely brusque and aggressive in her response.  The attitude was overflowing.  This led us to a few possible conclusions:1.  she knew them personally, 2.  they were given preferential treatment because they spoke french,3.  the restaurant has become drunk with success and no longer feel that civil customer service is part of their business model.It seems a shame, given the food looked pretty good.
Good food nice ambiance but a little pricey for what it is
Nice sandwiches and salad. Lot of people on summer days at lunch time.
I ordered and paid for 3 sandwiches and bakery items to go.  When I came back to my place, I found they had put only one of the 3 sandwiches in the bag.  I know I should have checked but they should have made sure to get the order right.  I'd expect this at McDonald's drive through, but not where they charge so much per sandwich.
Artsy place with a cool vibe. My wife and I went there for a nice lunch and that is exactly what we got.  I really like the contrast of flavors that we had in our sandwiches. Mango, cajun chicken, and avocado --MMM!! Delicous!
One can't help but pine for the culinary comfort of a Parisienne cafe when walking the cobblestone streets of Old Montreal. When in search of a place to have breakfast we happened upon this place which had quite a line at 10 am on a friday. Stupidly we opted to go to a place across the street that was fairly empty called Marche de la Vilette which ended up being a failure. Angry we went back across the street just to check out the menu and I ended up getting a sensual chocolate banana brioche bun. The butter caused see thru grease stains in the takeaway paper bag but I didn't come to Monteal for salad and granola... We still wanted to try the true "petite dejeuner" and hit up Olive et Gourmando the day after. We had the egg salad hot panini which was a damned revelation. The cafe au lait was great too. Reading the paper in the sunlight that teased its way to our table and dining on a complex panini of eggs, sriracha, oven roasted tomatoes and cheese was one of the fondest memories of our trip.
This corner café in Old Montreal is seriously one of the best in the entire city. The food and pastries are absolutely second to none. Everything I have had here has been incredibly creative, fresh, and tasty. The atmosphere is also truly charming. I love their Franglais plays on words written on their chalkboard walls; the charming old seating and the windows filled with plants that open onto the cobbled streets and three-hundred year old buildings. It would be improved if they added a row of street seating (were it legal) for those beautiful summer days. And it is insanely crowded - at 3 PM on a Wednesday, no less. I am not sure if there is ever a time you will feel relaxed here...but that's what you get when you offer the best food in the best surroundings in a neighborhood somewhat surprisingly lacking in other quality offerings. If you are going to Old Montreal, make this your morning or afternoon repose, bar none.
Honestly folks get a grip.  The sandwiches are good but not extraordinary and not worth going out of your way for.  It gets a zero for ambiance.  All the guide books talked this place up but we just didn't get it.
We went to Olive & Gourmando for lunch. It was a popular local eatery with a very long line. Some students brought a book to read while waiting. The menu was hand-written on the wall in French, which we knew very little. We ordered the food based on our limited understanding and a lot of guessing. We were starved after the long waiting and did not know whether we ordered the food we anticipated. Luckily, the sandwiches were delicious. I will definitely bring a travel dictionary next time.
I grabbed food here on the way to the airport after a meeting in Montreal a couple of years ago.  It was pricey, but service was fast and the food was unbeatable.  My only "complaint" is that, like so many other places in Montreal, everybody switches effortlessly between French and English and makes me feel lame for only knowing one language.
The sandwiches are to die for. Ingredients that you wouldn't normally think mix well are like symphonies of flavour in your mouth. Get there earlier in the day because they run out of sandwiches and there are less choices to pick from.
So this place was packed when we got here, so we opted just to get a pastry to go.  We had the chaussons aux pommes, mmmm good.  The apple was a little tart and not too sweet.  The pastry shell itself was delicious, sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar.  We wish we were able to fully enjoy what this place had to offer after having the pastry we wanted more! Definitely worth checking out!
i'm not sure if it was a time of year when the city empties out, but walking around montreal i noticed that there were so many restaurants that were absolutely empty or outright closed. to my surprise olive was packed and we actually had to wait a bit to be seated. rather than being annoyed, i knew we were in for a good lunch. i wasn't disappointed. the cuban sandwich was excellent and really hit the spot. the bread was perfectly crispy and the cheese was pure melted goodness.   the vanilla strawberry lemonade was surprisingly refreshing and the latte kept me happy as we walked along artist alley on a chilly day.
Best almond croissant ever.  Unfortunately, it was crowded and we didn't want to ruin our dinner reservation, so we stopped in for a snack of some pastries.  The almond croissant was unforgettable.  We also ordered the raisin and walnut brioche and it was fantastic.  Only down side is they're not open on Sunday or we'd bring some home.
love love LOVE this place.  i don't know if its b/c the tomatoes are so fresh - again something we realized after visiting montreal - the tomatoes are so fresh and good.  like crack - addicting!  i love it so much i want to give it 5 stars and wanted to go back for dinner and the next day for breakfast/brunch.  it is in a completely cute area of old town montreal and has the cutest vibe.  entering the restaurant, you wait in line until someone comes up to you and asks for your name and # in party.  you wait and then get seated at a table.  you then order your food at the counter, give them the paper that the host/hostess gave to you and wait for your food to arrive.  how they know where you are sitting to deliver your food - i still don't know.  i don't remember them giving you a table number.  it has such a cool vibe, ambiance.  very casual with a mix of couples, singles, and families.  service was good and everyone was very friendly.  we ordered the tomato/mozzarella salad, cream of broccoli soup, and a side salad.  all were phenomenal!  the tomato/mozzarella salad had the perfect mix of ingredients.  there were some crunchy crouton type of fixings along with some roasted tomato/olive salsa.  the cream of broccoli was more like a broccolli puree and was not that fatty/creamy.  we also ordered almond croissants to go (as recommended by other yelpers) and a palmier.  we had the croissants the following morning on the plane and they were still completely tasty!  i cannot wait to go back to olive et gourmando...i would love to eat breakfast here every day if i could.
Holy asdfghjkl.What is this heaven that I've found on earth?I am a chicken lover. J'adore le poulet!! And an even greater fries lover. And this place does not kid about their fries. If there's one thing that can earn my respect for an eatery (obviously besides good food), it's massive portions. They stuff that poor styrofoam box with so much fries ohhhhhh mannnnnn. So delicious. AND free Portuguese bread-- not sure what the proper term is but it's fantastic.I was heart broken when I found out that there wasn't a Nando's here but brahh, this is arguably better.I think they only take debit/cash which doesn't really affect me so 5 freaking stars for you Glen Coco.
About a 2-2.5: Romados is a Portuguese bakery and grilled chicken place that is considered to offer one of the best grilled chicken in the city of Montreal.  The menu offers different parts of the chicken as family packs or as combos, coming with a bed of rice, fries, a side of salad, as well as a large bread.  You can opt for the chicken to be 'spicy' or 'regular,' which is a brushing of a sauce.  The hubs and I shared a 1/4 white-meat chicken combo, which came with a breast and thigh.  I was slightly disappointed, as the chicken itself didn't look like how many had described it to be, with the skin being nice and crisp.  It was definitely juicy, but it was lacking in the flavors, as even the 'sauce' didn't help much.  I'm sure you could request for some extra sauce on the side or some extra brushing, but I wasn't much of a fan of the sauce any way.  The bread, I didn't care for, as it was pretty dry.  Service was super friendly, and there's limited seats within.  Just note that there are 2 lines - one for walk-ins (on the left), and one for call-aheads (on the right). +friendly staff+complimentary bread with meal+juicy chicken, but still flavorless (?)
Romados? Romados!!! How have I not reviewed Romados yet? This is a Portuguese chicken Makkah for BBQ lovers from all over town and the world!  There is always, always, always a line. The first time I went there I looked at the line and kept on walking, but then I passed by the window to the kitchen, took one look at the rotisserie and went back to the line... I was not disappointed, and I keep coming back again and again.  There is a line for spontaneous people, and a line for people who pre-order on the phone, but most people just don't do that.  However, don't worry, the line moves steadily, and sure enough, you'll get there - and get to ask the servers for what you desire. They have all kinds of combos - 1/4, 1/2 or whole chicken with fries / rice and salad.  Sometimes they will make you choose between rice and fries and other times they will give some of both, depending on the server's mood. When they are in really good mood, you will get extra pices of chicken as well (happened to me once!). The portion size is huge though, and I was never able to finish. I always have leftovers for the next day.  Other times I just come in to get a whole chicken to take home, and that keeps me going for a few days! They also have sandwiches, but the Bifana (pork sandwich) is not nearly as good as the chicken.The quality of the chicken is consistently superb. It's super tasty and I personally prefer the spicy sauce. The down side to this place, other than the line, is that the servers just throw the food in Styrofoam boxes, and their way of chucking lots of everything in there unfortunately extends to the the salad dressing as well... the box is always overstuffed with goodness, but it's more of a take out thing, and for those who want to sit down and eat there, it's kind of a bummer to be eating out of Styrofoam... (no plates! or non plastic cutlery).While their prices are very reasonable, sometimes you can get coupons that will make it even cheaper!
Mmm chicken. Said to be an institution in the heart of Montreal's historically Portuguese neighborhood, the menu of the day featured both chicken soup and BBQ Salmon. Both options made my mouth water but seeing the dozen or so BBQ chickens in the background grilling, not to mention the aromas of chicken from block away, I really couldn't bring myself to try the fish.Ordering:This is not a traditional sit down restaurant. To the right are pastries and bread you can order at an walk up counter. To the left are some tables to eat at should you decide to eat on site. And down the middle are two line ups, one for preorder pick up and one for ordering.My girlfriend and I opted for a large chicken poutine to share along with a chicken soup and a traditional Portuguese dessert, pastel de nata.The food:First - A large chicken poutine: It's literally assembled in front of you. The staff took our order and grabbed two chicken thighs from the grill, stripped the meat off the bones and packed it into a Styrofoam box - I dock of points for Styrofoam  - with gravy, cheese and fries. There was so much food; between us we could have easily shared a small.  The chicken was so delicious - moist bbq chicken cooked and flavoured perfectly -  though with the fries, gravy and cheese it was salty for my taste.Second - the soup was also generous in proportion.  I can see myself needing/wanting/craving it on a cold day or if I had the flu. The chicken melted in my mouth, but the noodles were soggy.Lastly - among the wide choice of pasties, the pastel de nata is definitely the way to go. It was a nice way to end the meal, not too sweet, the pastry flaked off nicely and it's making my mouth water now thinking about it.Overall - the value for money is unbeatable. It's totally possible to have dinner with leftover for lunch the next day on ten bucks per person.
I've had Portuguese good and really good one at that back in NYC. I was in Montreal for 3 days and I haven't found a place to eat to get me on that bus on a full stomach. I picked this place because it was the one of the top recommended 10 eateries to try. I travelled here from old Montreal to try the found. I backtracked on the poutine because just by looking at it, the fries seemed a bid tender with oil. I ordered the 1/4 chicken with frites. Now my issue is that my starving stomach awaited a travel and wait of 20 min to get this. The chicken was ok, but it did mix good with the spicy sauce try have. But honestly this place is overhyped, not the Portuguese type food you'd expect. More like the fast food version. Fyi you get a free roll of bread from the bakery inside.
Wow get your rotisserie on here! This spot is very popular so order to go or come off hours as there's only 5-6 tables.  Be sure to order as much as you can to avoid wishing you had more. I got a 1/2 spicy chicken combo covered in fries and small side salad for about $9.Whatever that sauce is I've got to get my hands on it! It's spicy sweet barbecuey sauce that got me feenin.
Worth the hype; Ramados offers authentic Portuguese style rotisserie chicken with addictive sauces and good service. The chicken is butterflied and chopped into finger food sized pieces. The skin is very crispy and beautifully seasoned. Order ahead to avoid lines. However,  we showed up to a lineup that stretched to the door and did not have to wait long as the staff bagged chicken after chicken with surprising speed. If you're hungry; get the whole chicken for two. Fries are also delicious from here. The salad is nothing to rave about but then again this place is not about eating salad. Staff is friendly and efficient.
After watching Anthony Bourdain's Layover episode on Montreal, we found our way to Romados and were not disappointed. This place is seriously good. Huge portions at a very reasonable price makes this place a must visit while you're in Montreal.
Often imitated rarely (but many places are trying) duplicated. Romados is the benchmark for Portuguese chicken and fries in Montreal. It's been a while since I've eaten here and can't believe I haven't reviewed it but here we go. Came here with out of town friends on a Friday night to explain this joint is a staple in Montreal dining. We arrived at near 8PM and the line was almost out the door. I explained to my friends the wait was well worth it. 20 minutes later we were eating delicious tender succulent charcoal grilled chicken. The flavour is really out of this world. The mix of the spicy sauce and grilled flavour is 7th heaven. The fries are light and heaping in serving. Also provided was a small salad. My friends had to try the chicken poutine and it came as a massive serving with a heap of chopped chicken. Words that come to my mind about Romados: sublime, delicious, light, flavourful, spice, seasoned, fall off the bone tender, huge portions, tasty awesome and inexpensive! If you don't eat here you are missing out on one of Montreal's finest dining experiences!
If you are in the area and hungry, there is no better option than to order a quarter chicken and fries and Ramados. Montreal is home to some of the best Portuguese rotisserie restaurants, but none offering charcoal-fired chicken at affordable prices like Ramados. The combos are packed with generous servings of chicken, fries, and salad, so there are no worries of leaving unsatisfied. Don't forget to order some natas to finish your meal! Ramados is a take-out restaurant, but there are two or three tables inside. However, there is no better place to enjoy your saucy, charred chicken than the nearby park on a sunny afternoon!
I first went to Romados two summers ago and I have been craving it ever since.  The service is very quick and the staff is VERY polite and friendly- you feel like you've been friends with them for years.  As for the food- I LOVE chicken and this is some of the best chicken you can find anywhere in Montreal.  The prices are unbelievable with the most expensive menu item being a large side portion of rice for $13.50.  We got the meal combos that included the 1/2 chicken, fries, salad and rice and it was under $10!!  You can decide if you want the chicken to be spicy or not too.  I got it spicy and it was the perfect amount of added heat to add a real kick to the meal. We then walked down the street and enjoyed our meal at the small park that is close by.  It was perfect and I can't wait to go back.
Really great Portuguese chicken, fries are soooo yummy and the natas are the best in town! Best to call ahead and put in your order as the line ups are nuts at peak times. Also you'll get better service if you speak French...just sayin'
Another place that ppl are crazy about but it's always crowded and the "spice" is more just salt.I would recommend, the next time you feel for this, turn left off St-Laurent on to Rachel instead of right and go one block you will fine a much smaller little shop (Rotisserie Portugalia) turning out the same if not better tasting Portuguese chicken.Just my 2cents
I don't quite understand the hype Ramados receives. The wait is always very long and I've been disappointed with the food.The chicken cooked in charcoal has a nice flavour. It would be so much better if they basted it while cooking instead of drowning it in piri piri sauce after cooking. I find the skin often comes out soggy. Their fries are well seasoned but frequently undercooked. When all you serve is fries and chicken, you have to deliver it to perfection every time.There are so many choices for Portuguese chicken in Montreal, it's a question of taste but Ramados is far from toping this list in my book.
Arriving at a good time, the lineup behind me got massive!   We only had 4-5 parties in front of us, and the line moved quickly.The chicken is divine.   It is cooked on a rotisserie with a dry rub, and you can add a spicy sauce to it - which wasn't spicy at all, but very tasty.  They toss the chicken bits into a bag, and off you go.   There is minimal seating inside so plan to eat elsewhere - there is a nearby park with picnic tables we found.   Service is quick, and this place is popular for a reason - great chicken.
If you're visiting Montreal like the wife and I and trying to find this place, just walk down Rue Rachel and let that wonderful sweet smoke guide your senses.  That delicious smell wafting through the air will lead you to some tasty Portuguese comfort food. Plain and simply . . . Just order the chicken plate!  You can order it with a 1/4, 1/2 or full chicken. It comes with a crispy on the outside, tender on the inside rotisserie chicken slathered with a spicy, citrusy Portuguese barbecue sauce that'll make you say, "Thank Goodness we came here after that 2 hour hike through Parc du Mt Royal!"  A salad, rice and some of the best seasoned fries I've tasted is literally piled high on your plate.  I'm glad the wife and I shared a plate because I had just enough room for that Portuguese egg tart and coconut flan.  The egg tart was flaky, chewy and creamy all at the same time.  And if you like flan, just imagine flan with a little coconut rum like twist . . . Miam!Excellent food . . . Happy wallet!
Hot restaurant served hot food but cold tart.... It seemed to be lined up all the time because the price was very reasonable for such large portion of chicken. I had 1/4 chicken with half rice and half fries(Thank the friendly staff for meeting my requirements :) . But honestly, I expected to taste much flavourful chicken not just salty. Even all the side dishes, salad, rice and fries are better than chicken. The bread was good but the tart was not crisp at all!! The cold stuffing was too sweet. So, I only can give it 3 stars.
This place is a Montreal classic. My husband is from Portugal and trust me when I say they have the best pastéis de nata in the city. Best Portuguese chicken! Can't go wrong with anything in this place
One of my absolute pet peeves is going to a restaurant and being served dry chicken. Fortunately, this is not the case!This used to be one of my favorite places to grab lunch in Montreal. The chicken is very juicy and tender. It is seasoned perfectly with tons of flavor from each bite. Everything is fairly priced and the portions they give are reasonable. Definitely a great place, unfortunately it is a bit far and inconvenient to go.Very satisfied and highly recommended!
Yum yum yum! I am remembering the chicken and fries right now and I just want to salivate! We came here based on Anthony Bourdain's visit and I was determined to try. So tender, so flavorful! The chicken and fries were fully drenched with that "crack sauce." When I say crack sauce, I mean it is so addicting you don't want to stop eating. I don't recall the exact price of the meal but I shared with my boyfriend and it was more than enough food! There was a long line but it moved quickly and especially so when you know what you order. The seating is really small but you can easily take it to go at a nearby parks (seems to be parks are a plenty in Montreal). Luckily we found a table and chowed down! There isn't much space but you begin to forget about it once you eat. It is definitely chicken and fries to try and I can see myself coming here again!
The half-chicken is an amazing deal! Comes with fries and salad, and the chicken itself is very well seasoned and full of flavor. The seating space is a little bit limited though, and the pastry section's desserts seemed not very fresh. Altogether, a great experience because the chicken was top notch. I will definitely revisit this place, but I suggest to avoid the desserts section in the evening.
This was the best meal I had in Montreal. I ate at Joe Beef, and all the top restaurants in old town and Rotissire Romados kicked them all to the curb. 1/2 chicken with spicy sauce, fresh fries, and salad... all for under $10? You seriously can't beat that. The chicken juices and hot sauce seep into the fries if you let it sit for a few minutes. Take yours to-go, walk down to La Fontaine Park and enjoy the best chicken while sitting on the grass. I wish we had a restaurant like this in San Francisco!
The first time I try to eat here. The chicken is plain not taste marinade or hot sauce . To much oily.  The price is very good. The place to seat is very tight
Super moist chicken, and great desserts! Protip - dont take pics of their chicken behind in the kitchen i was yelled at in french by a very angry lady. We ordered half a chicken and sides to share with some friends. The spicy sauce was really tasty but not quite spicy so hot food friends might be disappointed. I'd come here as a regular for sure if I lived nearby!
This is yet another establishment which makes Montreal Montreal. Nothing fancy, no gimmicks, no attitude and amazing prices. Just roasted Portuguese chicken, fries, sauce, salad and a bread and Portuguese and French pastry counter.There is absolutely nothing more that I can add except to say that if you are visiting Montreal or a naive Montrealer who has never gone then GO. Like NOW.Chicken roasted to perfection, juicy and yet still practically falling off the bone. So good that you're going to use your hand to get right into the bone as well.And then the fries. These are perfect salt and pepper fries, which reminded me of the salt and pepper chips which the Kettle brand makes. Try to get them slathered with the spicy sauce and it's a joygasm in your mouth. They also sell homemade Portuguese sausages, buns and of course natas, their sweet egg custard cups which are probably the best in the city.For $13 bucks for a whole chicken, it's worth your while to pick up a bird or two, a large order of fries and take them home, keep them in glass containers to keep them fresh, and you have a great lunch meal to take to work for a couple of days.While you're waiting in line, it's an interesting place to people watch. Everybody seems to come here, I saw Portuguese aunties, guys from the hip hop crowd, snotty Westmount chicks waiting in the Land Rovers outside, professionals coming from work and everyone in between. That's the thing about great food; it brings everyone together.
Restaurant staff were extremely helpful and friendly, but food was not that great. Chicken was dry and Portuguese tart was cold and overly sweet. Fries were nice and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, but were extremely salty. Rice was bland, but salad and dressing were ok. Food did not live up to the hype on this visit.
First and only time i've had portuguese chicken and I was not dissapointed. The chicken was very flavourful and juicy. You get a huge box of fries and chicken for about 10$. Would visit every time i'm in the neighborhood.
My second time eating here and this time I tried their poutine, the chicken and the poutine were delicious! My friends fell in love with this place and it was their first time eating poutine and they screamed out more poutine on our way back to New Haven! Craving for more delicious chicken & poutine from this place!!!Be aware they do not take credit card. Cash or Debit only!
So I have nothing to say against the food. The chicken is always super tasty and well cooked. My chicken sandwich was excellent and my salad was good. The only thing is I wish they put a bit more love in their service. I mean the lady literally throw a huge handful of salad in my styrofoam box, add way too much dressing and force the cover to close. So I'm walking with salad hanging out my box and dressing dripping all over...not the end of the world but I like love served with my food. That's all.
This place is great. Food is excellent and I love taking take out and walking to the mountain to have a picnic in the parc.
Best Portuguese chicken in all of Montreal. Almost no waiting even in busy hours, as a tourist in Montreal I was sooo happy to find this local jewel.
Love the chicken and desserts. Fries as well! But always busy the place so recommend to go.
Well, nothing's perfect. On the one hand, the food here is consistently delicious and cheap; the kind of feel-good food you treat yourself to on a weekend or a busy weeknight. You've seen the reviews.On the other hand, ordering from here is a huge pain. Ordering in advance serves no real purpose (I've ended up waiting longer than the walk-ins every time) and the line system is confusing and poorly laid out. For instance, there's a reason every fast food place ever has you order and pay at the start : it avoids the type of checkout bottleneck that is at this point a staple of Romados. Another annoyance is the two side-by-side order lines with no divider; a solution that would be much more elegant and effective than 3 different signs above and below customers' line of sight (cue arguments with other patrons). And another: no credit card and no paywave payments make payment unnecessarily slow every time. I could go on.But when all is said and done, the chicken is so good that I still end up braving the crowds and coming here nearly once a week. Problem is, Romados' management knows it, too.
Though I put 3 stars here, I think 3.5 would be more appropriate. The chicken was tender and tasty, but it wasn't the the most special chicken rotisserie ever. Like it was good, solid, satisfying, delicious, but I'm not sure that another perhaps more obscure restaurant couldn't do the same? Fries were very good, though again not necessarily exceptional? Overall still a solid experience. Portion is very generous so order less or you'll have a ton of leftovers. I think for one person 1/4 chicken is fine, and you can ask for less fries/rice and more salad.
//Vibe|Wait\\Although in a hipster area, this place isn't hipster at all. Has that classic neighborhood bakery look/feel. There are two lines, if you're only ordering bread/pastries/stuff from the freezer, get on the bakery side. Chicken is the left side.Rotisserie doesn't start until 11 am. So if you show up early and there's no line, that's because only the bakery is open. Once lunch time rolls around, no matter what day of the week, there is a wait. We queued up at 11:30 and even though the line wasn't out the door, we still waited maybe more than 30 mins. So if you live in the area, call ahead. Limited seating, but when we went, not many people were sitting to eat, so you might find an open table during lunch time so long as your group is small.//Food\\Very reasonable prices, generous portions of fries (short, thick cut). For the popularity and wait time, I just didn't get the hype behind the chicken. Maybe I should've gotten the spicy seasoning, because beside a strong taste of wine, the chicken didn't taste that special to me. It's not bad, but not a taste I'd wait so long in line for. The seasoning on the fries are good, but a little too sweet for me. You get a lot of fries for what you order, so think twice before placing a separate order or even going for the medium or large fries.I really liked the egg tarts.The crust itself was thick, chewy, layered, and flavorful. A good pastry base, which isn't always present in most egg tarts. Although the custard was much too sweet for me (with a smooth and non-curdled consistency), I was pretty impressed by the crust, and my kids thought these were the best they'd ever had.
Chicken made with crack.THE FOODI have never had rotisserie that was so compelling, this is something else. The chorizo is excellent too. The fries are not bad either, and they also have a pretty amazing bakery section.THE SERVICEPretty friendly and efficient.THE ATMOSPHEREBusy, hip, bustling.
Forget all the other chicken places when in Montreal.  Romados hands down has the best chicken in the city.When you come to Romados, you will notice that they have classic Portuguese fair on the menu, bifanas, fish, etc, but I can't stress it enough, ORDER THE CHICKEN.  You won't be disappointed.  It comes with seasoned fries and a little salad.  When the person at the counter asks if you want sauce, say yes! Sauce on the chicken but also tell him or her to put on the fried.  Trust me.As you sit down and open the box, just be careful.  The fries might be overflowing.When you will bite into the perfectly cooked chicken, you won't be able to help but notice how crispy the skin is and how juicy and smokey the meat is.  It literally falls off the bone! Just make sure you lick those bones clean, I sure know I do!I don't live in Montreal anymore, but when I do come back, I make sure I make a pit stop at Romados.  Every time my friends tell me they're going to Montreal, I tell them they have to go to Romados.  They come back thanking me and telling me that it was the best chicken they have had in their lives!  YES, I'm serious!Once you're done, if you still have space left, get one of their pasteis de nata (Portuguese custard tarts).  Simply delicious.  By far the best place for Portuguese chicken, or any chicken for that matter, in Montreal.  There's a reason that there's always a line up.
Worth the wait, plus the line moves quickly. Sometimes the chicken isn't as juicy as I remember, so always get extra sauce just in case!
Such a massive!! amount of food for such a reasonable price. The chicken is really done to perfection. This place is a stable in the area and for good reason
I live in the US now and this is one of the places I always go back to when I visit family. Best BBQ chicken I've ever had, no doubt about it.
Their portions are HUGE! For under $10 you get a 1/2 chicken, salad, rice, french fries and a dinner roll. I could easily eat this for 2 maybe 3 meals. The chicken is quite delicious, very tender and juicy. The french fries are yummy and I don't know how they make their rice but there seems to be some seasoning infused in it which makes it quite yummy too! I had wanted to try their portuguese tarts too when I first went in but I was too stuffed by the end! It's usually pretty busy but the line goes pretty fast. The space is okay, the seating is a bit close to one another and can feel a bit cramped and sometimes all the seating it taken, but the food is totally worth it!
Good price value. Everything on the menu is pretty good, but they are competing with a lot of good Portuguese places in the area. The service could be a bit more friendly.
Love the Portuguese chicken, fries could be a bit crispier on the edges. Good natas for dessert.
Not the nicest decor. No place (almost) to sit but the best chicken I had, punto. Read the reviews and all but nothing better than give it a try. I highly recommend it and I will go back for sure.
We stopped by here on our way to the park, and as usual, there was a pretty long lineup. Fortunately, the lineup moves pretty quickly. Overall the food was pretty good, especially the fries, and the prices are great - $10 for a meal. That being stated, we weren't happy with the portion size of the chicken breast - just too small. Also, maybe we were unlucky, but the chicken was a touch dry. I've been to other Portuguese rotisseries that I thought were better, but I would still come back here if in the area.
Top notch Portugese chicken perfect for a picnic at nearby Parc Jeanne-Mance! The 1/4 chicken combo (with fries and salad) is my go-to. Portions are very large--for a meal under $10, it's really great bang for your buck.
What can I say about this place other than it's the go to place for Portuguese chicken in Montreal.  It's been around for a while and locals and tourists alike love this place.  The service is pretty much cafeteria style and there is a seating area, but it's very small.  The line ups are fairly long and this place is busy until they close up in the evenings.  I suggest coming here grabbing take out and eating in the nearby park or on the hood of your car if you want to enjoy this chicken action.They give you a massive amount of food with each order.  You get your choice of chicken quarter or half, a ton of fries, a salad and a bun as well.  You can also choose to get hot sauce on the side or drizzled all over your chicken if you like.  I suggest on the side, as the chicken has plenty of flavour as it is.Overall a great spot to grab that Portuguese chicken you've been craving in the Montreal area.  The price is right and the chicken is juicy, what else can you ask for right?Oh yes and try their custard tarts too, so delicious!
Sorry, but i really don't get it. The chicken is greasy and the fries so-so. It's like the Portuguese-style junk food. I would not recommend it. Clean place and nice people though.
Not all that impressed here. The food is good but nothing I would come out of my way for. Eats:- whole chicken which is the only reason I would come back. It was juicy from every bite. Skin had great flavor and was cooked just right- French fries.....ehhhh it was ok but I wouldn't order it again- Salad.......just lettuce with some onions and dressing, yes I know it's a salad but I would pay $3.00 for what was given. Dislikes:- employees are not that friendly. I was a bit rushed which I don't like. I also needed to take something to go and took one of the white paper bags located on the counter and the woman behind the counter snatched the bag out of my hands and told me i can't use that bag......some advice it's a bag and if I can't use it for my "to go" things don't leave it out!!!- see top for French fries and salad- limited seating- no soap in the restroom- a little pricey I would not come back.....sorry yelp reviewers I was misled this time.
The chicken was not good!!!the meat is too dry..and the service is terrible!!!!!you delete my review?i can give you just a bad review again!!!
Stopped here from the great reviews on here and didn't regret it.  A pretty unique experience for me to be able to get the poutine (which was made with the fresh rotisserie chicken, cheese curds, and brown gravy-- And was absolutely delicious). I also got the 1/2 chicken meal, which included a salad and A LOT of fries. Everything was incredible and I would recommend this to anyone.  If you want a unique(ish) experience in Montreal, PLEASE come here (you won't regret it).
Another Montreal staple!Here's the deal: Portuguese chicken is delicious, and Romados makes some damn good Portuguese chicken.Quality/price: for around $8-$9 you'll get a styrofoam box with more chicken, fries and salad than any regular human should eat in one sitting. If you don't consider yourself a regular human though (like most of my friends), you'll find yourself more than satisfied.If you're in the mood for being reasonable (or if you're just not down with a post-meal food coma), ask to replace your fries with more salad. This is also a good low-carb/slow-carb/keto option.
Cheap price for the huge portion.I ordered 1/2 chicken with fries and salad.Chicken was so good.Fries and salad was okay, nothing special. I couldn't even finish half of those fries.Great choice if you are hungry and don't want to go spend a lot of money.
Bargain deal for a family meal for three.  One chicken combo with fries and salad, soda $28.  The line goes almost to the door which is an indication that this is a Montreal favorite.  The chicken was smoky, tender and with a mild spicy sauce.  We ate all of it.  Fries were the one disappointment - huge serving and a bit soft and oily for my taste.  they also have chorizo sausage, but most come for the chicken.They also serve pastries and cake which we didn't try, but looked good.
I love chicken any way you serve it, so when I saw this place on Yelp, I had to make it a stop on my food crawl. We came in around 9:30pm on a Saturday night and the place was pretty busy. It's order at the grill and pay at the counter type of establishment. Perfect for takeout! I ordered a 1/4 chicken meal which you have a choice of white or dark meat for a $1 difference. They only have two sauces that they slather on your chicken, mild or spicy. I highly suggest that you go with spicy. It's not incredibly spicy but it is extremely tasty! The meal comes with delicious, crispy fries (have them put a little sauce on that too), and a side salad (so you feel so bad for eating all of those fries). With a drink, my total came out to just shy of $10. Though, the amount of food I received could have fed me for 2 meals. They also have pastries and baked goods, which I wish I wasn't so full after the meal or I would've indulged. Overall, it's delicious, fast and affordable food and I'd happily eat there again.
Oh Romados, how much do I adore you so - let me count the ways:Location - Rue Rachel and Rue de Builion in the Plateau-de-Mont-Royal. Yeah, it's a 7 minute walk from the Station Mont-Royal on the Orange line, or the STM 55 (St. Laurent/St. Urbain) bus line.  You got your OPUS card, right?  Good.  Rue Rachel is also bike friendly, so Bixi over.  Service - self service counter.  Wait on the long line for your shot of chicken rotisserie goodness, we are all equals here (unless you call it in for take-away in advance, get ready for the icy stares from lesser men and women, or has the tragic distinction of being a vegetarian...in which case, I pity you).  After you are done, take your chicken-y goodness to the Parc De Mont-Royal, or sit down on the bench outside.  Francine (I think that's her name) would come out once in awhile to greet you and ask you how you are doing in French (I think she is the wife of Fernando, the owner).  Merci beaucoup madame, le poulet est superb (sorry, my middle school French from NYC never really developed beyond this point). It's good to have the wife of the great patriarch of Montreal chicken ask how you are enjoying yourself in their presence.Food - yeah, as if you need to read my reviews to know that they are good.  Look at the satisfaction ratings - it's 90% above 4 stars as of Fall 2014.  But just in case you don't pay attention, here are the facts:a) Chicken - juicy tender and flavorful with that smoky flavor, the peri-peri based spicy sauce is downright addictiveb) Fries - plentiful, crisp yet soft and savory, salty like the way it should bec) Poutine - see fries.  Now add a healthy (to the cuisine, not to your heart) amount of cheese curds, properly set up so it's not cold, and then add some very warm and spicy chicken gravy on it.  It's Poutine as it was meant to be at the good places - it's pure and well crafted.  No silliness like guacamole, no bell pepper sauce, no hot dogs, no smoked meats like the has-beens at Resto La Banquise.  Just good, crispy soft greasy salty spicy dirty mess.  Like embarrassing good sex that leaves you itchy and sweaty all over.  Yes.  It's that good.d) Sumol - I know it's not an exclusive of theirs, but shots of Sumol should be poured while enjoying their chicken.  It's citrusy, it's effervescent, it's cheap(ish), won't give you a weird buzz like Guarana, and it's not coyingly sweet like those godawful American sodas.  Just do it.e) Pasteis de nata - the quintessential Portuguese custard/egg tarts.  There's a reason why they are ALWAYS sold out by 7p.  It's soft, it's crispy, it's savory, it's better than 90% of the tart practitioners in North America (and I should know - I hit the joints in Newark often).  Just buy some, and then try the other places in Montreal (a certain stall in Marche Jean-Talon comes close, just like some of the Chinatown bakeries on Rue De La Gauchetiere, but it's just not quite the same).  You'll see WHY it's better.  Value - $9.50 for a half-chicken meal, served with fries and tasty fresh salad.  Piri piri sauce optional (but highly recommended), or just fine by itself.  I dunno, the last time I ate at a Yelp 4+ stars rated place in MTL I had to fish out at least a Borden (AKA the Canadan Benjamin).  Here I whip out three Macs and got me some loonies and a toonie, that's good for me and the lady, plus we got leftovers good for breakfast the next day.  How about that.  If that's not value for the Canadian dollar, I don't know what is.  So yeah.  If you are in Montreal and just so happens to be in the Plateau, GO.  Pick up a Turkish coffee from Cafe Replika nearby, savor the evening, admire the street murals and await your turn with chicken goodness.
No doubt the best Portuguese chicken in Montreal. The chicken is grilled to perfection. The meat is moist and tender, not to mention juicy. Served on heap of golden crispy  fries. I can go on and on about how good the chicken is, but there are almost 150 plus reviews about it. Another thing no one here mentioned are the chouriço's. They are really good. Spicy sausage Portuguese style.  Lines are REALLY long, but they move fast. You place your order, pick it up and go to the cash register and pay by Cash or Debit. No credit cards accepted. Did I mention the food here is very cheap??? And yes, Their Nata's are good too.But you have to visit this place mainly for their chicken. P.S. : Definitely NOT a good place to visit if you are Chicken  Food -  Really GoodService - FastAmbiance -  What Ambiance???Worth the money - Sí
This review is for the chicken (I'm a big protein fan). I wish this was in NYC. The chicken was moist, perfect spices, and the hot sauce had a good amount of heat. If you want more heat, ask for more sauce. Surprisingly, the side salad that came with it was perfect to cool off the heat from the hot sauce on the chicken. Fries were good, but I can't say I remember too much about it. Service is fast and the place really seems more for take-out or eat and run. Use your fingers when eating this chicken and eat everything off the bone. I didn't try the pastries, but maybe next time when I return to Montreal. Simple (protein) food, decent price.. I can't find anything wrong with that.
First meal in Montreal was a success!  Ordered a whole chicken and poutine, which was way more than enough for 2 people.  The chicken was very flavorful and moist.  The poutine was similarly delicious. My first poutine so I can't compare to traditional versions (this had chicken, fries, gravy and cheese - what's not to like?).  Loved everything about this meal!
Stopped by Romados to get some take out lunch. I heard about this place through Anthony Bourdains show "The Layover". Usually most of my experience of finding places to eat through TV shows have been pretty good. Sadly this one wasn't one of the good experiences. The portion was great and the price was reasonable but the quality of food wasn't anything special. It was just plain old chicken and rice with fries and salad on the side. I was expecting something great but I guess my expectations were too high! Overall it was an ok experience, it's not like the food was bad or anything. Check this place out if you want a reasonably priced chicken place!
Went there yesterday hoping to get a tasty meal on an empty stomach. Sunday night around 6pm. I waited in line 20 mins, and a third of the line had passed. I still had 2/3rds in front of me, so I left, I couldn't wait another 40. I wish I could speak for the chicken, but it looks like not. Looks like they need to rethink operations.
Had the half chicken combo and it was pretty good. The chicken was flavorful with many herbs but slightly dry.  They pour a sauce over the chicken which was quite good and it came with a huge amount of fries. However, the bread they gave was stale, a real crime in this city!A good meal, though I wouldn't go out of my way next time.Nice staff who were very nice and accommodating.  I gave an additional star because of them!  Also, though the website states that they accept credit cards, they actually do not - only debit cards and cash.
Yay finally got to try Romados.. Really loved it.. Simple portugese chicken per quantity or in a sandwich. Nice big servings. Excellent crispy french fries. And a real feeling of experience and systematic quality to the place. I really loved the food. Simple, but nice and clean. I wouldn't cross down for it, but have found a favorite chicken place in the plateau.
The chicken is so juicy and moist.  Amazing.  Was not disappointed even after reading the reviews. Also, the fries were perfectly crispy and even more perfect with the chicken jus.
I was in vacation in Montreal, stayed at the Plateau area. There's a lot of restaurants in this location, so I tried Yeld that indicated Romados. They have a great chicken breast, pretty wet! Awesome french fries! Good cost! I definitely recommend it!
used to live in MTL and this was a staple of the city... A fire closed their doors for a while and they took the opportunity to give it a facelift. Chicken is second to none. Order for pickup to avoid crazy lineups mid day.
Amazing chicken! Their spices and sauce are simply addicting! The fries are delicious as well. The chicken is very oily, which gives it the great taste so I don't suggest eating it on a daily basis, but for a spur of a moment meal; fantastic!
HM not quite sure if i went on a bad day..but my chicken was SOOOOOO salty and therefore the poutine i ordered was salty as well because they put the same chicken on top. I couldnt finish it. The only thing i would give 5 stars to is their egg custard pies..they were DELICIOUS! i went back later that day just for another.
I'm dying after eating the half-chicken combo with fries, but it was definitely worth it. See you at the other side.
Would give them 1 star but that's not fair as I'm obviously in a hole in the wall joint and shouldn't expect a gourmet meal... So this review is solely based on the fries and service. I ordered a small fry to go and noticed they scooped the fries out of a metal bowl that wasn't even being heated.. The fries were dry and barely warm. I requested gravy but they said they didn't offer it except for with poutine?!?!  But I don't really eat dairy so I just wanted gravy and would pay extra.. Nope they refused to sell me gravy. I only had a few bites as the fries were dry and then when I got home (TMI sorry) I rushed to the bathroom. I guess my system rejected this crap.PS- no A/C during 33 degree weather.My tip to you: Go here when it's busy and make sure there's a bathroom nearby.
Chicken was too salty.  Ask for the hot sace.  Though it's oily,  really helps mediate the saltiness of the seasoning.  The combo comes with a small salad, fries (too much), and bread roll.  If you come you must try their Portuguese tarts.  Limited seating. If you can't find any, walk down the street to a public park with benches and enjoy there.
Chicken is great... Charcoal taste without being burnt or dry. Fries are delicious: great colour, great texture and seasoned with steak spice. Line is long, but moves pretty fast. Even faster if you call ahead. Service is efficient and friendly. Negative points: The spicy sauce is more of an oil than a sauce. Bifana is also too oily.
Swiss Chalet, step aside.  Kenny Rogers chicken, step aside. This is the best rotisserie chicken you'll have in your life, and paired with the seasoned french fries, this place earns it's consistently high rating. A combo consisting of 1/2 chicken, salad and fries with spicy BBQ sauce (for only $10, extremely reasonable for the quality) is enough to feed two very hungry people. It's cost effective, it's delicious, it's Rotisserie Romados! :)P.S. Don't forget to pick up a Portugal custard tarts in the neighborhood! It's as authentic as it can get in Montreal!
the chicken is tres tres bien. Especially the sauce. Definitely will be there again!
4.5 stars. They do three things (mostly): chicken, frites, and salad. I think there's also sausage. But they do really good chicken and frites. Salad was mostly onions. We got 1/2 a chicken, fries and salad for 2, plus 2 desserts and a drink for $35. Super quick, not a lot of places to sit down. More to go style. Big bakery case with lots of goodies that are indeed tasty. One of our best meals in Montréal,  especially after we've had so many more expensive misses.
Their poutine au poulet was delicious; freshly made, crispy, well seasoned fries,  tasty gravy,  cheese,  and great chicken, all in abundance for $10.
I never thought I would compliment a 'fast food' joint's chicken this way - juici-cious, tender, flavorful with a mesmerizing chili sauce to die for. This is the place to go for Portuguese chicken in Montreal.The place has gotten quite the following, the never ending line that goes straight out the door right up to closing time is evidence enough. Their chicken entrees, comes in all sizes in multiple of 1/4 with tasty crunchy fries and salad, comes out to be under $10 or an entire chicken for sharing between four people for $24, what a steal. The chicken itself is extremely tender, every string of meat down to the last of breast tastes juicy, no evidence of dryness at all. The sauce was delicious, it reminds me a little of the flavor from China's smelly tofu, slightly spicy and full of flavor. The accompanying portion of fries has an rustic and chewy flavor, resembling the richness of the skin of potato wedges. We inhaled the meal in under a few minutes. If you are at or around Mont Royal, do stop by and grab a meal from this famed place.
Dropped by here during a lunch a few weeks back.Let's be honest. The chicken in this place is probably the best you'll probably get in Montreal. It's tender, juicy and flavorful and comes with side orders that are equally impressive.I need to visit this place someday soon with friends and experience it all again.The price tag? Completely reasonable and in fact, another attraction to come eat at this fine establishment.The service is about as solid as it gets.If you have never eaten at Romados... why are you depriving yourself such an experience?
Amazing chicken for the price your paying ... Always a line up in there so you cannot be in a hurry when going there
WOWZA! Who would've thunk it that there were so many awesome ways to flip a chicken over a fire!I love Huli Huli (Hawaii), Peri Peri (Peru), Rotisserie Tandoori and just plain old BBQ Rotisserie! Now I can add Portuguese chicken to my list. Carnivores, Romados is a must eat when you are here in Montreal!Like most great foods Romandos is located in a skech neighborhood (I was later informed that it is in fact a sought after neighborhood to live in so my bad! ) about .2mi away on a side street off of the post St. Denis but man it was worth the risk! As soon as you veer off of the main drag you can smell the chicken! Just follow your beak (no pun) and it will lead you to the spot.The place looks fresh and remodeled. Judging by the setup, they are prepared for insane lines. Luckily for me there was no line at 8pm and I was in and out in less than 5 minutes. I got a 1/2 chicken and some unnamed desserts; one tart and another thing that looked like an ice cream come. Dude the chicken smell filled up my car and turned me into one of those eating and driving people that we all hate. The chicken was awesome! No need for sauce, ketchup or any other dressings. It was nice and juicy and even glazed the fries with some of its awesome. The salad was a bust as the chicken was hot off the fire and caused the greens to wilt before I could eat it. Keep the greens and give me more chicken!One last note: Cute Portuguese girls that speak French: Mind Blowing!!
Good a bit over hyped but solid chicken nirvana.  Wish they provided more salad rather than cover everything in French fries. Not sure why a dinner roll goes with the meal too many carbs. My total with a vitamin water and $5 of their magic spices with half a chicken was $21 or around $15 without the spices.
I firmly believe that this would be a top chicken experience for anyone who tries it. Fries are excellent. Chorizo is good not great. Custard pastry was top notch as well. Get there early, order a chicken and enjoy. Definitely roll.
The best chicken that I ate in a very long time. The juicy meat and the spicy sauce with the salty fresh fries are just delicious!
Worth the hype is right... I think this was my highlight of eating in Montreal.  The sauce on the chicken is some kind of flavour explosion.  The portions are huge the atmosphere of get in-get your food- get out is really fun (seriously it's like you're on an episode of seinfeld but the staff are SOOO warm and friendly!!).  There is NO OTHER CHICKEN like this in THE WORLD! YUM! GO!
Simply one of the best rotisserie chicken in Montreal. Being Portuguese this says a lot. When I lived in Montreal I loved coming here. It has an authentic atmosphere and no frills attitude. Get your chicken, eat here or get out. Done. Its one of the places I miss the most.
Fantastic Portuguese chicken. I have had it from many different places, but this one is different and amazing. I love the fact that the potatoes are french fries. Hot sauce is delicious. This is definitely my go-to rotisserie place when I am in Montreal. Recommend 100%.
Romados has started doing delivery service and it's not amazing.  I love their food (I wish I could love their sauce, but it has gluten in it) but Romados is really awful if it isn't fresh. My fries came cold with a lukewarm chicken carcass.  Dry and inedible.  Maybe you should stick to in-store or figure out your takeout containers!
A cold snowy night in Montreal and the most important question pops up....what do we eat?! My friend suggested we take out from Romados so we did. I will admit, I wasn't too excited for just chicken, but omg it was so worth it. We split a meal of a whole chicken, fries and salad. The salad was huge and I swear the fries were never ending and they were REALLY good fries too! The chicken was moist and spicy and so delicious, I now dream of it.
very good place for roast chicken,  half chicken combo is enough for two person. The price is also very good. I will try their other food next time.
Best deal in the Plateau.  A half chicken dinner with fries and salad for under ten bucks, you can't go wrong.  Highly recommend it for take out.  If you don't live in the neighborhood, get some chicken, grab some beers from a Depanneur, and find a park bench and enjoy!
My boyfriend and were visiting Montreal for a week when we came across Romados.  Their chicken was so unbelievably good that we had to come back three or four times over the course of our vacation.  It's rotisserie style with perfectly crisped skin and delicious sauces.  It's also very reasonably priced.  I would highly recommend this too anyone who appreciates chicken (we both agree it is the best chicken we've ever had)
This place has the best Portuguese chicken in town! You just wait in line and order a quarter, half, or whole chicken (do get it spicy!), plus salad and fries on the side. At the cashier, you pick up bread and order dessert from their glass counter filled with delectable treats, and sit at one of the bars-tooled tables and dig in. The chicken is crispy, well seasoned, and cooked to perfection. The fries are fresh, sweet, and crunchy; you can dip them in the chicken's spicy sauce. And the salad dressing is just perfect!
My well anticipated visit to Romados! Having heard so much of this rotisserie, I arrived with high expectations.We each ordered the 1/4 chicken meal, which comes with a side salad and a mountain of fries. Gosh. If you are craving fries, these will have you satisfied for weeks to come. Apparently you can ask for rice too (50/50), which I regret not doing because the meal gets quite dulling with only fries.OK, now about the actual food. It was good, but not enough to leave me breathless. Now I gotta say, the chicken was well cooked and very savoury. The side salad stole the show for me. Fresh, crunchy, aromatic. I need their salad dressing. It balances the dryness of the rest of the lunch. Fries were slightly cold and not crispy enough, yet the spices generously coated on the fries still leave you wanting more. Tip for those who still haven't visited Romados yet... Get yourself something to drink !! or bring a bottle of water with you. The amount of salt you ingest is crazy!VERDICT: I liked their food, everything was very flavourful, but sometimes a little bit overwhelming (saltiness). Price is very reasonable considering the abundance of food served. 1/4 chicken is definitively more than enough for lunch. Location is not optimal and it's a hassle to find a place to sit. Good idea as takeout to go for picnic. I will return if ever I am by the neighbourhood, I am intrigued to try their poutine!
okay so, again guilty as charged for only finding out this place from The Layover, but I did do some research and was able to get a TeamBuy coupon for this place.The place is on the corner of a building. I think you just have to listen to your nose and also look for the line of ppl that are going inside. Sometimes there is also a line out the door!This place is pretty much the staple of every Montreal visit including Schwartz Deli. So what you order is the Roast Chicken with fries, extra extra hot sauce, egg tart for dessert & your soda of choice to wash it down. The  chicken is delicious, perfect, moist and all types of description for amazing Portuguese chicken! Dont get me started on the price, for what you get its a great frickin deal! I would probably eat here once a day if I could!LIke what Ryan T said, "Just writing this review makes my mouth water and brings back fond memories of my trip to Montreal." and this is soo true!Trust me on this, Romados is a MUST hit up spot when your in Montreal. Do not leave MTL without trying it!.
Montreals classic spot for Portuguese chicken.  Great food, wonderful service.  Avoid the rush times (noon on weekends or from 6-8pm to avoid the line ups)... but it is worth the wait for good quality/price meal.
I just don't understand what's so special about this place. The food was extremely greasy and the chicken wasn't anything special.Maybe I'm being a little harsh because the place was extremely overhyped. Not a good location to sit down and eat.
I've been hearing about this spot for a while now.Finally decided to go and try it. We couldn't really find parking so we took our order to go. The place was pack no where to sit, and the line up was bit long. All good signs for me!I wanted a chicken sandwich, but unfortunately  they didn't have any sandwiches left.  We opted for a chicken poutine and a side order of fries.Chicken poutine : Huge portion! Alot of cheese Lord knows I love me some cheese!!!!They could have added more chicken, but I'm not complaining. My friend really enjoyed it , thought it was one of the best he ever had. Personally I tried it and didn't really like it. In my defense I'm not a  big poutine fan. Fries : Well i cant really describe them  much. Plain ol french fries. Our total was 14$ Overall this place was worth going to. I will be going back, in hopes to finally try their sandwiches.  The service was fast and the cooks were super nice. Price wise very cheap, it wont make you go broke.Romados you got a fan!
MUST try. Famous Portuguese chicken spot. The chicken was amazing. Some of the best I've had. The fries were seasoned with salt and pepper and were really good. The dressing on the salad was also really good. 2 1/4 leg dinners with water and 2 buns for $20. Very affordable. Their natage must be very popular because they sold out.
Perhaps this was highly reviewed for the amount of food you get for your dollar.  If I lived by here I'd probably eat here quite a bit, but overall, we were not impressed.  Chicken was fairly dry.Perhaps we came at a bad time, check it out if you're in the area and are looking for a cheap filling meal.
We found this place through Yelp.  It is out of the way but not too hard to find.Chicken was like crack! (YAAAAS)Fries (YAAAAS)Half chicken with a ton and a half of fries with side salad for under $10! The only down side to this place is that it isn't a sit down place. Only had 6 small tables on the side with such a small place. Fast service ad good price for the amount food. Would Recommend!
This chicken must of had voodoo performed on it because nothing can be this delicious. I went with half a chicken and it still wasn't enough. I'm officially on the quest to find chicken that can top this but I think I'm just being delusional.
So glad we decided to try this place while we were in Montreal! Delicious, cheap, friendly and with a unique cool Portuguese vibe. Best neighborhood chicken spot ever? Quite possibly! Portuguese passion fruit soda went really well with the food!
What can I say, Romados Romados. You're a tasty lover ;) You're not coming to Romados for the ambience. In fact, I've never actually eaten at Romados. Sometimes the lineups are very long. The wait is worth it though because the BBQ chicken is that good, hands down. Big portion, little price. Fries are nicely seasoned but VERY greasy. Romados is best with a side of Netflix or the park when the weather is nice! Outside of that: great meal, great value, and great BBQ chicken. Once the fries get cold you should throw them out because they won't be edible anymore. You'll know when you're in a Romados kinda mood.
My new favorite fastfood joint.I dropped by here with a friend that wanted some good poutine and decided to trust the yelp reviews.I was BLOWN AWAY. 9$ for that huge ass delicious poutine?! Dear god. That was the best chicken I have ever tasted in my life. It was cooked to perfection and the fries were also incredibly good. The gravy seemed spicy but not nearly enough to create discomfort. (to yelpers reading this, I normally can't take spicy.)My friend couldn't even finish her poutine and I was filled for the whole day (rare feat for a 215lbs 6'2 guys).ABSOLUTE.MUST.TRY. They don't have much selection food-wise though but the taste and price make it up by far. Incredible selection of Portuguese drinks and well-priced deserts as well.The only bad thing is that there is no place to sit.  The tables and chairs are practically all squeezed in and it is kind of uncomfortable especially if you're taller.GO HERE.Edit: Still freaking out at how good the damn chicken is. If I wouldn't be 400lbs by the end of the month, I'd eat here everyday. P.S. Everything else on the menu is also well worth it like the half-chicken.
Good food + generous portion = Woohoo! As good as it gets!It was freezing & we were starving! We stopped by this place because we saw this place was crowded. We thought, this place has to be good & YES! THIS PLACE IS GOOD! We got the poutine with shredded chicken & the half a chicken. The poutine is definitely different than most of the poutines that we've tried. Poutine mixed with shredded chicken is definitely a great idea. It was definitely a great combination. The chicken itself is flavorful, delicious! The half a chicken with fries & salad is about $7.40 & the poutine is $9. We spent about $21 with a drink. It was definitely worth it.Great value! Friendly staff!Highly recommended!
A fairly long line up when we walked-in but people were willing to wait; and that says something about the food. There is an option to call 30min ahead and you can pick it up when you're there to avoid the line up (which I will be doing next time). When my friend and I got our food, there were limited seating but we found one anyway! The food was delicious! The spices were on point, fries were good, the chicken was awesome! I recommend this place!
It is horrid trying to get through traffic in Montreal just to get to Romados, but it was worth the frustration when we finally got our food. Rue Rachel was closed down and St Laurent was packed but we finally found a parking spot and made our way to Romados.The place is pretty small and there was  a LONG line. The line on the left is for people who haven't phoned in an order and the line on the right was for people who had ordered by phone and is coming by for pickup. In my honest opinion, both lines seemed to be going at the same pace. There are also sodas on the side - I recommend the pineapple soda.We ordered the $20 family meal which can easily feed a family of 3-4. A whole chicken chopped up, drenched in sauce, a HUGE bag of poutines, and a box of salad. ALL FOR $20. It is a cheap meal and fed my family of 4 pretty well.The chicken is moist and the sauce goes really well with it. The poutines are AWESOME and are well salt and peppered. The salad has a vinagarette sauce which makes you less guilty for eating something that is so greasy. Overall, a really good meal that is flavorful. There is limited seating and the place gets pretty packed. Most people were taking their food to go.The servers were super friendly. Then again, most of the people that I've met in Montreal are super friendly. Bottom Line: Traveling around Montreal? This is definitely a hole in the wall to try out!
Good and affordable fast food.
It's a fast food place. Almost feeling like a cafeteria. Friends and I came in for dinner and the line was pretty long, so you know, it's good. If you don't get chicken here, you shouldn't have gone here in the first place!Anyway, I split with a friend half a chicken combo with fries. Warning, they DUMP tons of fries on top of the chicken/salad. The chicken was juicy and the sauce is really nice and a kick to it. The fries are really good. It's the way I like it, lots of pepper. The lady at the cashier offered bread, and i said yes. This is a lot of carbs and it's gonna be a pretty heavy meal.I really wish that they had egg tarts at the time. But they an array of desserts next to the cashier. There are some seats and tables along the window. If you're with a big group, it would be better if you went to a park to eat and have an impromptu picnic.
I came to Romados quite a few times, always leaving satisfied. The chicken meals are packed with flavours. The spicy sauce, the salad dressing, the fries seasoning, everything is perfectly done. However, the chicken itself is a bit too dry for my liking. And the dining room is too small for the number of diners.
I treat this place like a cheap guilty pleasure - and there's nothing wrong with that! Moist chicken dripping with spicy oil, buried in about 2 days' worth of puffy, seasoning-coated fries. As long as you're ok with a 20+ minute lineup, it's amazing - be sure to ask for extra sauce!
The chicken is great and juicy and the sauce is tasty -but greasy-. Best portuguese chicken I've tasted in Montreal. The fries used to be amazing before they renovated but now they are just ok. I think they started skimping on the spices with the fries and sadly their fries were better than their chicken for comfort food, imho.Plain salad and rice. The sandwiches are just the chicken in a bun. Nothing fancy.The pastries and bread aren't worth it, to be honest.TIP:The seating is limited and is that of a Deli. If you aren't planing on eating in, I recommend ordering ahead of time via phone. You do NOT want to be stuck in one of the busy long line on a weekend. You have your own much shorter line if you order by phone.
Don't let the line up scare you, it moves quicker than it looks. This is hands down the best chicken you'll find in Montreal. The poutine is great, and boy I'm glad they now do delivery. The staff are nice which is surprising considering the volume they deal with. NOTE: Have your order ready by the time you arrive to the front, otherwise the crowd of people behind you might string you up by your toes. It doesn't matter what you order on the menu, you'll love it.
Wow, I just popped in here to take a look, and found these Portuguese egg tarts which I haven't had since my trip to Lisbon.  They are great, in Lisbon I was eating 2 or 3 of them a day, I liked them so much!So at this wonderful bakery on Rachel Street I bought two of these lovely Pasteis de nata and ate them for a treat.  They were delicious!  A taste just like I remembered from Portugal!  Obrigado!
Of all rotisories tasted so far, definitely the best! Take out gives you extremely generous portion of fries/salad to enjoy while taking in the comforts one of the nearby parks or even the mountain ;). Oh! Don't forget to get a few natas for dessert (traditional Portuguese sweet egg tarts) enjoy!
Don't go in here expecting a dining experience. It's pretty much a fast food counter that delivers. Not the fastest as there are tons of tourists that don't know what they are getting, but the line moves. Do yourself a favor and call in your order before hand to save time. The food is excellent! For $11 bucks total, you can have half a chicken and a ton of fries(you can opt out from the salad and get more fries). Everything is seasoned really well and you have wonderful flavor in each bite! The food will definitely hit the spot if you come in hungry. For global customers, this would be one tier higher than Nando's in taste!
It's just plain chicken with a pile of French fries - flavorless .  No chimicurri sauces.  Bland no paazing.  Yawn.  Guess it's considered cheap though for Montreal.
Absolutely delicious! So tasty! The chicken and the fries are to die for. Very heavy and kind of hard to digest though.
Quarter leg meal with one of those guarana antarctica sodas.  why order anything else anywhere else?  Bring it to the park (cross Rachel and go down Bouillon for a minute), and clean up after yourself!  If you're worried it's going to be busy, call ahead and pick it up from the right side of the window where you usuall place your order.
Awesome place to get a heaping pile of greasy, delicious chicken and fries. As American tourists, we found the menu (which is mostly pictures) very confusing, but in the end it didn't matter. Go up to the counter and ask for half a chicken. They'll put it in a box with a huge helping of fries and a salad. Throw in a drink for around 14$ Canadian.Once you sit down to eat, you'll have to excavate your chicken from under the fries and it'll be an oh-so-delicious process. The chicken juices and BBQ mingle with the fries and make everything taste that much more delicious.PRO TIP: The first night we went, the place was super crowded and we tried to eat standing up. A helpful local suggested that we take our dinners a block (north)east on Rue Rachel to a neighborhood bar. The bar was next to a bike shop and had absolutely no sign on it, but was a fantastically chill place with a sort of 60's vibe to the decor. Perfect spot to enjoy some beer with our chicken and fries.
good roasted chicken!!
Great prices, so make sure to go early to beat the lunch / dinner crowd.Dark meat was good, but the white meat was slightly too dry.So-so rice. Get some other side.Not so good Pastel de Nata. Made off site and was delivered very slowly. It was also too sweet.Still To try:  piri piri chicken, Chouriço, fries, less time sensitive pastries
THIS PLACE HAS THE BEST POUTINE I ever had!! Not to mention THE BEST CHICKEN ever!! And the combination of the 2 is like a pair made in heaven. I love love coming to this place. The only issue I have is that I sometimes have trouble finding a table, even though I don't usually come at peak hours. But no worries, there are counters you can eat and stand at, which is fine by me. So worth it!!!
Oh my god, Romados, you are so damn good. How I have missed you. Went on a Friday night after a little tennis session and the place, as usual, had a line out the door. Lucky for my friend and I, we were smart and remembered my tip #2 from my last review. In case you didn't see/read it, it's call ahead of time. Why? 'Cause then you get to skip to my lou to the line to the right and are out the door in 10 minutes instead of waiting for an hour in longing/hatred of the people skipping the line. We took our orders of 1/2 spicy chicken and fries deliciousness to Jeanne Mance park as the weather was gorgeous and proceeded to chow down. It was heaven - chicken moist and tender as usual and so, so many fries. Almost endless. It always makes me chuckle how they give you a "side" portion of salad...yeah right, if you want vegetables, you are in the wrong place bubba.Anyways, for $9.75, you cannot go wrong. Still one of my favourite places in Montreal.
Such an important institution in the Montreal good eats scene, the December 2012 fire generated waves of "Oh my god NO!" amongst its disciples! Fortunately its back....with a vengeance (before it was Romados 2: Romados harder)My first foray here was in 2005, I just moved to the hood and was getting to know the area better. Walking along Rachel, there was that unmistakable smell, that scent of grilled portuguese chicken. (Note line ups here are not just insane, they are UNSANE! Best to order for pick-up ahead of time)Back then there was this tiny adorable Portuguese lady who took your order from the window (a really really tiny window before they renovated). From personal experience and observation, this lady would flirt with every man, young or old. I would order in my bad portugeshe - "Peito du frangu avec fritash et salada" to which she would respond with an impressed "bravu". There were times when i would just order only the chicken, she would ask in a disappointed tone "pas da fritash?, but when no one was looking, would sneak in some fries for me!!!!!She doesn't work there anymore, but the quality of this place is everlast. I do however miss the soccer club scarfs that adorned the walls. Now I am unsure if I should be pro Benfica or Porto or Sporting Lisbon when i enter this place!
So I wander into this Portuguese chicken joint (after some Yelping) for a late breakfast and stand in line as I watch the chickens on the rotisserie.  I see the big takeout containers and I'm hungry so I order the 1/2 chicken combo for a whopping ~$10 - which comes with a boatload of fries, rice and salad and spicy sauce on the chicken.  For some reason, they also threw in a dessert tart and a dinner roll at the cashier station - I must have nodded at some prompt when I wasn't really paying attention.  (I do that often...)  I think I paid a total of $13 with a pop.With my chicken box in hand - I realized my first error.  This tiny space had no more 'real' seats with tablespace.  So I walk over to the little mini-bench, give PersianDude a nod, he shuffles over and I squat down beside him and we both each chicken off our laps.  For some reason, this somehow enhanced the experience.  Don't know why.First off - the amount of food you get is huge.  Take a look at my pictures.  The fries are damned good and are completely mounded on top of the chicken.  It took a good 5 - 10 minutes of eating and maneuvering before I got to the chicken.  The chicken is delicious and moist - wished the sauce was spicier but this was damned good roasted chicken.  Seriously - I should have probably stopped eating about 1/3 the way through because I was just full of fries and chicken grease.  This is coming from a fat bastard.But I watched PersianDude demolish his chickenbox and I didn't want to spend the rest of my day carrying a box of chicken with me.  So I willed my way through the chicken - it was good but if I was to cry, chicken grease would have came out of my eyes.  After about 40 minutes of focused eating, I polished my box off.  I threw the dinner roll which had a density of a hockey puck away and wrapped up my dessert tart.I didn't know it at the time - but this chicken box at 11AM was the last thing I would eat for 24 hours.  Fast forward to 10AM the next morning and waking up hungry from a night of drinking, I rediscover the dessert tart on my nightstand.  Wow - Romados - you know me better than I know myself.
The chicken is perfect. The fries delicious. The side salad even hit the right spot ;)
I ordered from Ramados through Just Eat. When my order was half an hour late, I called the restaurant to ask about it. The woman who answered the phone was incredibly dismissive. I was actually taken aback at how rude she was. When I asked her if she knew how much longer it would be she said she had no way of knowing and hung up on me. I finally got my food and in fact, the chicken is good but my salad arrived soggy. I'm just shocked at how outrageously bad their customer service is.
Two visits in one trip pretty much sums up how much I enjoyed Romados. The thing I love about this is the chicken first of all and you get a complete meal for a very reasonable price. Let's start with the chicken. The chicken is marinated in their special blend of Portuguese goodness. It's then butterflied onto their rotisserie racks which is cooked slowly over a open flame. While the racks turn, the fat renders from the chicken and juices from the chicken drips onto the neighboring racks causing each chicken to base it it's own juice. This process keeps the chicken from staying moist and tender. To order the process is quite simple. You can either order the chicken by itself or combo meal which come with fries, rice, small salad, and roll. The chicken comes in the following sizes, from 1/4, 1/2, to full, and spicy or not. If you order 1/4 chicken, you can either request leg or breast. The fries are enough for 2 to 4 skinny people or 2 fat people. In other words, they give you a lot of fries. The fries are piled on the whole plate covering everything so you have to dig through the fries to get to the chicken. The rice is not so great. It doesn't have much flavor and pretty dry for my taste. The side salad is pretty much that, a side salad topped with their dressing.In addition to having great chicken they also have a variety of baked goods. I do not know the name of these wonderful delights, but the egg custard thing was awesome. It reminded me of the the Chinese version that I see at dim sum and Asian bakeries. I also had their chocolate eclairs. I'm guessing it's more of a french thing than Portuguese, however the eclairs were delicious. Each eclair cost 1 Canadian dollar. Normally you find eclairs for 3x as much and much smaller. Seating is very limited, but from my experience, it seems like most people order their food to go.
Incredible! Chicken is fantastic. So tasty! Their chicken poutine is absolutely fantastic. Deserts are great too.  Custard pies are excellent. Prices are incredibly reasonable. Everyone should try this place
Pretty much the best Portuguese chicken on the Plateau. Not much else to say.
Update - I returned after 5 years. It's still the same deal: plenty of fries, chicken, and a homeopathic dose of salad. But that's OK. You're not going there if you're vegetarian or on diet.
some of the better rotisserie chicken that i've had. didn't really know portugese chicken was a thing in montreal. glad someone told us. $9 for a 1/4 chicken and giant pile of fries + salad. one of the better meals we had on the entire trip.
My wife and I treked to Romados and I was in sad that they didn't offer sandwiches on the weekend and I was about to leave, but I regressed and got back into the 10 minute line for the chicken plate. My wife said, "You have to at least try this place" So I ordered the chicken breast plate with only salad. He looked at me kind of weird that I didn't want a pound of fries and 600 calories of rice with it.The chicken was roillng on about 12 sckewers over coal in the background. The chicken was juicy and the salad was wonderful with the dressing they put on top.They had huge bottles of water for $1, which was awesome. We were happy!Everyone there was super happy, they were eating 3,000 calories of food, no problem, so I am guessing all the walking in Montreal keeps these people fit.Overall, a great place, but I really would have liked to try the sandwich.I am glad my wife made me stay and try their classic food instead of moving on.
Easily one of the best cheap meals involving chicken I've ever eaten. There are two lines, one for order and the other was for pre-order. I had to use Google translate to figure that out. My gf and I got there around 7PM and the line up was long but moved steadily, took about 15 minutes to reach the front with around 8 people ahead of us.Ordered the half chicken(spicy) with fries and salad for $9.75. Got to the hotel and opened up the container and was in shock at how much fries there were. The chicken was moist and flavourful and the fries were a bit soggy but pretty good over all. The hot sauce was not spicy but had a nice taste to it.Overall we were very pleased with the meal and would definitely go there again when we get a chance.
Recipe for a perfect summer picnic:Line up at Romados for a combo per hungry person. You will get a huge heap of chicken, hot off the charcoal grill (my "cuisse" combo had at least 2 thighs in it), peppery golden fries, salad, and a roll for about $8. Say yes to the hot sauce. Grab an interesting-looking drink from the cooler and lots of extra napkins, then walk over to Park Lafontaine, sit by the pond and gobble it all up. Even after eating your fill, you will probably have enough leftovers to make yourself a sandwich using the yummy bun.Catch a show at Théâtre de Verdure in the evening as the sun goes down. Walk back to the métro in the twilight, eating your sandwich as you go.I hear there are great desserts at Romados, too, but I honestly don't know how anybody could eat dessert after that big dinner. Maybe a separate trip?
Best chicken in town! So juicy & tasty.. its fun to go in the summer so you can pick up & go to the park scross the street and hsve a mini piknik , its awesome , its very cheap snd they really spoil you with the french fries.
One if the most fun stops in our trip to Montreal. This place was a true local experience. Located in the Rachel St. Laurent area, we were trying to decide which Portuguese BBQ place for dinner and we're really glad we decided on this! Unbelievably seasoned rotisserie chicken with piles of amazing fries dumped on top, and a delicious but simple salad on the side. All for about $12 each, and the two of us probably could have split one order. The place was packed and deservedly so. Seating is limited as a warning. But what a nice way to warm up on a cold night than feasting in savory chicken and hot fries.
The chicken is sooooo tasty!  Place is crowded, loud, and hot to eat-in during the summer, but it is DEFINITELY worth it. Line was long, but moved quickly. Order the spicy sauce for a real kick. Meal comes with fries, salad, and dinner roll (we opted for more fries over rice).  Chicken falls off the bone and is quite tasty. Very greasy, but hits the spot. And super cheap considering it's so much food!
I shared the 1/2 chicken and fries + salad with my husband for lunch and it was plenty of food. Humongous pile of delicious food for just $10. You won't find anything this cheap and tasty around here. Highly recommended!
Stopped by here for lunch during our Montreal trip. It wasn't too busy on a Tuesday afternoon thankfully so we got our food quickly and found some open seats. Their seating is limited but there is a park nearby so that wouldn't have been a bad idea to take it to go and eat there. We got the half chicken which came with so much fries. The chicken was seasoned so well and the sauce is very good. I thought the half chicken was more than enough to share between two people.
Easily one of my favourite places in Montreal, I find myself coming back here again and again even though I live on the other side of the city. No nonsense, just walk up to the counter, place your order, and walk away with a cut of juicy, flavourful chicken straight off the grill, splashed with piri-piri sauce (they'll always ask if you want it, but the answer should be obvious) and buried under a mountain of deliciously spiced french fries. All for about 10 dollars. What more could you need?Sure enough, it gets very crowded here, with lines often reaching all the way to the door. It always moves quickly, but then there might not be anywhere to sit down!
Love this place! Not much to add except that until my last visit last week, I had tolerated the fries as a simple accompaniment to the star (the chicken with amazing spicy sauce!), BUT on my last visit, I decided to stray from ordering the usual $9.75 plate of half-chicken/fries/salad. I ordered a full chicken and the fries for 2 people. This time they put the fries separately, in a bag, and this allowed them to be way less soggy. I was able to appreciate their seasoning for the first time this way. Anyway, no matter what, it's a win-win going here! And pick up some sweets from their bakery section while you're there, some natas or the cookies and cream type dessert (called something like Cream from Heaven). Yum!!
Chicken was amazing. Barely had any fries because they were all eaten by my friends when I finally had a chance to grab a plate. The Natas (sp?) are to die for!!
Best Chicken in Town! Smoked over charcoal with an either Spicy or mild sauce, Awesome fries spiced just right, nice little salad with a great little dressing! Add to that some breads, desserts or beverages and you have yourself one heck of a tasty meal! I recommend calling in advance for pickup to save the line up! No joke, if you plan on going on weekends be prepared to line up (there's a reason they are pretty long, its totally worth it!).Bon Apetit!
No visit to Montreal is without a trip to Romados. The line ups are long but definitely worth the wait. Chicken is to die for.... This place has to have the best tasting Portuguese chicken I ever had. Fries are golden and tasty and comes with a Portugese style roll. Drown it down with a sumol and you're good to go.Tip: they have two lines "avec commande" (with order) and "sans commande" (without order) the avec commande line is for folks who has called in for a order and is generally a bit faster. Sans commande line is for folks who did not call in and usually has the longest line ups.
Hi everyone ! Here goes my  first review... I am a big foodie and my craving for spicy Indian style grilled chicken brought me to Ramados ( after extensive search online - Portuguese chicken). I ordered a half grilled chicken (spicy) for a take away. I was really surprised to see the large portion of fries with the three large pieces of chicken. The meat was falling off the bone and had all the flavors. The fries and the salad soaked in those flavors gave an added taste. Really tasty and absolutely delicious. Reasonable pricing.Though I would prefer more spice in the chicken but I have no complaints. I loved the food. I would surely visit them again.
Horrible chichen sandwich full of bones and the spicy sauce and fries are loaded with salt. I'm not going back anymore. This place is not as good as it used to be. Desert was undercooked such a big disappointment
I wish I could give this place more stars. A crowded and small resto, a bit chaotic if you're trying to place an order... The staff is all about business and will put you in your place if you try and cut the line... but the chicken!!! HOLY CHICKEN-NES!!! and the fries!!!! Every bite was better than the last one. It took all my might not to finish my half chicken plate (I stopped myself solely because I wanted to have it for lunch the following day as well).. A MUST TRY!!
Great good and excellent service for the price. Yumm yumm. Always a huge line for dinner!
This place is awesome.  The chicken is made to perfection and the fries are excellent.  One of the best places to get amazing Portuguese chicken.  The pastries are excellent as well.  Furthermore, this place is not expensive.  I suggest you call ahead of time to order your meal, because you could be faced with waiting in line when you get there, although the line is never a long wait.  Don't forget to ask for an extra helping of their amazing sauce, which can be served spicy or not. This sauce goes well with their fries.  Yummy !!  Definitely a 5 star !!
Some call chicken "the tuna of the turf." I don't, and I tend to avoid those people at social events. They have names for everything and it gets annoying. Where's the boy's room? "The Throne Zone" is upstairs. "The Piss Palace" is down the hall. Ugh, shut up.That said, I call Rotisserie Romados "the purveyor of the single greatest roasted chicken dinner I have ever had in my entire life, based on my level of hunger, state of sobriety and availability of Five Alive juice drink."From the millisecond we stepped through the front door, the unreal aroma of those no-longer-egg-laying, piri-slathered, fire-kissed birds and fresh baked bread had us throwing 'bows to skip the line. In our minds, anyway. Other Yelpers talk about the pastry counter that tempts the poultry patrons, but I cannot comment. I wanted - nay, NEEDED - chiggin.A mere 15 minutes and 18$ CAD later, we're presented with Styrofoam go-boxes overstuffed with tender white and dark meat, a mountain of crispy crinkle-cut fries and a surprisingly fresh salad of mixed greens tossed in a light (mustard?) vinaigrette. We sat, transfixed. I took a picture of chicken for the first time ever. We ate. My soul took a picture of chicken for the first time ever.Remember those people that name everything? They might also be the type to talk about fleeing the States in times of political strife. "Can you believe Congress?," they'll say, "That's it. I'm moving to Canada." Whatever. Rotisserie Romados, though? Totally worth revoking your US citizenship.Did I mention they have Five Alive in a can? The Québecois need to adopt me, stat. I'll do windows!
Again, over-hyped so I was expecting more. My chicken was dry and the portion was ridiculously big... but I can see why people like it. I prefer Janos for Portuguese chicken.
When I think of Montreal, Portuguese cuisine is not the first thought that comes to my mind.  Smoked meat and poutine may be the dishes that Montreal may be best known for, but you can add Portuguese Roast Chicken to that list.  At Rotisserie Romados, their Portuguese Roast Chicken is right up there with some of the best grilled chicken that I have eaten.  How good was the chicken? This was by far the best meal of my trip!Located in The Plateau neighborhood, Rotisserie Romados is about an 8-10 minute walk from the Mont Royal Metro station.  Upon first glance, I honestly thought that the outside facade of the eatery reminded me of a church.  That being said, this "church of chicken" is a fairly small eatery with a few seats if you choose to eat in, but primarily a place to order take out.  Besides the roast chicken, Rotisserie Romados also has a bakery that serves up a pretty respectable selection of mouth watering Portuguese pastries.As far as the food is concerned, let's just say that something is seriously wrong with you if you leave here hungry.  Eager to feast on some chicken that I had heard so much about, I ordered the 1/2 Chicken Plate that came with a salad and was covered with a  mountain of fries.  At only $8 CAD, this was such a great deal especially with the portions being so generous.  Grilled over charcoal, the roast chicken was extremely moist on the inside, but still retained a crispy crunch on the outside.  Although the chicken was probably tasty enough as is, I decided to have my chicken slathered with a spicy Piri Piri Sauce to get the full Portuguese Chicken experience since I had come all the way from Hawaii.  The spices from the Piri Piri sauce and the drippings from the chicken were the perfect sauce to dip my fries in to scoop up all that yummy flavor.If this were not good enough, the lady at the register also added in a free dessert to my lunch.  This would be more than enough for most people, but I always have room for dessert.  I do not speak any French or Portuguese, but I made sure to remember the words "Pastel De Nata."  This Portuguese Custard Tart was the perfect end to my chicken feast and just blew my mind by how creamy delicious it was.       Just writing this review makes my mouth water and brings back fond memories of my trip to Montreal.
Very delicious chicken. They ran out of bread when we were there (...it's a bakery...?) but we got the chicken plate (which came with a massive sub roll on the side so we ended up with sandwiches anyway. Very good food, good value and I would definitely go back.
Saltiest chicken I've ever had. Literally burned just to eat but I had showed up at the end of the day so maybe it was just a bad batch.
This place is worth a stop.  We split two 1/2 chicken dinners for two adults and one child and as others note there were fries left over.  I wanted to try their caldo verde soup but they were out by 7:00pm.  The spicy sauce was really quite good not searingly hot but rather piquant.  My 4 y/o went though the mild chicken with a smile.Make sure you look at the pastries before you finish paying.  We almost missed dessert!
Excellent smell but nothing outstanding. Good portion size.
My fiancé had the 1/4 chicken with spicy sauce and I had their poutine with chicken. It was AMAZING!!! I love their poutine, it was delicious and worth the calories!
Delicious!! Amazing Portuguese chicken. Best in the city. Good fries. But, really greasy and heavy. Be careful!
This is the heaven for budget eating. The most delicious chicken in town + great fries and not to forget amazing salad sauce! Tip: don't fill yourself with the fries at the beginning. Focus on the chicken. If u are not extremely hungry get the quarter + salad and fries. Half would be too much. Enjoy!Tip2: don't forget to have a cup of coffee just across at cafe neve. Espresso will help to digest this food :)
Needed a quick, kid-pleasing dinner while we were staying with friends, so we popped out to grab a chicken from Romados. SO GOOD! We live in a very Portuguese neighbourhood in Toronto, so we're no strangers to churrasco, but this stuff was awesome. The piri-piri sauce had me licking the container. We didn't get any sides, since we already had enough at home to make a meal, but I'm sure they're just as tasty.
Love the chicken! Used to have it every Sunday, Moved from Montreal but every time we come back this is our first stop, bringing home at least 2!
Yet another Montreal gem. Hands down the best Portuguese barbecue chicken Montreal has to offer, every other restaurant that is remotely good will still come AFTER Romados. You can smell it from down the street, it is inexpensive, and absolutely delicious. Whether you are ordering the perfectly cooked and spiced chicken, fries, salad, or pastries, your taste buds are in for the ride of their lives. Do not miss out on this place!
I don't even live in Montreal and I've been here a dozen times since it re-opened. It still is amazing good, awesome value. I'm sure there have been other reviews of the poutine they serve up these days. But regardless... that is what I had this time around and it was just heaven. Romados chips + 1/4 chicken + gravy made from the spicy sauce = deliciousness. If you haven't gotten it yet go and do that now. Also as a word of caution - the poutine portion is enormous.Always call ahead before coming. It's not like they take your order over the phone and set it aside; it just allows you to rock up in front of everyone and get your order in. Silly system but might as well take use of it.
Their chicken is best! But make sure you go before the peak times as the line ups are really long. Reasonably priced as well.
This is absolutely the most amazing chicken that i have had. Their chicken comes with a sauce on top that is to die for and you can even ask them to put it on the fries. The place is a small and mostly catered for takeout, nevetheless, there are some places to sit. Its not a place to go have a nice sit down but if you want the most amazing chicken and best portugese sause to take home or eat fast then this is where you need to go. I have eaten at the best restaurant in montreal and most expensive and this place is one of my favourites!
I only tried their Portuguese egg tarts here, but that's all i wanted and they were delicious. Perfectly flaky crust and creamy egg tart. I'm coming back here for my egg tart fix next time i'm in town!
This place is legit. Super moist and fresh chicken and good prices. You should be aware that fries for 2 is literally enough for 6 people so go hungry.
You HAVE to come here. Simply, Portuguese chicken is incredible. Or at least here. Also, they give you a huge amount of fries. They're delicious. BOTTOM LINE:If you're anywhere within a     10 mile radius, come here. I don't care if you have to make a day trip out of it, come here. You won't be disappointed.
Incase all the other 5-star reviews weren't enough, let me add my own:This chicken is the bomb. The end. That's all she wrote.Seriously though, when my mate was visiting from Calgary we ate here every week for 3 weeks, and in between visits we thought about coming to eat here. It was good all the times we went.The chicken is crispy, but the key is the sauce. Make sure you get extra sauce, 'cause that's where it's at. The fries are herbed, and cooked toIf you order a meal (chicken, chips) before 12 or 1pm you also get a free bread roll and a Portugese tart (!). Needless to say, this place is Legit Portugese, so they know how to make a tart.If you're in Montreal, want some good chicken, want to try a local institution, or any of the previous, just go here already.
We were directed to this place for quick pick up and go dinner for the family. You walk in then order from the cooks what you want. The cook we spoke with spoke very little English but after a few finger pointing we were good to go. We got 4  chickenbreast combos which came with half a roasted chickenbreast a small salad and a ridiculous amount of fries. I have two teanagers. That was a hit with them. You are asked if you want spicy or regular sauce poured on top. I went for spicy and it was awesome! Not too hot for you novices out there. You move to the right to pay but they should move the cash register to the right of the pastries!  There were some incredible looking deserts that I would have gladly inquired about had my wife not already paid for our meal! I guess I'll just have to come back for desert!
Oh Romados. I miss you so. I remember that first time when I had walked through your doors and headed straight to that line formed outside the food-serving window. I had just gotten the last chicken of the day, and the guy behind me had turned away all upset. I don't blame him. I would be mighty upset too if I had missed out on the heavenly chicken that you cook. I remember, that greasy-and-delicious-barbeque-chicken smell coming out of that window was INTENSE. It was a hurried experience. The sweet young lady standing on the other side of the counter shouted "PIQUANTE?" when I ordered the chicken and I wasnt sure what was happening, but 'piquante' is always a safe bet for me so I said "YES" and bam! She had the chicken legs in a little container, grabbed her brush and basted that piece of chicken with this greasy delicious-looking sauce before handing me the container and shouting "NO MORE CHICKEN SORRY!"I felt like a little kid who had just gotten the last ice-cream from the ice-cream man. I hurried off home clutching the precious container in my hand. As soon as I got home, I opened the container, took in the aroma wafting from the chicken, and dug in. I took the first bite, then the second, then the third... and I knew. You were irreplaceable. I would search far and wide, but nothing would ever compare. Its true, Romados. I might have to come back to Montreal for you.
It's worth all the hype !! Cheap, delicious, spicy, it can't get any better than Romados.    I don't know what they put in that spicy sauce they have on their chicken, but god damn is it addictive! Their egg tarts are also excellent but you probably won't have any more space left after you're done with the chicken and huge pile of fries!
The line moves quick and the chicken is delicious, perfect, moist, magique. The hot sauce is important. The pieces of meat are quickly cleavered for you as they are taken off the grill when you order so watchout for little bits of bone.  Order in advance to skip the big line and walk right up to the counter on the left hand side. Natas are one of my favourite foods ever so I always grab some of those as well. The staff are funny and at least trilingual, the Portuguese patter keeps the place running and I love seeing the patient smile when the old folks come in.
I had their chicken and bifana. Very delicious. They also have many desert items that are worth trying.
3.5 stars. If food was cheap but really heavy so it wouldn't be a place I would come very often.  Service wise, it's food court style. You place order, pay, grab food when it's ready then find a table or take it home.
Yes, portions and prices are fine and chicken cooked on charcoal enhances flavour- that is assuming the chicken is decent quality. Anyone raving about the chicken at this place has never eaten chicken that hasn't been pumped with hormones and god knows what else. There is a distinct difference between this and organic farm raised chicken. Yes, you get what you pay for but after trying it a number of times and being consistently disappointed about the taste and texture, my friends and I have vowed never to go back. I guess they are able to offer the prices they do due to the sheer volume of mass produced chickens they sell. If only they used a higher quality product...and were still able to maintain the necessary supply and prices. Then again, finding unadulterated food these days is becoming harder and harder and more and more expensive. Enjoy the assembly line chicken.
oh Romados how we miss thee (since moving from the plateau) let me count the ways....1. The barbecued chicken... with crispy carmelized bits that are full of flavour2. The Portuguese spices on the chicken3. The spiced hot fries4. The yummy spicy sauce they will drizzle on the fries and the chicken if you want... your choice spicy or really spicy...5. Large portions for the price6. Yummy bread - soft and lovely on the inside... crunchy and firm on the outside7. NATAS NATAS NATAS (need I say more? Probably not but I will anyways... if you love custard you need to have one of these... two... or 10.... if they let you pick go for the ones with lots of colour... the carmelization thing again....)8. Salads are fresh but because they are in with the hot stuff they get soggy really quick... so I don't miss those that much... 9. I would say I miss the rice if we ever got to eat it (the one time I did have it it was yummy)... but this place is always so busy that they run out of it early and I have rarely had it.... go earlier if you want it.10. NATAS NATAS NATAS... (and try the white bean tarts as well for an unexpected surprise... who thought beans would make a tasty dessert? )Well worth the wait in line... but if you want to avoid waiting at peak hours... phone your order in and pick up a half hour later.... the pre-order line is always way shorter. Be sure you do so before their 6 or 6:30 deadline... otherwise be prepared to be patient. If the line stretches to the door... plan to wait at least 45 minutes... but it will be worth it...Also note that they do have a few tables but often no room... more of a take out place at rush hour.... there are a few parks nearby - one in between de bouillion and hotel de ville streets about 1/4 of the way down and of course only a few blocks from mount royal park.... just remember to clean up after yourselves and use the garbages
If I had to base this review just on the chicken, it'd be 4 stars.  The chicken is indeed phenomenal, and the hot sauce and fries are pretty good too, but the rice is pretty bland and dry, and I wasn't a fan of the pastry that came with the meal either.  As far as a value meal goes, for $8 you get a ton of food.Stick to the chicken and you'll be just fine here.
I don't know WTF happened but I can tell you this:1) The chicken is still good, but it wasn't as good as before2) The salad was pathetic and I didn't eat a bite of the limp, nasty wet, water-laden salad3) The fries ruined everything for me -- excessive amount of them, dry, brown, soaked in dirty oil, DISGUSTING4) The natas they used to give as a freebie, are now a hybrid tart custard piece of crap5) The owner and his kids aren't really working much any more which has contributed to its declineKnow what? They're coasting on their name and fame. I'm not going back, except to buy natas once in a while.Not worth it any more to wait in line and then fight for a crappy seat that 50% of the time is not available.
Great chicken, great portion, affordable price. Chicken poutine from here is a boon.
This is a must-go-to for me when visiting Montreal.  It is simple, delicious and very affordable!  As a supreme lover of all things Anthony Bourdain, I discovered this spot on his short lived show, The Lay Over, and boy am I glad I followed his recommendation.  It is absolutely fast food, but incredibly good, well prepared fast food.  The long is line and there is limited indoor seating, but there is a small little park kitty corner across the street where I take my plate and go picnic.  The line moves very quickly and I always get the same dish:  1/2 chicken that comes with a small side salad with a simple Italian dressing and a mound of fries on top of it all.  You can vary the heat of the sauce the chicken is brushed with and I opt for medium that has a good bite.  There is nothing like eating the fries at the bottom of the container soaked in that dwindling chicken sauce, I can hardly do it justice!  The bakery offerings are unusual and fun while still offering all the basics as well.  Even though the chicken is amazing, the fries are my favorite and I keep telling myself I need to try the poutine.  It hasn't happened yet though, I need that sauce on the chicken!
The Portuguese people are known for their chicken; now I know why! Rotisserie Romados offers the most delicious chicken. The place isn't the most attractive or spacious, but that doesn't stop people from waiting in line to get some good food.After waiting in line for 30 minutes, I got my quarter chicken combo (chicken, salad & fries) - around $7. At my request, the chicken was smothered in spicy oil sauce which gave a nice mild spicy taste to the food. The chicken is very juicy, hot, tender and perfect! The salad was good and the fries were thick but lacked the crispiness I like, but they tasted really good too. The portions are gigantic- you've been warned. Romados doesn't have lots of seating space and is usually crowed. The bakery there seemed nice and the staff was nice and efficient. I didn't like how my hot food was placed in a floppy styrofoam box- yuck. Although that bothered me, I don't think it's going to stop me from coming back to this place.If you want some amazing chicken; I would highly recommend picking some up at Rotisserie Romados!
We had a rough idea of where this place was, but actually found it by following our noses. This was our first stop after rolling into town. We made our way inside and got in line with only a few people ahead of us. Once we took a good look at the menu, we noticed that the line behind us was out the door. We picked up lunch, which was so delicious and filling that we didn't need dinner that day. For ~$8 for a half chicken, special sauce, small salad and boatload of fries it is a real bargain! It's a ton of food (especially if you aren't bashful with the fries) that remarkably leaves you feeling full in a good way.  The meal also came with a huge Portuguese-style roll that I didn't eat until the next day at breakfast.The chicken was excellent - wings and legs were perfect, though the breast a little dry. The "spicy" sauce was a perfect touch, more an addition of flavor and moisture and a gentle hint of spice. It was a perfect dipping sauce for the fries at the end. The fries themselves were outstanding - seasoned to perfection with a hint of aromatic sweetness that seemed like celery. Yum!
Yummy chicken! Really good food. I have nothing bad to say about their food. I loved it. I would only say, at least have one person behind the counter, serving food, that speaks english! I don't eat beef and couldn't get anyone there to tell me if the poutine broth had beef in it. It was hell for those few minutes i went back and forth with them. I understand you are in Montreal, and you mainly speak french here, but how can you ignore the fact that it is a big tourism city. And, the international language happens to be english. I wish I could say I was the only one it happened to. It happened to another person as I was paying. Any who. If you eat everything and don't care to find out what else could be in their food outside of chicken, it's a great place. Food is good.
Nothing to add except to say I love this chicken so much. With rice, the portions are huge so if you're interested in chicken, opt out of the rice. The 1/2 chicken dinner was too much for my SO and I to finish, but worth every second of the walk over and the line
So I was expecting quite a lot from all the positive reviews I have heard about this place. Finally managed to get here on a quiet Thurs night where we didn't have to wait in line but most tables were still full. I opted for the 1/4 chicken breast and my boyfriend got the 1/2 chicken both with spicy sauce, we also got 2 drinks and 6 custard tarts and it came to about $27 which is reasonable. I was expecting a lot from the chicken and it wasn't up to what I expected as I make Portuguese chicken at home and I have eaten it in Portugal and it doesn't really compare and was a little dry. You also get salad and a lot of chips with it, dip the chips in the spicy sauce to make them taste better. Overall, it is a lot of food so a couple could easily get a half chicken and that would be enough. The Custard tarts were probably the best thing but you don't get any free with your meal anymore but they are still worth a try.Overall, worth a visit for quantity but far from the best chicken I have ever eaten and definitely not worth waiting for a long time in line.
I guess it's not Romados, it's me. My friends dragged me to Romados on a whim, because the day was so beautiful. I wasn't familiar with the place before, and neither was I familiar with Portuguese cuisine, so I didn't know what to expect. I thought this would be a full-blown restaurant with all sorts of Portuguese specialties. This is more a hole-in-the-wall sorta place: you order at one small counter after waiting in line, and choose from maybe 6 different meal options written above the counter. The Menu is fairly small and as the "Rotisserie" part of the name would suggest, consists mainly of chicken. I usually don't go out to eat chicken and ordered a pork escalope sandwich and a custard bun. Judging from all the reviews before me, I guess this is where I made a faux-pas. The sandwich was good. No more, no less. The bread was fluffy and bland, the escalopes a bit overcooked, what really bound everything together was the fat. Full-on fat, everywhere. The fries certainly benefit from all that fatty goodness and the next time I stop at Romados I'll gladly order a side of fries: they are well-seasoned and delicious and I promptly finished my friend's portion. The pastry stand is gorgeous to look at but nothing is named, and I always feel a fool trying to describe what I want. What is Portuguese? What isn't? I'm looking for something authentic here! My custard bun was good as well, with a hint of artificial processing in the custard's taste.  The prices are so low I'll probably be back a couple more times and see what exactly it is I seem to be missing out on.
Famous Portuguese chicken done right.  The spices and sauce give the chicken a distinctive flavor and the fries are also delicious.  There's also some interesting (international) bottled beverages to choose from (whether cola or juices).  This place can get busy and often has a line but I think it's worth it for the rich flavorful chicken for a cheap and quick meal.
THE BEST CHICKEN I HAVE EVER TASTED!!!If I were on death row, this would be my last meal request...The fries are amazingly good, the salad is tasty and the chicken is delectable! Fall off the bone, perfectly spiced with some form of piri-piri sauce, it may be very salty, but totally worth it...!!!Prepared fresh, you see the chickens preparing, cooking, waiting, and being cut and served to you. There is no guess work as to where your food comes from or what is being done to it!!!Extremely affordable, quick service (but be prepared to wait around 15 minutes anyways...there are always people!) I wish they had more tables so we could enjoy this at a more leisurely pace. If you get a spot, be kind and don't dilly-dally, there are people who are waiting to eat!!!Excellent custard tarts (pasteis de nata) and I;m sure everything else is great as well.I will never go to another Portuguese chicken place so long as Romados is around...
Atmosphere, Service, Food: What you need to know.Atmosphere: Ramados is a Portuguese, charcoal grill chicken place. No-nonesence set-up - it's made to serve people one thing: hot, juicy, fresh of the charcoal grill chicken! Very popular among the local community (and beyond) - it's often busy so don't expect to go in and get a table for two - there's barely 6-7 places you may sit.  Think the "Soup-Nazi" restaurant from Seinfeld fame.  You walk in - wait in line (moves quickly), order your chicken and GO!Service:  The people that work there - Portuguese - are very friendly and best of all know what they are doing.Food:  Ah the food.  There are plenty of Portuguese style grill restaurants in Montreal - but Ramados seems to have built a cult following due to the consistency with which they deliver the goods.  I've been to Ramados well over half a dozen times - and each time the meal is a good as the previous - not many restaurants can boast such a quality.  They have a very limited menu - mainly consisting of grilled Chicken and Pork, but if you're going there - you're definitely going for the Chicken.  They also have a glass display full of home made sausages, cheeses, and desserts!best of all? they are VERY generous! You'll pay your money, eat, and walk-out thinking that it was the best thing you've done all week.  The Fries are to die for.So good you just may end up going again, the next day!
Not much to add about this place which has not already been said, I had my first chicken from here when I lived on DeBullion over 15 years ago, at the time it was more of a grocery store but they made the chicken to go (you had to call to order for same day, or wait at least 45 min to an hour), now it is more of a take out food and bakery/deli.  Their chicken is very good with a smoky flavor and is home seasoned a la Portuguese, the fries are very good and try the grilled sardines, which are also very tasty.  The price is so affordable it is a must for students, and a score no matter what.  Hopefully they will keep making it as there seems to be a new controversy about the smoke emanating from places like this and the neighboring residence are complaining.enjoy while you can this could be the end of an era.....to be continued
Another must-visit on a trip to Montreal. This chicken is absolutely fantastic. The place is small with tables kind of crammed together. Get the chicken and eat it in the park a block away. I am not overly crazy about the enormous serving of fries dumped all over the chicken, but after awhile, they do grow on you.
I love Romados.  Have for many a year.  Until 2010 their "quarter chicken" trio (with fries and salad) was really 4 or 5 pieces of totally awesome chicken covered in spicy delicious portugese flavah.  So deliciously yummy.Recently they underwent some renovations, which somehow has made their chicken slightly more dry, and the management may have changed, so their formally uber-generous portions have been reduced to more standard fare sizes.  Still delicious though, and hands down my go-to fave for rotisserie/bbq chicken in MTL.
Wow!! The chicken is sooo good!!The fries have this special spice which makes it really good.Get the hot sauce on you chicken and dip your fries in it. This is food porn!!
Not as impressive as the lines would have you believe, but it's ridiculously cheap and huge (at least, the amount of fries are)! Hubby and got the half chicken platter to share - half a chicken, small salad, and an insane amount of fries (greasy, heavy, soggy) on top. I like that they give you a little tart to have as dessert! We also purchased a portuguese egg tart which was creamy and sweet and delightful. NOT someplace I'd recommend to go as a tourist as it's more of a grocery store/deli with only 2 tables, but it's good food.
I am so thankful that we found Romados on yelp!  Yelp to the rescue, yet again!  The chicken is fall of the bone tender and has just the right bit of smokiness.  The Portuguese egg tarts are amazingly good and they carry Five Alive in cans!  Sweet!
finally I went to Romados with my friend who were visiting Montreal from Toronto."It's really famous and really good." this is what I told him.we really like the huge amount of frites and delicious chicken and the salad.I would love to visit again, when it's not crowded!
So good! This is the best rotisserie chicken I ever had. So so so much better than swiss chalet or KFC or Popeyes. And it's pretty cheap. You can smell the good chicken even from far away. Strongly suggest going there.
Saw this place on yelp and on a cooking Chanel so I decided to try it. I got the 1/4 of chicken with fries and it came with this hot sauce. The mountain of fries were so tasty ( specially at the end covered in sauce and that's if you get to that ). I'm pretty sure there are some onions with the fries seasoning....yum. Now the chicken, it was so full of flavor you could really tell this was no ordinary rotisserie chicken. I would definitely recommend this place. The portions are huge and it was only 8$. I give this place a 4 star because  sitting there was really uncomfortable and if you take it to go and wait to long it's not the same so eat it fresh you won't be disappointed.
So. Mindblowingly. Good. I don't even like chicken and I'd eat Ramados every single day for the rest of my life if I could. WHAT ARE THEY DOING to this meat?? What is that miraculous basting mixture being slathered over these rotating birds?? Why, after all of this time, am I still craving Ramados??! The fries are whatever, but the chicken - ohmydearlawdinheaven, the CHICKEN! Seriously, it's so good that when a couple of my friends were debating whether to move from Montreal to Korea, Ramados weighed heavily on their decision. No joke. It's that freaking phantasmagorical. Don't walk, don't wait, just go - GO to Ramados. And thank the poultry gods for making such a deliciously greasy bird.
We ate here 3 times during our 6-day visit, and for good reason! The chicken sandwich is amazing. The answer to "Spicy?" is a clear & resounding "YES." The fries are ridiculously good; even the salad was delicious! Don't be put off by the seemingly long line--it moves fast and is well worth the wait.In my opinion, this was the best value in Montreal.
Oh yum. Bonjour to the best chicken I've ever eaten. Lately, I'm just so bored with chicken. It's like the white bread of meat. boring. overdone. everywhere. Kind of like how my vagina used to be before I quit whoring. And then I met Romados. The shop is on the edge of a sweet little neighborhood. Parking is plentiful or you can easily ride your bike here. Great bike lanes all the way down Rachel. Ordering was funny. For me. Not for my mom who fumbled her way through that only written in French menu. She tried to order by the price. I'm laughing now only because it was so damn cute. I love my mom, even moreso when she tries to speak French with her sweet southern twang. The chicken is moist. Juicy. Delicious. Spicy. Just like something else I know. It's kind of indescribably good. Really. It comes with a MOUND of french fries, so you're better off just ordering a whole chicken platter. Split it with someone and you have a delicious, filling meal for under $15. Order it spicy. Eat it there, although the space is a bit uncomfortable. I just cannot imagine it would be as good later on.
I went twice in two days with my wife, once for dinner and once for lunch. On both occasions we shared the 1/2 chicken combo, which was filling for the two of us. The chicken was a little dry when we went for dinner but still enjoyable. Great value and great taste.
Youri's comment (below) sold me on this place so I decided to check out the "Best Portugese Chicken" west of Portugal.I walked with two other friends and was surprised to see that it was more of the take-out style feel with only minimal number of tables to really sit down.  Fine by me because the moment I stepped in, I was captivated by the aura of chicken grilled over the fire.  Amazing.I ordered the 1/2 chicken and this was definitely more than enough.  Despite the line, the service was really fast once I placed the order.  The woman behind the counter kept piling on the amount of fries while having a conversation, a good sign already.I had this with the spicy sauce - wasn't really that spicy to be honest, but definitely had a small bite to its flavour. The chicken though was amazing.  It was succulent, it was juicy and it was delicious.  Too bad I'm leaving for Montreal tonight but if I were to come back to Montreal, I would definitely drop by for some chicken at Romados.Til next time.
one of my favorite bbq chicken place in montreal...i actually dreamt of it when i lived in LA! Stay away from the fries ...they are so awesome you can't just eat a few!!!Romados for me is to chicken what Shwatzes is to smoke meat!!!
1 word: delicious!!! The portions are just right & the prices are even better. My bf picked this lil Old Montreal gem & I'm glad he did. He had the 1/2 chicken & I had the 1/4 leg. We had 2 sauce options - he chose spicy & I chose sweet. Amazing!!! Each option came with fries (the sauce was added to that as well) and salad. Both our meal with 2 sparkling pineapple drinks came to a whopping $25!!!!!! I'm rounding up by the way. This place is a MUST when in Old Montreal. Little hole in the wall but absolutely delicious food. Next time we may try the pastries.
Good priced, not too sure what the hype is about the chicken, it didn't taste out of the world to me. Definitely seems healthier than other options, doesn't leave a greasy feeling in your mouth.
Really nice quality chicken.  Mountain of fries.  Tiny but delicious salad. Big old roll. $8.  You can feed your family very affordably here!Definitely give this place a try.I would say that the flavour of their chicken varies but is very nice and clean.  Toooo many fries but if you are into that go for it. I want to try their baked goods soon.Recommended. Try maybe to call ahead- they have a separate line for those who have pre-ordered.  Might be a way to avoid the lines!
Not sure how we found out about this place, but I am definitely glad that we did! It was absolutely amazing and worth the trek. For $10, you get 1/2 portuguese bbq chicken, a salad, rice, a mountain of french fries and a dinner roll. Definitely enough food for two hungry tummies! We're not the spicy food type, so when she asked if we wanted it spicy we were quick to say no! I kid you not, she gave us a look as if we were weenies :[ so we hesitantly changed our minds and asked for it spicy. Let me tell you that sauce is phenomenal, it would not have been the same without it! Its vinegary and sweet with just enough kick. By the end of the meal, we were soaking up the spicy sauce with our fries just to make sure we didn't waste a drop of it. The fries are delicious on their own. just the right seasoning.Such a great deal for a great amount of delicious chicken and fries heaven! I wish they had a place like this in LA. I must warn you though, its a small corner establishment. Not much room to sit and eat. So do figure out other places you can park it and enjoy your meal!
i dont get why people said its good...its terrible...very plain, super dry, barely enough dip stuff...and the salad? what a joke...what a complete waste of money, more waste of a chicken actually...the worst chicken ive had in my entire life...joke u not, in all seriousness...i was so pissed...anyway, ull find out urself when u go there if u do
I am a BBQ fanatic (smoked stuff) and love anything on the grill, too.  I just got back from eating Romados' chicken.  I ordered a half-chicken platter that came with fries and salad.  The first words out of my mouth when I smelled the chicken were literally, "holy cow!"After I parked my car half a block away from this gem on the corner, I knew what I was getting myself into.  I immediately smelled the charcoal!  And after walking inside the establishment, heaven.  The chickens are spatchcocked and are rotating as they are cooking over the charcoal.  I've never seen that type of roasting/grilling setup in my life, especially at a restaurant.So, there I was with chicken-in-hand and about 1/2 lb. of fries!  The woman at the counter (cashier) then gave me a piece of freshly-baked Portuguese bread and a small tart.  This was free.The dude that took my order was a bit rude.  I guess that happens when I don't speak French?  But other than that, no complaints.  This place rocks.
I found this place here on Yelp and it did not disappoint.  I was a little confused at first because I didn't realize this place was not a typical sit down style restaurant.  I came with a group of 4 people and we had to split up in two's to eat.  If we would have know in advance, we would have planned it different.  Nonetheless, the chicken was delicious.  The meat just fell off the bone and it had the just right kind of spiciness to it.  It was definitely some of the best barbecue chicken I've ever had.  The sauce on the chicken made the fries that come with it much better too.  They were just sitting in the juices and the sauce adding flavor the perfectly done fries.  The price was pretty reasonable as well.If I lived here, I would definitely visit this place often.
I am blessed to be near the best Portugeuse and Azorean food one can find, but this experience has not been found in the 02116 surrounding area yet!You go here for the chicken and the chicken, and the chicken....and the sauce on the chicken.  Oh, and those fabulous petite custard pies that they throw in your bag!  Opens up for Lunch at 11.30 a.m.We got a whole chicken, rice, fries, salad and drinks for about $20 CAD.  Picnic over in Mt. Royal= Life is good!I will be looking forward to going here again le prochain temps je serai en Montreal!
This place has bbq chicken coming out the friggin walls with awesome fries straight out of heaven. Portuguese grill with pastries, bread and attitude. Chop chop!
deliciouse, succulent, moist, tender, spicy, flavorfulRamados chix is amazing bursting with flavor and soul.i can't wait to experience it in Montreal at the real place!awesome awesome grub
Three words for this place: grub as feeze! I ate here only once on my very first visit to Montreal, and I still think about my meal that day and salivate just a 'lil.I saw a few different establishments advertising "Portuguese Rotisserie Chicken" in Montreal, and decided that I would do some Yelping to determine the best location to ingest aforementioned chicken (which was new to my quarter-Portuguese heritage self -- is this a Canadian thing?!). Yelpers did not fail me -- my two-piece chicken meal with fries and side salad was tha bizness! I was even able to procure a grape Fanta as my beverage -- what?!Seating is indeed a problem though -- I got my meal to-go and walked the block-and-a-half up to the small Parq des Ameriques, and consumed this meal-from-the-Gods out of the styrofoam box on a park bench. And when they ask "Spicy?" Say yes. Or, sorry -- "Oui!" Or "sim!"
I love the fries, and the sauce on the chicken was great. The juiciness of the chicken was very good, but couldn't match the splendidity of the sauce. I wouldn't say it's a be-all-end-all or can't miss, but it's definitely a good stop - very popular with locals. The baked items seemed doable too. I liked how casual this place was, how your order from the cooks, who stand in front of the kitchen. I didn't see many take-out joints in my time in Montreal, this was a good one. Dig it.
BELIEVE THE HYPE!The fabled line is totally worth it. My guy and I will spend 12 bucks splitting a whole chicken (spicy, duh) for dinner and I'm seriously knawing the marrow out of the bones and eating the spinal cord at the end of the meal, it's soooo good.WARNING: If I eat the potatoes and the bird at once I go into a serious chicken coma so I advise only a side of salad if you actually want to do something with your day.
We trudged all around the Plateau looking for a lunch spot on the day after New Year's Day, but the city's restaurant owners must have still be sleeping off their hangovers (?) because nothing was open. Nothing except Romados, of course.The lineup was huge, but the food was worth the wait. The chicken hadn't met the dry fate of so many other chickens before it (thank god). It was spicy and moist and of course greasy, but in a good way. The portion was huge. It came with a heap of fries (crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside) and a few bites of salad. I ate so much I didn't eat dinner that night, and I still didn't finish my plate.There aren't many spots to sit, but in better weather it's not a problem to find someplace outside nearby.
Went tonight for first time it was amazing i got half chicken combo amazing bun great fries and best chicken ever and great price 7.99 the you get salad will go again asap
It is good, the line is long (call ahead) and it is cheap! Fries are sweet, did not see any rice maybe it was under the pounds of fries! I am not sure I would do the line again unless I was short on cash. More of a value than a virtue.
Great chicken and fries. (deserts are good as well!)  Huge portions - low price. What else could you want?
The line is long, but the wait is worth it.This rotisserie chicken is so juicy and greasy. Yum. I got the combo with fries, rice, and salad, but you can ask for the combo any way you like (just salad and rice, etc). Sauce is excellent (perfect level of spiciness). There is also a bakery here and some authentic Brazillian products, but I didn't have any more room in my belly after I consumed half a chicken. But if you go, you gotta wash it all down with a bottle of Guarana.Tips: Figure out what you want before you get in line. There are people waiting.
Portuguese Bakery & Chicken shack that also sells local beer? WHAT? This place is  on Rachel E in a nice, leafy part of the plateau and yet one can fill one's stomach up to the brim for under $20. Not just with moist and lip-smackingly salty Frango e Batata along with a cold Belle Guele Pilsner, but also still-warm, delicate pastel de nata just out of the oven;  gooey and creamy on the inside and just barely crunchy with a kiss of caramelized powdered sugar on top giving the custard a crunch almost akin to a Crème Brûlée...I'm almost drooling from the memory alone..
What Montreal is all about: you bike, far, up in these neighborhoods where everything may look so common to you and then you end up spotting the place that will make your day. So simple and so unique.Rotisserie Romados will surprise you. Make sure you get the chicken. A "1/2" will surely fit two starving stomachs and get a good load of spicy sauce. You may ask for breasts or thighs. And by the way, yelpers perhaps do not highlight it enough but the fries are excellent: crunchy and tasting like potatoes. Drinks wise, I recommend the imported Guarana soda and the Portuguese bottled orange soda. But Romados is also a pastry and will serve you creamy egg-tart and cappuccinos (or might be as well-off going to Neve right in front of it).  Furthermore, given quality and quantity, prices are unbeatable. 1/2 Chicken + 2 sodas + Dessert = $15. Bread comes free.PS Does NOT accept Credit cards but Debit ones.
First thing you need to do IF you decide to go by this place. Call and put in the order or you will be waiting in line drooling for 15-30 minutes.My GF and I order 1/2 of poulet combo. It came with Fries and Salad. The bill was around 10 bucks or so. The bird was bar b q really well. They give you a big portion. We try not to order big meal because we want to go to as many places as we can when we were in MTL. We were in Montreal for 3 days we ate here twice and it was well worth it.Remember look up the # and call first before you go. Check out the menu online. Or take a bib with you. :-)
Best portuguese chicken in Montreal. The sauce is just SO GOOD. It's worth it to take it spicy. There is always a long line up, but since they renovated, it's a lot faster and they added seats too. Definitely a place to try if you're visiting the city!
Best chicken ever. Great fries. Even the buns are rich in bunly goodness.Not much space to eat, so plan on taking it home or heading to a nearby park to chow down.
Best Chicken in Montreal! and in the whole world?I love this place: huge portions, amazing fries, delicious flavourful chicken, all that for a very cheap price. It's always packed, which is a good sign! A downside is that it'll be hard to find a seat, but you can walk to Mont Royal park and eat there if you have the patience!And if you order a meal deal at the weekend until 2pm, there's bread and a pastry included... if you can eat them! I always make sure I save space for dessert!Go, you won't be disappointed!
Does live up to the hype, but certainly does not stand out on its own in this neighborhood.Chicken was great (as has been heavily stated)! But the breast was a little dry.  Also wasn't a fan of the fact that the spicy chicken is a regular chicken with chili oil added after the fact.  Portugalia (down the street at the intersection of Rachel and Clark) puts the chili oil, etc. on while they grill the chicken.  Fries are ok, but both the chicken and the fries seemed to be much better with the added chili oil.Bread was great and $10 for 1/2 a chicken, salad, and a ton of fries was more than enough for 2 people.  Food was extremely quick, despite other reviews that had a long wait.Not much place to sit and eat, and no drinking alcohol in the restaurant.All in all, a fantastic place to grab great Portuguese chicken and fries (maybe some beer) to take home.  But if you want equal quality chicken with crispier fries and the ability to sit and enjoy the food with a beer and a few olives, give Portugalia a try, you won't be disappointed.
Yelp Montreal led us here to see what all the 5 star reviews was all about..From my analysis of devouring chicken, my conclusion comes down to some points about Romados... ::PROS::Cheap for a half chicken ($7.5ish)HUGE ass portionsFamily ran, no frills what you see is what you get type of spot..The chicken breast was pretty tastyTONS of fries just flopped over blanketing the chickenSalad as a healthy garnish along with their vinegar dressingDid I say a LOAD of fries?Spicy oil based hot sauce You walk out full, and not hungryThey give you a huge bread to chase with the chickenBakery, for the dessert lovers afterwardsxx-CONS-XXA little dry on the half chicken I orderedFries were just ok. It was seasoned but not that good.The wings were not SO tasty. It kinda lost some of the OoompH in taste. I would definitely come back and try it again. A good spot to just munch down on some rotisserie chicken. Originally I wanted to give this spot a 3.5* stars, but the pros out weight the cons..
Simply put, this is probably the best BBQ chicken in Montreal. Their fries and rolls are also really good.It can get a little busy at times, though, so you should probably be prepared to wait in line for 10-15 minutes. Alternatively, call ahead so that your order is read in advance.
We screwed this dinner up twice.  Here are some essential tips so you don't also:1) Go no later than 630.  The line explodes after that and you may not get chicken.2) Two people should get a whole chicken meal to share.  Don't fool yourself thinking you'll only eat a quarter.  This chicken is the crack of the North.3) When they ask "spicy?" say yes.  The sauce gets sopped up by the seasoned fries.4) Feel free to use US dollars.  We got 1-to-1.Miss this place at your own risk.
Chicken with French fries - THREE OUT OF FIVE. The chicken was super salty, crammed into a styrofoam box also containing a mountain of french fries. This was one of the times that quantity is not better than quality. I honestly think the rotisserie chicken at your local grocery store is better. Egg Tarts - FIVE OUT OF FIVE. These are so good ... they are an egg-tarte with a pudding consistency and absolutely melt in your mouth.
I don't know if I can add anything new that hasn't already been said, but basically all you need to know about Romados is that you're going to get delicious, rotisserie chicken seasoned to perfection with a side of equally tasty salt & pepper fries and you're gonna walk out the door with a feeling of both glee and guilt - wait, did they undercharge me? How did I get so much food for less than $10? But those worries will quickly melt away as you take your first bite of chicken.Needless to say I'll be returning, and if I'm in a rush I'll take advantage of the shorter line up for those who have called their orders in ahead. And yes, go for the spicy sauce. Yummmmm.
This place is pretty much unreal! You walk in, actually, before you even walk in, you can smell the barbeque down the street. You can fully see what the cooks are doing. You can see the food roasting over the open pit. Incredible eats. The portions are more than enough to fill an average person up. I ordered half a chicken, with salade and frites. It was bursting out of the take out container. AND it the meal comes with a homemade bun.Will definitely need to return to this place for another feed.
I'm a picky bastard when it comes to most things, but the chicken here is a stroke of absolute genius!To wait for 20 minutes in the Saturday lineup that extends out the door onto the corner of Rachel and De Bullion would ordinarily be an inconvenience for most people, but it's more of a calming pleasure as the smell of rotisserie roasting chicken over a charcoal fire is sure to illuminate the senses with hungry delight.A quarter chicken with a veritable mountain of fries and nice bit of salad will run you a minuscule 7 dollars and could very well feed a family of 4, though I personally like to divide it into 2 meals depending on my level of hunger. Beyond its ridiculously tasty chicken, Ramado's is also a full fledged Portuguese bakery which offers some of the finest custard tarts in the city and really nice Portuguese buns which they will include as a compliment to the chicken meal if you ask nicely. Make sure to lather that chicken and fries in their delicious homemade rotisserie sauce because it is such a flavourful addition to an already superb meal. You won't find better value anywhere else in Montreal and dare I say, in the entire country for the simple reason that no other restaurant could survive offering such incredible value. This is a must go to restaurant to anyone visiting or living in Montreal.
One of Montreal's finest rotisseries. Their secret family recipe is divine. And it's so cheap. Should you want to bring home a family meal, grab a chicken or porc sandwich with fries, or taste some traditional Portuguese pastries, Romados is the place to go. Just be aware that you may have to brave a serious lineup.
Best chicken I've ever had. EVER. It's also an incredible value. It's fairly priced and more than anyone can eat. I wish I lived in Montreal just so I could eat here daily.
My heart (and stomach) is wavering: who has the better chicken in town? Romados or Coco Rico?Romados' chicken is a bit smoky and has different layers of flavor (tangy. spicy) I'm literally biting and chewing on all the bones. Fries are delicious with the spicy sauce...And do they serve them by the bucket or something?Coco Rico's chicken is a different specie. Bigger, juicy, and meat falls off the bone. It's less flavorful in terms of spices but it's so tasty. The potatoes melt in your mouth.Finish off with a Portuguese egg tart :)Romado's is better... No Coco Rico is.... No Romados... No Coco Rico... you get the picture!
Yum - definitely the tastiest chicken I've eaten in North America - even without the chili sauce!The chips were tasty, I don't know what they added to it but it was awesome!  Also came with a dessert, but I much preferred the portugese tart I bought =)If you can't read french and are wondering why there are 2 prices for a 1/4 chicken it relates to the part of the chicken you get.  I had a 1/2 chicken and definitely recommend getting the thigh....mmmm
I felt like I was joining a club. There are rules and regulations, but luckily my brother knew them. You get in the long line, you scope for hints that people are leaving one of the three tables, you figure out what you're ordering in advance to getting to the counter, you get it spicy. It's not really much of a task to figure out what to order; besides the baked goods at another counter all they do is chicken. And my, they do it well. I ordered the quarter chicken meal: chicken, salad, rice and French fries. The chicken was so tender, so fall-off-the-bones, I didn't want to use any cutlery. Spicy wasn't spicy, just spiced and just right. I didn't get the rice, still not sure whose fault that is. The salad was unnecessary. A lot of it just got soggy and cooked beneath the chicken. The fries on the other hand were great. A bit over-peppered at times, but still rank A. The portion was HUGE. $6.99 for a Styrofoam meal box. And then they give you a bun at the cash register too! I guess it's like them giving you a business card to try out their bakery. I say take the plunge, the roll was a nice addition and all the treats on display looked really good. Four stars for the fries (I'm disregarding the other sides), five stars for that chicken. So I'm rounding up. Oh, that chicken. If you can get past the dozens on rotating chickens, the black gloves the intense looking men use as they wield their meat cleavers and that long line then go.  Join the club.
My family and I decided to try this restaurant after reading various Yelp accounts. First, this is part bakery and part takeout joint. The staff is helpful to those of us who do not speak French. The chicken is quite good. Not the best I have ever had, but very good. They were out of rice, so I had fries. They were good with pepper on them just like I prefer. There were so many that I could not finish half of them. It came with a small salad buried under the fries.The best thing, of course, is the price. Drinks and three meals came in under $30.00. Quite a break from expensive Montreal!
So far, this place has 14 five-star reviews, and I'm not going to disagree. This place is seriously as good as it gets.Granted, I don't have much experience with portuguese chicken, but the chicken I had was ridiculously delicious. Very tender and juicy with such great and explosive flavor. The fries were well-seasoned and delicious; the rice was a great addition to balance out the flavorful chicken and sop up the tasty leftover juices; and the salad is nice to give you the impression that you might be eating something healthy. Just thinking about eating this is making me salivate.Anyway, the way it works is you stand in line, order half a chicken (I guess you could also order other stuff, but why would you?), pay for it, then split with a friend and enjoy. Inexpensive, delicious, and filling. I don't know what more you could ask for.
Even an ever-mooching girlfriend couldn't help me finish the cavernous bed of fries on which my amazingly spicy pork lay, and all that for a mere 8 bucks! Go during off-hours when it's quick.
I got really lost looking for this place! Directionally challenged I know. But my excuse is that I'm an international traveler in your fine city!Anyway, I was starving and was determined to find this joint after reading all these great reviews. I had the 1/4 chicken leg combo, which was translated to me by a really nice couple (the menu is in French FYI). I watched in amazement as the cook chopped up the meat and piled it with a TON of fries!!! The meal could easily feed a family of four! It also comes with rice and a salad. But honestly you can't see what's underneath the giant pile of fries!The chicken had a lovely taste to it. The spicy sauce wasn't as spicy as I'd like it to be. And everything was a teensy bit too salty. If I had a friend to share it with, it would have been more manageable!  All in all a great neighborhood restaurant. Seems to be hugely popular with the locals. The line was almost out the door!
There is nothing I can say of this place that hasn't already been said.Amazing chicken and amazing fries.
During my week-long vacation in Montreal, I had a sushi buffet, an expensive French dinner and large amounts of poutine. Yet, the meal I would have again in a heartbeat, the meal that highlighted my stay, resides in this amazing and humble establishment. For a light lunch, my parents and I split a half a chicken and fries. The chicken was perfectly cooked: mind-blowingly flavorful, juicy and enveloped in the crispiest, tastiest skin. Also, the chicken had the perfect level of spiciness, whetting the appetite with each bite. On top of this, the fries were a mountain of pillowy potatoes which I would say rivals if not tops Pommes Frites in New York. Once you put one of these babies in your mouth, you can forget about that diet you've been trying to keep because you will not be able to control yourself! I have to stop now because I'm literally salivating too much. Rotisserie Romados is definitely worth it in every sense of the word!
This restaurant BURNT DOWN recently (January)... I was devastated! They will reopen but didn't announce when...
Always a line so call ahead and save yourself some time.The chicken here is legendary, it's like a flavor grenade went off in your mouth. Crispy skin, juicy, juicy chicken and nice spice. I can eat and I usually split a half chicken meal with my partner. It's a half chicken with a salad and a boatload of fries on top. Get the spicy sauce- it's not super spicy but it's very flavorful. Oh, and grab an egg tart for dessert.You must try it!
Wow. I've never seen reviews like this! And I believe they are deserved. You can eat yourself into yummy obesity for only 10$ a day!
Ever since the renovations, the food has changed. The chickens are tiny and not cooked the same way. Hence don't taste the same at all. Neither do their fries. The prices have gone up significantly as well. Very disapointing.There are no more reasons to go out of your way to go to this place any longer. There are better portuguese chicken places in Montreal.---------------------------------------------------Located close to Mount-Royal park, this place is a Montreal classic.  If you're looking for take out,  finger- licking good rotisserie chicken with great salt & pepper fries at a decent price ...Romados is THE place. They also have ribs and other tasty specialties but the chicken is always a winner.  If you're in a rush, you'll want to call and place your order ahead of time. The line up is usually quite long on the weekends. As a native Montrealer, nothing says Summer in Montreal like sitting in the park at the base of the mountain, listening to the drums, people watching and pigging out on Romados chicken with a bottle of passion fruit soft drink.
For 9 $ I had half chicken, salad, rice and an insane amount of fries. It's a good option for not too much money
Very good price for quality , although the dish is not beautiful and french fries look messy but it IS delicious. Yummy.
Best chicken in Montreal and one of the best ever in my life. Get prepared for a serious que though.
My first meal in Montreal and this place didn't disappoint.  The address on the door says 123, there isn't another place around but I was a little confused. The chicken meal was huge and I definitely couldn't finish all of the food I had ordered with the half chicken meal. The chicken itself was delicious, particularly the skin and the sauce that came with it. The chicken didn't ruin chicken for me, as there were some pieces that were far less moist than others, but overall, it was a delicious piece of chicken, perfectly complimented by the soft but flavorful french fries.
The most amazing fries I have ever tasted, and a huge serving for $3.  Sooo good.
The french fries are SO amazing! Seriously one of my favorite fries I've ever had and they give so much! BF got the 1/4 chicken, which he also was raving about. The line was a little long on a Saturday around lunch time and there was no where to sit, but it was totally worth it. BTW - some egg pastry custard thing looked good, but was kind of gross - and I LOVE dessert.
Just went back last week to get some crazy-man-on-chicken love. The recent shout-out on Anthony Bourdain's the Layover Montreal episode was well deserved, but will likely make it harder to get a seat going forward. Damn.
Very very good chicken! However it doesn't touch Dinos in LA.. They should serve it with tortillas rather then bread.
This place serves crack -- in the form of rotisserie chicken and french fries. This is easily the best combo of the two that you can get on Planet Earth. No joke.
The chicken comes in huge proportion compared to the price! please do check it out with an empty stomach.
The best Portuguese chicken in town, period.If you go during the week, try out the chicken sandwich, it's pretty fantastic but not available on the weekend. :(
This place is amazing, I used to go all the time during my days at McGill. The must have menu item is of course the rotisserie chicken (actually grilled over charcoal) doesn't get any better than this, best I've had or probably will have. Comes in many forms, if its only one or two of you go for the plates (quarter chicken, breast or leg, or half chicken, mountain of fries and small salad, rices occasionally available.) Chicken is perfectly cooked, nice and juicy and well seasoned. You have a choice of spicy sauce or mild, word to the wise, go with the spicy (it's not spicy at all actually). Fries are pretty good. Prices are even better. When I started going there it was $4.75 for a quarter chicken plate (enough food to feed a small family). Prices have gone up recently but still absurdly cheap.You should also know that chicken isn't the only thing Romados makes. It's also a bakery! I recommend the rice flour cupcakes/muffins. Awesome, nice and dense but with a fluffy texture.Highly, highly recommended to the Montréal native or visitor.
Guys relax... maybe in Montreal you have St Hubert and that is why you give this place 5 stars...  the chicken is good, ok, but that's it. We tried the calamari and it was suspiciously huge pieces and very salty... the sides are absolutely loaded, too much... so much it is kind of grotesque... So...  get two chickens for a party of 6-8 and then ask for the smallest side of salad and the smallest side of potatoes and that will be more than enough for all your party...
Love the fresh grilled chicken (and you have to adore the scene with a whole row of the little birds being flipped together over fire) but the egg tarts fell pretty flat.
Quite simply: Kick-ass Portuguese chickens.  Get the spicy Peri-peri sauce!  The fries are a tasty side dish.  Great value!Be prepared to wait in line, but it's worth it, and you can peruse the pastries behind the counter to buy some dessert or breakfast for the next day.Perfect for the first night in our vacation apartment, when we weren't ready to cook or go out to a nice restaurant yet.  Will return this summer!
Not necessarily a fancy restaurant, but one of the most memorable meals I've had in Montreal.  It's sometimes tough to find parking, and the line in the restaurant can be long, but the chicken was so tasty that it's worth the extra trouble.
This is pretty well THE BEST chicken place west of Portugal. Every minute you wait in line just build the anticipation until you finally get your platter from the nicest woman in the world (who always hooks you up with extra) and then that first bite... oh that first bite - it's the most satisfying feeling you've ever had. Oh, and what is usually good for two meals will only cost you about $8.00. Well worth the wait, but call in advance if you can't stand the lineups.
If you go to Romados don't wait for a fancy place but for excellent food. This is by far the best barbecued chicken place in Montreal. Saint-Hubert, Scores and other are great places for chicken but Romados takes it to a new level. If you can call before you arrive you will avoid the lineup and will get your chicken faster. The sizes of the portions are unreal and the complementary "pastel de nata" (Portuguese custard pie) and small bun make this meal a true Portuguese experience. I keep returning to Romados as the service is also amazing. A little trick: while they are serving you at the counter make sure you place heavy coins on the wooden tip box and your portion may even increase (ehehe) If you buy portions for parties don't be surprised if you pay for 6 chicken and they give you seven. Romados is the best charcoal Barbecue Chicken in Quebec!
We were visiting montreal for a couple of days, and stumbled upon this little rotisserie place. if you're traveling on a budget, this place is totally worth it! it's local, no fancy digs or anything like that, but the proportions are big. my friend and I split the 1/4 chicken, and it came with rice, french fries, salad, and to top it off, a bread roll. a cheap meal and so filling! the best rotisserie chicken I've ever had.
Overrated chicken. I got the one with spicy oil on it. Honestly I was underwhelmed. The portugese egg tart on the other hand was the BOMB, nice crispy skin and firm filling, so much better than Chinatown egg tarts. I give 5 stars for the pastel de nata, 3 for the chicken.
Why do I try other portugese chicken places?  I should always go here. Always.  PS - they close at 8pm, and may run out of chicken before then, so get there early.
Best food bargain on my trip to Montreal, thanks yelpers for the suggestion. For under $20 we got two half chicken combos and enough tasty chicken and fries to feed us for two meals. I generally don't eat rotisserie chicken skin, but this chicken had me eating everything but the bones. I liked their salt and pepper seasoned fries. I guess we were lucky, we only had to wait a few minutes to order, and got a seat at a table.
With a 1/2 pound of chicken in piri sauce that melted in my mouth, a light salad, and crispy, flavorful fries all for $6, I felt like I was walking out of a rotisserie in Lisbon. "Muito bom."
The line up is worth it.  This is tasty chicken!  Take out highly recommended.  Cheap.
This place totally rocks!  I got the 1/4 thigh combo, which was a huge portion of chicken, a salad, and an enormous amount of seasoned fries.  They pile on the fries OVER the chicken and salad-- the amount of fries is that much.  It also comes with a bread roll, which is very good-- soft and chewy on the inside, and goes great with the chicken.  As for the chicken itself, it was incredible.  Perfectly seasoned and crispy on the outside, and tender and juicy on the inside.  SO good.  PLUS, it's a really good deal.  You get ALL of that food for $5.99 CAD!I also got an egg tart, which is somewhat similar to the Chinese egg tarts.  Compared to the Chinese egg tarts, the filling in the Portuguese style is more creamy and sweet, rather than solid and gelatinous.Highly recommend this place and will be craving to go back.
Before choosing this place:  These is no real seating available for the hoardes of people who dine here, they only take cash, the chicken is good but not amazing, the fries are average but for the price (around $8.00) it's a good deal in Montreal.  If you are health conscious this is a NO GO place, it is for those who don't mind lots of grease.  The folks that work here are interested in moving the line along, which means the service was nuetral (Be aware also that they speak VERY limited english) but move the line along well.
Sometimes I get a major craving for this chicken, on a portuguese bun or with fries and the homemade hot sauce this little 3 foot women slathers on with a paintbrush. I lived next door to it for twelve months and she made me dinner 5 days a week. I will never forget that place.
Quite the experience. Expect a line. Worth the wait.
The only negative about this place are the lineups. I hate waiting for my food even if it is worth the wait.
This place is fantastic.  The menu is limited, but the chicken is tender and flavorful and you get far too much food for your money.  I got the 1/4 chicken which came with rice, fries as well as rolls.  I got my money's worth and then some.
The best value-for-your-money Portuguese place in Montreal. Great chicken and friendly service. A must-see.
Best Chicken ever!!
The chicken is amazing!  The pastel de nata is highly recommended as well.
this place is so good we went back twice in the row. The chicken was amazing and don't forget to get the custard tart. Skip the salad and just go for the whole chicken and small fries (enough for 3 people).
Yum and a great deal!!  Finger licking good chicken!  And give the Portuguese egg tart a try!  The super flaky crust with rich custard filling was delicious!
amazing portuguese-style slowed cooked (smoked) meats and fries. get there early for the specials, which sometimes include rabbit or lamb. and don't ignore the displays: baked goods are good, chorizo is incredible. there are a few places to sit and eat and no table service - only a takeout counter.
pretty tasty chicken and fries! they ran out of rice when i was there.  we also had a tart pastry i forgot which one, but it was pretty good ! overall a rather heavy meal.
Best deal in the plateau. Get the half or quarter chicken plate. The chicken is juicy and they fill your box to the top with fries. I swear the woman who serves you is a saint. Call ahead to avoid the line. Also if you go before two it comes with free dessert.
I'm basically copying my review of La Fabrique Arhoma. Location: In Place Valois, on Ontario Est... I drove so can't say what subway stop is close-by. Street parking is available but there's a lot of construction in the area so it's a sh*t show.The place: This space is much bigger than La Fabrique, with the bread section on one side and the rest of the goodies on the other. They also had cheeses and sandwiches. This is a pick-up joint so you can't sit down and eat your goodies.The goods: I first discovered Arhoma through Lufa, when I ordered a basic white loaf of bread. Holy crap, do these guys make good bread! The loaf has a great consistency and is super tasty. I like a hint of saltiness in my bread and this one totally delivered. A friend of mine swears by their baguettes - I haven't tried them but I'm confident that they rock. I stopped in last weekend because I needed a pick-me-up from walking around, hunting for street art all day. I decided to go for the pistachio chocolatine, which, by the way, is enormous. I guess I lucked out because when I started picking at it, it still had a hint of warmth to it, and the chocolate was all melty. The chocolatine was super, super moist and literally melted in my mouth. I mean, it was impossible not to have a mouthgasm while I ate this thing. Because it was so big, I ate half right away and saved the rest for later. I've also tried their chocolate lava cakes and it's equally delicious. What I like is that the chocolate is not too rich, so you can totally eat the whole thing in one sitting. I wouldn't share, if I were you. On this visit, I tried a brownie. It was incredibly chocolatey and dense - I ate half and saved the rest for later. Lastly, if you see the pistachio/rhubarb bread, go for it. It's amazing!Service: OK.Price point: Pretty good. You can get a great loaf of bread for under $4, the chocolatine and brownie were about $3 each. These guys are top notch in terms of using quality ingredients. Check it!
Very busy on weekends so while the bakery delivers great things the same can't be said of the watery lattes and over stressed staff.
Very cool place to get a sandwich and dessert. Grabbed some croissants and baguettes for the ride back to NY. Great cheese selection. Will be my regular stop now when in Montreal.
brunch on lucky weekday off. it seemed relaxing inside but there were actually few seats left. even Monday morning. waao!patisserie, coffee and service are simply awesome. i love their non-too-sweet style very much. decoration is pretty and there are lots home made products available as well. i should try their cheese next time.
- lovely outdoor seating during the summer- flaky delicious croissant -  roast beef sandwich
Just what we needed, two blocks from the apartment where we were staying.  Great coffees. Morning pastries....the 'apricotine' was exceptional, as was the 'croissant nature.'  We could eat here every day.  Walked out to an impromptu interlude when a young man sat at the plaza piano and played several songs.
If you're on your way to the botanical gardens, then stop by here quickly for some of the most delicious Croissants I've ever had for a nice energy boost. I found this place on yelp and was initially skeptical of the raving reviews, especially during the long walk from the Botanical Gardens down the street. But once I got here, I can tell quickly that the journey was well worth it! The bakery shop is separated into 3 parts: an outdoor seating area, an indoor cheese emporium, and an indoor bakery. While I may not be a cheese expert, the sweet scent of the baked French breads cannot be mistaken.I tried both the butter Croissants and the unique pistachio croissants and they were absolutely phenomenal (I preferred the butter croissant, but I'm a traditionalist). The staff were also very friendly and served some of the best coffee I've had as well (black, no sugar).Overall, this place was worth the walk and the exploration and a definite place to visit if you're around the area.Food: 5 starsPrice: 5 starsAmbiance: 4 starsService: 4 stars
Went there twice for breakfast on our visit to Montreal initial based on the recommendations from our AirBnB host. Very fresh pastries and outstanding coffee. The sandwiches looked appetizing as well, and co-located with the cafe is a small shop selling bread and cheese.
Their pistachio croissants are the best! Plus, their bakery attached to their fromagerie!
Tried the croissant today after reading here about how good it was and it was awesome.  It must not have been out of the oven that long because it was still warm making it even better!
Tasty breads and local cheeses.Add to that a terrace, coffee, pastries + hearty sandwiches and you have a winning combo of awesome..at least imho.Worth a visit, or 500.I really like cheese.
Very nice bakery/cafe with excellent sandwiches and pastries.  We enjoyed breakfast here--a croissant sandwich with eggs, brie and ham makes your average American cafe pale by comparison.   Bustling atmosphere but quiet.  Pistachio croissants, chocolate croissants are  superb.  Lots of other choices as well.... Even early on  a Saturday morning this place was busy--no wonder.  Service was friendly, efficient, and all staff spoke English.
Hochelaga was the original Huron place name for this beautiful island that we inhabit. Hochelaga is where it all started -- it's where it all began. Then a series of unfortunate events happen ... the warlike Iroquois killed most of the peace-loving Huron people. Then along came Jacques Cartier who built our home on Native's land. Then the limey English came and we all know what happened next. Je me souviens des plaines d'Abraham ôsti! The Americans were next. Notwithstanding the five hundred years of overdue back paid rent and tax we all owe to First Nations people for genocide, rape and displacement, the dictatorial regime of Maurice Duplessis, Anglo hegemony and oppression of the Québécois, FLQ kidnappings, bombs in Westmount Park trash cans, two referendums, the faltering loonie that was worth 67 cents USD, a pretty crazy ice storm and Celine Dion's Titanic song - not withstanding all that heavy heavy shit - times have been great and they are getting even better. Hochelaga represent! East side! ArHoMa is 100% legit. Everybody knows that Hochelaga-Maisonneuve is the best borough in this city with the best salt-of-the-earth people in this city and now my childhood hood has the best food as well! While contributing a tad bit to the process of gentrification in HoMa it makes up for it in sheer quality, taste and value for dollar. This is the best, allow me to stress that again, ArHoMa is seriously the best pâtisserie, boulangerie, café, bakery and fromagerie in Montréal hands down. Where else on God's green earth can you find the ingenious conceptualisation that is the pistachio chocolatine or pistachio croissant? This is a very very dangerous item of food. It is a thing of glory. The erotic, eclectic and eccentric interplay of sweet dark chocolate, perfectly buttery flakey croissant along with the nutty saltiness of the pistachio make for an elegant, deep and beauteous cacophony of intriguing flavour inside your mouth. These pastries are always flying off the shelves faster than they come out of the oven so it's good to go early. They do make them several times a day, I understand, so try and get yours piping hot out of the oven but if not it's still damn good. They also have excellent breads baking at multiple times during the day. Get yourself one or two of the cheeses from their extensive selection and go have a picnic by yourself or with a lover or friend. Be sure to enjoy the ginormous terrace and post-modern sculpture garden and benches of Place-Simon-Valois that they've got open to patrons and the public alike. This place is a thing of beauty. Enjoy yourself and bon appétit à tous !
Been to this Hochelaga gem a couple of times now. If I lived closer, I would be a regular. Their pistachio croissants are ridiculously good. Their baguettes are great too. I haven't tried their sandwiches, but they look tasty and seem like to be good value for the money. I had a pretty good coffee here, and the service was as friendly as it gets. If you're heading up to check out Value Village, do yourself a favor and swing by this place on the way home. You won't regret it.
Was here in July 2012.  I was a great neighborhood find.  Amazing freshly-made pastries...forget what you know about almond croissants and go for the pistachio - the best when fresh outta the oven.  The other side of the store is a gourmet market with fresh cheeses and such.  Good for breakfast and lunch or just a little caffeine.  I believe the closest subway stop is Joliette.  You will wish you had such a nice cafe in your own hood.
Bought their pecan/cranberry bread, it's really good. My sister bought their sourdough baguette, and she was pleased as well. She's quite the picky coffee/bread/food person, so I guess this was something to hear from her. I have to add she's an excellent cook/baker so I suppose the  pickiness  comes with that. Nice little square to sit & enjoy your coffee/pastry/croissant etc , go for a stroll in Ontario Village afterwards.
Chez Boris, I am a huge fan!!!  This small little cafe offers the freshest Russian doughnuts, great coffee (Kittel and 49th Parallel), and teas (PureTea).  I had a Pour Over coffee, which was made strong and smooth; organic cream was provided so you can pour to your heart's content.  The hubs had a Chai Latte - this was creamy, yummy, and made with the house's chai concentrate - it was lovely and had the perfect amount of spice!  We also shared their famous beignes, which comes in 3 different flavors: Sugar, Cinnamon/Sugar/Cloves, and Chocolate.  We opted for the Sugar and the Cinnamon/Sugar/Cloves - these donuts were made-to-order, super fresh, and super delicious!  The sugar one was simple, but my favorite was the Cinnamon/Sugar/Cloves, as it had the right amount of kick from the cloves and had a nice spice tint to it.  These were addicting, and I can see why most of the patrons ordered a big bowl of it while they worked!  Service was super sweet, friendly, and lovely, and the place has a nice comfortable vibe to it - slightly dark, but plenty of tables where you can plug-in, use their free wi-fi, and do some work/studying.  Lots of local art pieces on the wall, and I really liked their Super NES console holding the cafe's business cards :P  Definitely a place not to be missed! :D+fresh Russian donuts :D :D :D+makes own Chai concentrate :D+Chai Latte+friendly service! :D+free wi-fi+unisex bathroom
Chez Boris is a really cool coffee shop that has the added pro of having some of the greatest doughnuts in the city. They may not be as fancy and as eccentric as some other spots in the city but they are simply delicious. Small enough to be practically bite size, which is an issue because they are very addictive. The place it self doesn't look like anything special when you walk in, but I think that is on purpose. It all adds to the appeal of this little coffee shop and I think it is the main reason it is always packed with people studying and just chilling. If I had to give an atmosphere to it, I would describe it as more of a fun hipster like environment then other quieter, peaceful coffee shops. It's one of those places where you have conversations with everyone around you rather than just sitting in the corner with your earphones on. Great spot and a must try !
Great place!!!! We had a Yelp Elite event to taste their new Friday-Saturday "after dark" dinner menu. I decided to come back on my own the following week! Featuring TACOS $4 for 1, $7.50 for 2. Healthy and tasty is their objective. The dinner is different every week.They made meat taco and a veggie taco that night, I went for two beef tacos. Very tasty. The restaurant smelled delicious. Just a warning that their dinner is very, very, very small. Tapas style.I was there to study, similar to so many people. There is one communal table and many four-person tables. Well... you could separate the tables and they become two-person tables. Anyways, if you're alone (like so many Chez Boris customers), you can sit with another lonely stranger and share the space. Chez Boris is sometimes crowded and sometimes not. It's really just luck. Customers at Chez Boris tend to stay longer but they are very nice and will happily share the table. The WiFi unfortunately is extremely slow.The staff at Chez Boris are fantastic!!!! With the After Dark event (which is a dinner and a short horror film) they turn off the lights and quiet the room. I was the odd person studying with an actual book!!! and papers and pencil, not a laptop. They gave me a personal lamp so I can keep on reading during the film!!! That's so kind! I turned off the lamp after 5 minutes into the film, I felt awful keeping this bright light.Donuts are freshly made and delicious. $0.90 for one or $4.50 for 6. You can't beat this! I love the chocolate ones. I also had their donut sandwich with egg and bacon for $7. SO DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!I love it here! I love Chez Boris for the vibe and the donuts, and also the dinner if you stick around after 7pm.
I've been to Chez Boris a few times now, it's a great space to get a good coffee and get some work done.  I have tried the fresh donuts, the cinnamon sugar are my favourite. Its really special to be able to grab fresh donuts in the middle of winter, and not have to wait for a fair in the summertime. I was always slightly apprehensive to try a beignewich, but am really happy that I did.  I had the breakfast sandwich: egg, cheese, and bacon in between 2 donuts. It was just as delicious as it sounds.  I have definitely avoided going back since I don't want to make donut sandwiches a habit. But I am looking forward to returning to try a different beignewich in the future.. the pork belly one sounded awesome but wasn't on the menu at the time.
An eclectic Russian donut shop that's great for solo dining or groups.  Come in and try the beigne breakfast sandwich along with some good espresso to start your day . I also had the beets borsch which was rich, savory and full of beets and cabbage.
Nice cafe. Had a really nice time there meeting up with some friends. The coffee was OK and so were the donuts. The hot chocolate wasn't hot enough, but this happens in many establishments in Montreal. It's a self service place, no waiters. The crowed was young. Lots of laptops. It was relatively quite and very suitable for conversation. We may be back.
Great coffee - get a cappuccino or espresso but don't get the Cafe Solvetique. It tastes like thinned out soviet coffee and has sugar. BUT with coffee you get 2 freshly made donuts at no charge  if you get there before 10am.
We arrived a few minutes too late after the kitchen closed, so the beignewichs were not available. However the friendly guy behind the counter offered to whip up some sweet doughnuts for us instead. That gesture was enough to have me coming back the next day.And so we did!What we really came for were the infamous: Beignewiches. Order 1) Smoked salmon, capers, creme fraiche, cucumbers, cherry tomatoesOrder 2) Pulled pork belly, sprouts, scallions and hoisin sauceBoth served on savory doughnuts buns.IMAGINE THAT.I loved that the doughnuts were made to order. The beignewiches came out steaming hot -- tongue-burnable. The doughnut sandwiches were not overly saturated with bold flavors, but just enough to leave the palate wanting for more... and more. They also gave us a healthy sampling of a Russian salad that they were working on adding to their menu. Again, outstanding.Thanks for the great service and delicious beignewiches!
Came to brunch, bcz I heard about  their "beignewich" somewhere.simple and fresh donuts, appealing price, creative menu (it's a pity, they only had beignewich with pork), pleasant and polite service, lots places to relax, fashionably worn-out style decoration, free wifi.but what's most impressive for me was that they give a lot of care on each of their works (brewing coffee, frying donuts, presenting plates...). they really try to serve each one of us a cup of fresh coffee, fresh baked bacon, fresh fried donuts... everything fresh. I fell in love with their hospitality, I will come back to spend more time there next time.
I absolutely love this café! Their donuts are amazing and affordable, the service is quick even when they're making a fresh batch of their donuts plus the staff is really nice
You should really go try their donuts if you haven't already. They also have donut sandwiches that are quite tasty as well. Chez Boris has pretty good service and great coffee as well to go with your donuts. The cafe is usually full of people working on their laptops so it may be difficult to get a good seat. The hipster cafe is in a great neighbourhood of Montreal, so make sure to put this cafe on your to do list!
Nice donut and chai latte that what i had .Tell u something u dont Get more fresh Then that !!!
After hearing so many wonderful things about Chez Boris, now I completely understand why it has such a wonderful reputation. They are known mostly for their doughnuts, and they are truly as good as it gets. It's a basically buttery dough rolled and made all by hand. Fried in oil by hand as well. This truly a place that focuses more on quality over quantity. Also, they are not at all pricey. The place is very relaxed, great background music, with a wonderful ambiance by their clients. Both the place, the staff and, their homemade doughnuts are an absolute delight. A hot chocolate is an absolute must! Which they make a fantastic hot chocolate or coffees as well. A must try spot!
I went here after reading all the amazing reviews and was a little underwhelmed. The place looks like it's really just worn-down and in need of some renovating. I ordered a mixed basket of donuts and a tea and found the donuts to be a little hard and the tea to be very average. Definitely not a bad place but I really wasn't excited by it. Maybe I'll be more convinced after a second try - not sure just yet!
We made a special stop on our way out of town for the phenomenal pork belly beignet sandwich on the advice of a foodie friend.  Wow.  The fresh fried dough complemented the tangy sweet sauce, green onions and hot flavorful pork to perfection!  Better yet, the cappuccino was also expertly crafted.  For those interested in just a cup to dip fresh beignets into, it won't disappoint.  But seriously, go whole hog and get the pork belly sandwich.  The setting of this eclectic hipster cafe includes friendly service, free wifi, and a sunny storefront.  The bathroom was clean.  We will definitely be back!
Found out about their beignet special this morning (2 freebies with coffee before 10a) and happily chowed down two delicious morsels as I read my book on the comfy couch. It's a great space for working, socializing or quiet time. The staff is always friendly, there's usually plenty of space to sit, the food is fresh and yummy and I've always just felt at home here. Thanks for being so awesome!
A Chili con Car... No carne ? Beets ? Well... Ok sure, why not.*first bite* : OH MY GOD YESSo yeah I had a "chili con beets" and it was awesome, really.So not only do they have some pretty decent donuts (chocolate, cinnamon or plain sugar, an excuse to eat three when you get there) they also make some pretty interesting meals, I don't need to say more, you'll see the pictures posted on here and you'll be like : Damn !Damn indeed.
I actually met "the" Boris at a Yelp event ages ago. I was so surprised that a donut shop would exist in Montreal, I always kept it in the back of my mind to check it out. Sadly other things got in the way, and after I missed their one-of-a-kind poutine, I decided that was enough!So I went on a beautiful Sunday, and got myself a salmon beignewich (a sandwich where donuts replace the bread) and kvass (fermented apple juice). All was delicious, especially the kvass - totally unexpected. The donuts are homemade, in plain sight, a couple of minutes before being eaten, so they are light and crisp! My only little gripe was that the sour cream in the beigne (too much of it, and a bit cold). I'd love to go back soon and taste the rest of their offerings!Also, pack lightly, the place is cramped!
Tiny donuts. They're warm and decent, but I wouldn't say they're good, but small price to pay to use the washroom.
Heard SO MUCH about Chez Boris before heading there when I was on the verge of 'hangry'dom' the other day. I've sampled their home made donuts at a few events and they are quite nice although I'm more a fan of light fluffy yeast donuts and they are on the heavy dense side of the donut spectrum. The atmosphere was sweet and the servers were relaxed and warm but my order being filled was on the slow side. I ordered the savoury breakfast sandwich - smoked trout, cream and donuts. It was, of course, on the heavy side, but more than that surprisingly bland. No lemon, no capers...very little flavor. Perhaps it was an off day or that's not their specialty but was honestly a little disappointed. Would return for a coffee though (smelled delicious).
Loved this place!!!  Terrific espresso, delicious doughnuts made to order, friendly staff, board games, books, and plenty of couches, chairs, and tables to hang out at.  A great place for families with children looking for a place to relax at on a weekend morning.  Did I mention the terrific espresso and delicious doughnuts?!?
Came to chez boris with my friend every other morning when we studied abroad in Montréal.  Their ice coffee was absolutely delicious, their donuts were freshly made and tasted like heaven (especially the plain and chocolate donuts) but what really surprised me was how good their pierogi were. I grew up eating authentic polish and russian pierogis but theirs are just as yummy (the addition of dill sauce is awesome). To top it all off the prices were affordable and there was wifi!
We stopped by Chez Boris for breakfast on Wednesday morning around 930. The barista suggested that we each take advantage of the free doughnuts they were offering. Apparently, they had a special going on that if you came in between 830 - 10, you got two free doughnuts for free. We tried the chocolate, cinnamon sugar and sugar. They were fresh and delicious. I also had the sovietique cafe. The coffee wasn't bad. My boyfriend got the breakfast sandwich. I finished the sandwich, and although not healthy, it was delicious. There is plenty of seating, plugs and wifi. I would definitely return!
Chez Boris -  a Hipster joint @ Parc & Fairmont. Though I'm not a big fan of the hipster scenario (Maybe I'm too old for it), I decided to give this place a try. Their specialty, Doughnut sandwiches!!! Sounds out of this world?  It is. We tried the pulled pork doughnut & the cured Salmon doughnut sandwich. The doughnuts aren't too sweet, so you can taste the meaty flavors without the sweetness overpowering it.They taste really interesting. Also all the doughnuts are made onsite. After finishing our sandwiches, we were in a food coma. I donut wanna talk bout it. Tired of the "hole" thing.  Definitely worth a visitFood : GoodService :Friendly Ambiance : CasualWorth the price : Yes
Found Chez Boris on yelp before arriving to MTL and had it on my "must try list."Came here for 'brunch' on a Tuesday morning around 11am. I am def a fan of the hipster green-thumb decor! The donuts are called beignets, Russian term. I already forgot how to pronounce it (my bad!). The pulled pork beignet sandwich was totally legit, the hoisin sauce paired well, especially with the beignets hot and fresh! My bf had the egg & bacon beignets sandwich, equally good. The coffee served was the MTL staple. We wanted to try the regular donuts, but we were stuffed. Cool art on the walls, assorted random board games, random table map decor, and strong Wifi. We wanted to buy one of the posters behind the counter as a MTL souvenir,  but they were sold out :(
I'm not really a donut fan, but when it comes to Chez Boris donuts, I cant really stop eating them! They have 3 types: sugar, cinnamon and chocolate donuts, but my favorite is the cinnamon one, especially when its warm and just made. Their donuts are always fresh! If you go there for a coffee, or to study, they have a really nice place and a lovely decoration, and will start making the donuts there just in front of you!
Great neighbourhood meeting place. The coffee is excellent, and the environment is laid-back. The doughnuts are tasty and I really enjoy the dinner themes/events they do sometimes.
I ordered a cup of black coffee and 4 beignets. The beignets were two and a half inches in diameter. They were generously coated with sugar, cinnamon and cloves. The coffee was as deep and dark as the Forêt de Compiègne on a moonless night. Simply delightful!
I always go for the fresh doughnuts. Be ready to wait as they are cooked to order but they are so yummy and well worth the wait. I get a mix - half of them tossed in sugar and half of them tossed in cinnamon and sugar. Be ready to burn your mouth a bit because you won't be able to wait to consume these delicious pockets of fried dough. Make sure to grab napkins and it can be a little messy to eat. I love eating them while walking around the plateau. A great snack to keep the energy up.
Their donuts are perfect in all ways. We've looked for great donuts in Montréal for a long time with no luck until we found Chez Boris. They come in 3 flavors, all fresh from the fryer right in front of you: sugar, cinnamon, and chocolate sprinkles.
Freshly Made to Order Donuts!They were just so delicious and just made my hike worth my while.Vanilla, Dark Chocolate and Sugar (@ 80 cents) were all so good. Warm and Fluffy, not too oily and not too sweet. Perfect with my coffee. I can eat a dozen myself no problem.. but I guess I shouldn't...Chez Boris has quite a laid back vibe. Free Wifi and of course a lot of people with laptops hanging out here for hours....
Holy crow I love it here, I love the donuts and I love the Boris. First let's talk about everything but the obvious: Friendly, bright mellow place with big windows on Parc Ave and comfy mismatched chairs and a lending library. Plays hosts to events for good causes, good conversations, even the occasional sing along. The coffee is outstanding - I'll take a lovely latte or shot of espresso when the mood strikes, but if I can get a truly good cup of filter coffee that's my poison of choice, and Boris uses the 49th parallel beans to make you an individual cup dripped fresh in front of your face and smelling and tasting like awesome. OK, now the donuts. These are made in front of you every time. Tiny hot little darlins served in a basket, not heavy or oily or too sweet. The not too sweet basic flavour is key to the magic things Boris does with these donuts, turning them into a base for innovations like donut poutine, donut au canard, donuts with cream cheese and smoked salmon, and more. Go try, check the chalk board, hang out and give the smiling gents behind the counter a high five.
Went back yesterday night, the donuts were delicious like the first day. What made it even better is the extremely good service I received. I just bought a couple of donuts but the man behind the counter was so nice, I left with a smile (and two piping hot delicious donuts). Thank you!
I heard so many good things about the doughnuts at Chez Boris and I had a great expectation - it was a rather disappointing experience. It's not a bad thing you get to eat a freshly fried doughnuts but I didn't think it would take 10 - 15 mins to prepare, and the outcome was very mediocre. We ordered two doughnuts and came in very different sizes. The taste was good, any fresh fried dough wouldn't be bad unless you burn it - but really, it tasted like a doughnut I made for a Home Ec class when I was a kid. Not impressed at all. The cafe itself has a cool indie vibe but needs some improvements at the same time - looks a bit worn out. If you crave doughnuts, any Polish bakery or Dunkin Donuts would be a better option.
Donuts made fresh to order! Pretty good, but the ones we had from Cremy Patisserie outdo them by far. Nonetheless, chez boris has a cutesy fun atmosphere, and is a great place to come with a friend or a book -- or both!
They have a big sign outside claiming to have the best donuts in Montreal which I think hurts their credibility more than anything else. While they're good, they don't stand out particularly. However, two of my companions ordered the "beignewich" with eggs and hickory smoked bacon which they raved about. The decor is nice - it's a nice place to relax with friends. They have a few popular board games such as Monopoly, Scrabble, Cranium and jigsaw puzzles. They have a few books as well.
We discovered Chez Boris by a fluke. We were on Yelp and found that they had a great beignet. We were nearby so decided to give it a go! The beignets did NOT disappoint. We ordered the cinnamon and clove sugar beignets and they were amazing. They are small so order 2-3 for yourself. They come in a cool brown paper bag. The atmosphere was very Russian, which I loved growing up in Russia. The coffee was just okay.4 stars for the beignets!
Tried the cinnamon donut. Sadly a chain like Krispy Kreme is better. The donut is small given the price.The Lattes are terrible and bitter. I threw mine in the garbage as soon as I left the store.The decor was nice and the parking is difficult given the location on Parc.
If there's one thing I like in an espresso, it's that it works. Bo knows!Staff are friendly, fast and (look like they're having) fun. Sometimes it's packed, but if you need some room to sit and download torrents, it's a rad spot. Coffee is real and properly made, and everyone seems to dig their donuts. They have latkes too, which is impressive.
Amazing Donuts at fair price for the taste , they have a great selection of society games  and a good light temperament . The bad side must be the high price for a quite normal coffee and the lack of products .
I hate to give one star but it's usually a bad sign when you have to ask for your money back due to a restaurant's inability to fill an order. What we did get were two donuts that looked good but were so yeasty they taste like deep-fried beer. Now some people may like that but I didn't care for it. As for the rest of our order, it never came, hence the refund. Service was very confused here.
I wanted my 100th Yelp review to be a good one and a good one it shall be!  After hearing so many positive things about Chez Boris I knew I had to go.  Normally I am not a fan of doughnuts but that's because when you normally only ever have them from Tim's (as I do) you have no idea what you're missing out on.   Chez Boris has changed the way I see doughnuts though.  What makes the experience even better?  The prices are very reasonable for the product you get.I ordered a latte and a cinnamon doughnut which was made fresh to order so it was piping hot.  It was sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar and tasted divine.  The exterior was nice and crispy and the interior was soft and chewy.  I think if I had opted for a half dozen or dozen to take home for the next few days they would have been gone in a heartbeat!  The latte was also pretty good.The staff are friendly and the service is good.  I'd highly recommend this place and I know I'll be back for sure.
This place is great. Apparently they serve Russian donuts, but all I know for sure is they serve Awesome donuts here.The coffee is good too, and the combination of caffeine and donut is hard to top. My favourite is the 'blueberry berliner'. It's not that fake blueberry stuff you get in EVERY OTHER BLUEBERRY DONUT YOU'VE EVER HAD - it's the real deal.The staff here are really cool too. It's a good place to come and chill and get some work done. Highly recommended if you're anywhere near by.
The Russian donuts were pretty good and the Soviet coffee was good. Vintage Russian food selection was limited.The only thing that I didn't like was the fact the people who work here are not Russian which is very misleading. I came to Chez Boris expecting to see some Russian people and have Russian food. So having ordinary non-Russian bland people working there is a thumbs down for me.Not sure if I will go back to this place.
The internet is fast, the pierogis are tasty, the staff is friendly, the decorations are hella cute.
I arrived at Chez Boris at 9am with my kid in his stroller, and was delighted to find the place almost empty. When you have a toddler, you're always fearful of crowded places where your little hellion is going to wreak havoc and get you kicked out, or at the very least, scorned for all eternity with the burning stink-eye of the proprietors. Not so here. We went to the counter, ordered a coffee, two donuts, and a glass of milk, and pulled up to the big, well-worn couch to enjoy. I plopped the kiddo down and stripped off the ten million layers of outergear that one must dress your child in to avoid hypothermia in this city, and the barista/donutmistress brought us our treats. Fantastic. Crispy, hot, tender donuts with sugary topping, a nice drip coffee, and the milk was a hit with the kid. We sat there, eating our donuts, drinking our beverages, and giving a last read-through to the books we planned to return to the Mile-End library down the road, and I thought, this is as close to perfect as it gets. Afterward, we looked at the Snakes and Ladders game they had on the table, and studied some of the old maps plastered on other tables. Great atmosphere, great space (enough room for a stroller! hallelujah!), and great fare. They even open early enough to enjoy a treat before the library opens. Fantastic.
The coffee is delicious and the waitstaff is adorable. It's a cozy atmosphere too. What's not to love? I gotta go back and try those donuts.
Fresh DEEP FRIED Doughnuts!     ~OILY DEEP FRYER~I brought WARM freshly topped Beignes Sucres to my table.      Where's my Cannelle et Clou de Girofle? ( O O O ).  An Unidentified Assailant raided 1 of 3 Doughnuts ( O O ).                                        Come on~ I wanted to find out what "Cannelle et Clou de Girofle" was!Next time I meet Jennifer "raider" K, I'll take her Foie Gras. Let her know how -=délicieux=- it was afterwards.   :PFRESH  + DEEP + FRIED + DOUGHNUTS  =  + 4.0 *star*COFFEE + LINE UP + SEAT SITUATION     =  - 0.5 *star*                                                CHEZ BORIS  =  Trois.Cinq *star*
Yummy donuts. They are made a la minute, so if you are ever in need of a warm, light and fresh donut you will never be let down. Only complaint I have is the cleanliness of the place; I live in the Mile-End so I like the antique and mismatched vibe however I don't like the idea of my food being handled by the same person who gives me back my change. Besides that it's a cute place and I will definitely be back when I need to satisfy my sweet tooth!
Quick hitter here. Woke up on Saturday morning with a strong desire to try something different on my way to the market so I decided to finally go try a place that has been on my radar all summer: Chez Boris.Chez Boris is in the Mile End district on Park Avenue between Laurier and Fairmount and their speciality is doughnuts. For 75 cents each, you can get amazing fresh made-to-order doughnuts coated in a variety of different options. For my first visit (and it certainly won't be the last...), I got 2 sugar, one cinnamon and one raspberry. Each was perfectly cooked with a nice crisp exterior and a light fluffy interior which is all that you can ask for in a perfect doughnut.So you're interested in something outside of the usual donut shop for a quick hit of sweet, give Chez Boris a shot. You won't be disappointed. Also, any place that uses a SNES as a card holder deserves your attention ;)Cheers!
Excellent cafe! This is the first place where nothing is overcharged and has great quality. I would highly recommend it if you are around! (If not just hop into bus #80 and go there!)The stuff is extremely friendly, coffee can easily compete with Olympico.I'm not even talking about the fresh donuts! Try the cinnamon ones.All in all, if you are looking for good coffee and the best donuts in town this is the place to be.
Amazing donuts with a grungy-cool coffee house vibe. Chez Boris was pretty empty when I arrived and I wasn't actually sure if donuts were available. Turns out, they make them to order, so soon I was all set with 6 assorted sugar and cinnamon donuts. Basically, I recommend the donuts! They're obviously super fresh: really hot, crispy on the outside and just the teeniest bit oily. If you're picturing heavy Dunkin-style donuts, think again: these are light and airy, a little smaller than palm-sized. My friend ate 3 of them, which is good because it's nice to share, but bad because I could have eaten all 6.I also got a chai latte which could have been a little stronger, and my friend got an egg sandwich which was a fried egg, some bacon, and cheese served in on top of a large donut with a smaller one on top. They have other small food options as well...or you could just get more donuts.
Very yummy donut sandwiches - I loved my pork belly/hoisin/green onion combo. My date found his egg and bacon one a little off-putting. You have to be ready for the sweet & salty excitement, and also know that the sandwich is quite heavy even if it looks small! Fair enough price, good drink options, but the vibe was that of study hall. I wish it had been a little more upbeat, but it would be a great place to snack and study... alone. The place was full but we were the only ones having a conversation!
Stopped by on our trek back from the bagel shop, and I am so glad we did!The shop clerk was super friendly, even with our indecisiveness. We ended up getting 6 donuts (1/2 sugar, 1/2 cinnamon) , a filtered coffee, and hot apple cider.The donuts were great , but the hot apple cider was awesome!! Seriously spiced, and almost creamy tasting. So. Delicious.
Full of studying students and hipsters in their native environment.  Doughnuts aren't bad.
Nice atmosphere. Friendly staff. Fresh warm Russian donuts... Need I say more? Check this place out, worth the experience. Also try the cidre chaud! Delicious! The soviétique is worth a try too :)
The breakfast donut sandwich with cheese, bacon, and egg is easily one of the best dishes I have ever eaten. All parts are perfectly cooked and the doughnuts are fantastic. The latte is also incredible. Great place for a cute, quick coffee and delicious donuts to go around. Easily one of my favorite, if not favorite, eatery in the city. Also, wonderful place for people watching and doing homework or both! Go here!!!
This is one of my favorite cafes in Montreal. The coffee is a tad on the expensive side but the atmosphere is great for working or reading. And as a great added bonus the hand made donuts are amazing.
I was introduced to Chez Boris by my friend and I'm glad he did because it's one of the top cafes on my list. Great ambiance and space with delicious coffee and tasty snacks. Crowded on a weekend morning/afternoon but if you're willing to wait a bit it may be worth it. It's calmer on a week day afternoon/evening which makes for an excellent study/work place. Wifi is unlocked and reliable and the music blends in with the environment. Take a book, leave a book, walk in, check it out, order to go or sit for a while.
Mmmmmmh good tasty really delicious fresh made to order and not too oily cute little donuts.Sugar, Cinnamon, Chocolate (dark) with good filter coffee...MMMMMHHHHH, the perfect combination. LOVE IT
what's not to love about this russian donuts shop? simple light inexpensive donuts, donuts sandwiches, some coffee and my favorite, the kvass, a fermented bread juice with fruits (apples) and some yeast
I was just walking on the street when I saw this place. The name sounded pretty cool, so I decided to stop by. And I do not regret this, the staff is incredibly cool and the doughnuts are great. It's a great place to spend time in. You should totally go there.
Discovered this place after walking around the area.  Great cafe for beignets and hot chocolate from scratch! Atmosphere is very relaxing, server was helpful and friendly. If you find yourself in the Mile End...stop here for a pick-me-up.
Just had my first Russian Donut at Chez Boris today...and wow...it was incredible!!! I do not think I will ever eat a donut anywhere else ever again. I used to think it was an ok idea to eat donuts that had been sitting on a rack for indefinite amounts of time; not anymore - this place has changed my mind. Your donuts are fried right after you order them at Chez Boris, they are small, so you can order one or two or three depending on how much you want, and the crazy thing is that they are only 0.50 cents each. They come fresh out of the frier and get dusted in confectioner's sugar, so you get them just a tiny bit crispy, just the right amount of sweat, I didn't know what I was missing!! Apparently this is the way they are sold on street corners in Russia, and also the way they should always be everywhere. Plus there is a homemade Russian soft drink called Kavass that I'd never tried before which was very good - yeasty taste with a hint of sweetness, hard to describe, but definitely something I will order again. Ambiance is really chill. Boris is pretty much the coolest person ever. There is free wif, and the place is very open and spacious but homey at the same time, with plenty places to sit.Highly recommended!
As someone who loves donuts, I have been on a mission to find some of the most delicious homemade donuts in Montreal and came across Chez Boris. After walking 3 km to get to Chez Boris, I was excited to try what I thought would be an unforgettable donut.Sadly, the freshly made cinnamon and sugar donuts they offer are forgettable. I've made better donuts at home, myself. The cafe filtre I had with my fresh donuts was a little disappointing.I brought some of the special flavors home to try for breakfast tomorrow (one flavor is double chocolate, the other is lime + juniper) simply because I took the trouble to walk  a half hour there and did not want to leave empty handed. When I tried them the next morning, the chocolate was okay, though the lime + juniper tasted like a gin and tonic, and it was not very moist; almost too dry to eat.If you're in the area, it's worth checking out once. However, Chez Boris does not make a 'destination donut' worth a special trip. I was disappointed that on my walk home, I was able to find incredible donuts for half the price of the Chez Boris specialty donuts at a small place called Boulangerie Patisserie Nouveau Samos on St. Laurent. It doesn't look special from the outside, but their donuts are amazing and not to mention huge!
I love this place! It's still not overly crowded as some cafes are in the area. Nice atmosphere and staff. They have a small games collection for you to play with friends. Also, the arcade game thing there makes my life.
Their russian donuts (80 cents each) are made fresh in front of you, are barely oily,with a touch of chewiness, are just absolutely delicious, and warm my cold donut hating heart. The ambiance itself is wonderful, with lots of light and a lending library. I plan on hibernating there regularly throughout the Montreal winter.
Went to Montreal last summer and got Chez Boris.... I've literally dreamed about their doughnuts ever since. I actually stopped in and was waiting on my boyfriend to get there, while I was waiting the super nice guy working there asked what I was getting and I let him know I didn't have any canadian money on me, and he gave me coffee and doughnuts BEFORE I paid! Such a nice atmosphere/ staff/ and amazing food. Plus! an entire wall of bookcases with board games! We ate doughnuts, drank coffee, and played scrabble on the sidewalk outside. It was dreamy.
Friendly service. Inexpensive. Great coffee and hot chocolate. Beignets are made to order and delicious.
Best Brazilian Restaurant in Montreal! You can feel like home in there! I tried bolinho de bacalhau and caldo verde, just amazing!
good cozy family run business. you see the passion at there work. Great steak, calamari a la planche, ceviche. good but not wow. i guess i've been too spoiled with churrascaria too often and this is more a traditional home cooked style.
Really nice small restaurant with authentic Brazilian fare. The staff are very friendly and helpful and make you feel welcome. Decent wine selection, only one Portuguese bock beer. This restaurant is a real underrated gem.
Excellent food and authentic. Service was excellent and attentive. It's a great little gem if you are looking for real home style Brazilian food rather than the all you can eat grills.
Awesome home Brazilian cooking!  The proprietor/chef was welcoming, and very gracious in explaining all dishes off the menu, which was written in French.  Standouts included cod fritter appetizers, beef stew (fejaoda), steak, and the kaprinha cocktails.
Our group of seven went in for dinner on a Friday night. The atmosphere is nice and cozy and the staff were friendly. Having never had experience authentic Brazilian food, I was happy to try it out for the first time. I ordered a soup for appetizer and slow cooked meat stew for the main course. The caldo verde soup was good, and warms you up quickly from the cold winter. The stew was delicious. The pork and beef were very tender, and the flavors were very tasty. I only wished there was a little more rice or another starch, as there was so much sauce and it would have made the stew even better. Price was okay at around $30. My friends also enjoyed their meal. Overall, a great place to try out Brazilian food, and I would go back to try something different.
The service was extremely slow, and the food seemed to be overpriced for what it was. The food itself was neither amazing nor inedible.
They are now open for lunch Fri-Sun. We started with the chicken nuggets And had the Feijoada as a main.Service was excellent, the owner is a very witty and friendly man. The nuggets where good but I was no a fan of the doughy texture. He suggested the traditional slow cooked Feijoada dish with black beans, braised pork sausage, rib and beef (brisket I believe). It was very tasty! The meat was incredibly tender and had a nice slightly smoky flavour - reminded me of wood oven roasted meats from a Brazilian steak house.It was a very good hearty meal for a very reasonable price. I recommend.
so we had a UYE there some weeks back where I was one of the 2 regular yelpers to be present.. they brand themselves as traditional Brazilian restaurant. to be frank, i've never had traditional Brazilian food so I can't compare as I have no reference point but what I can tell you is that it's not bad at all. was it making your buds sing? it didn't sang much. not saying it was bad but I need to go back to try some more.anyway, I had the chicken nuggets which was OK and a fish ceviche which I don't remember the name of it. that one was flavorful and tasty. it came with a serving of green tortilla chips. green for the flag color obviously. extremely cheesy! service wise, it took a while, a long while. like most reviews, that's a problem for the place. there's only one cook and it's made to order therefore it takes forever.we got a nice chat with the son, owner of the place and learned quite a bit on the place and history of it. something you don't know about that they, for unknown reasons, don't mention much except through photos hanging on the wall, they cater to celebrities. movie stars, producers and the likes that come to the city, well, they cater to Hollywood.food is decently good. place is relatively unknown to a lot of people because of a big lack of marketing and not being savvy enough. anyway, if you have lots of time to kill and are in the neighborhood and hungry, it's a place worth considering
I was torn between giving this 3 or 4 stars. I decided to be nice :) The food here is really good! It tastes authentic and you don't leave feeling overstuffed, greased out or nasty. I found the Caipirinha to be okay - nothing really to scream about, but the other reviewers like it, so I would give it a try. Per the other yelp suggestions, we tried the Feijoada and Ximxim. Both were very very delicious.The thing about this place is the wait. We waited for more than an hour before we got our food and there was only one other party in the restaurant. It may be because the mother is the only one cooking. Yes, I appreciate that home-cooked style feeling, but not at the expense of me waiting more than one hour for any action. Another cook would be better. So, totally up to you. If you don't mind waiting a really long time, need some time to catch up with your long lost friend or lover - go here. But if you want something delicious and quick, keep walking.
Great food and great service. The owner is so kind and helpful when it came to our budget and food interests. He helped us order an amazing meal! Delicious pulled pork and beans,  coconut shrimp and cashew chicken on rice! The meal included soup and salad appetizer. He even told us how to eat the sliced orange before the beans as it aids digestion and is what Brazilians do :) I walked away feeling so full and healthy!
If you're looking for authentic Brazilian food, or if you've never tried Brazilian food before, you'll love this place. The menu has a great mix of options from different areas of Brazil - try the bolinho de bacalhao (they're like cod croquettes) and the coxhinha (fried mashed potato croquettes with chicken inside). The ceviche is also amazing! The staff are super friendly and warm. Definitely worth checking out.
We ate every last bit.  I recommend the Xim Xim. The Calamar grille was OK. The mango salad was tasty.
Truly excellent Brazilian food. The owners are a witty Brazilian man and his mother. She handles all the cooking with precision. Nothing here is rushed, or can be, for that matter. The decor is quaint, the service laid back --almost to a fault -- but the caipirinhas are truly outstanding and the food reminded our Brazilian friend of his childhood. As for us, non-Brazilians, we were thoroughly enchanted by the whole experience. Strongly recommended. And the prices are very reasonable, by the way.
Great Brazilian food, awesome experience.The owner is a funny man who made our dinner even better with his great sense of humor. The food was delicious, very home made, I had feijoada and my husband had xin-xin. Both were awesome.
Great food!I'm Brazilian and this is the most authentic food I have eaten in Montreal. Delicious! The service was a bit slow, but it was obvious that the food was made all from scratch in the kitchen.Overall the service was great, the food was well priced with good portions, the drinks were really nice!( great caipirinha!) Also the vegetarian menu was delicious! With soups and salads to go with it.
Great and authentic Brazilian food. Pastel, coxinha and the feijoada were absolutely perfect!
Try the Xim Xim (I think pronounced "zim zim"). I had it! A-freaking-mazing. Best dish on the menu.The first time I went here, my friends and I were wandering down St-Laurent looking for Indian food. We walked by and took a look a the menu posted outside. Being students, we were a little irked by the prices and were discussing this. A lady overheard us and started to say the food was really quite good. She then said she was the owner and makes all the food herself. She even used to have a catering business that served movie productions (hence the photos on the wall). So she promised us that if we didn't like the food, we would get our money back! We got in there, and (I think) one of her sons was the waiter for the day. He was hilarious while we waited for the food (which was just a tad long but so, so worth the wait). We ordered appetizers and main dishes. Main dish proportions were large, easily could feed two people but it was so good I ate it all myself.Last, we tried one of the drinks, I forget the name, but it was a specialty with limes and crushed ice and Brazilian liquor. The next time I was there, I ordered two of them. (And hey, at six bucks, they're not too bad!)Basically, really friendly people and amazing food was had at Acajou. Go!
Oh this place,about a year ago I happened to be strolling down Laurier trying entertain to some family , it was a warm balmy night , the air was still and our belly's were empty.we were looking for something to satisfy our hunger and provide a  comfortable resting place for us as a young family to catch up, talk about our new endeavors , and revel in the summer air we so cherish that is left ; in late august Montreal.As we entered the doors we were warmly welcomed by the presumed owner of the establishment. upon being seated and  ordering our various drinks, some of them being alcoholic , we felt comfortable and warm in comparison to the cooling night air we had so  been accustomed to seconds prior.lets just say the rest of the night was not so pleasant , my sisters peanut butter soup seemed really delicious, but also my brothers chopped up pineapple with sliced  ham seemed really good. once i finally got my steak it was cooked AMAZINGLY, the meat itself was blacker then the darkest corner of my cockroach infested apartment on the shortest day of the year. after our meal, whole faimily was accused of underage drinking. needless to say we spent alot of money . Acuju Br is one of my favourite restaurants in the Montreal , AND FOR GOOD REASON .Peace, love and recognition for  panama canal cuisine. if not for the  experience, come for the feeling and ethnic experience.sincerely ,          Stuart William Mitchell III
Visited Montreal for a weeklong family vacation last month. We had a lot of great food at various price ranges, some higher some lower. Went to the famous smoked meat places, got bagels, poutine (several times), the orange drink, etc. and even had some great Chinese food. Loved most of it.... but out of all the places we ate, Acajou Br is the one meal still on my mind! Their feijoada in particular is wonderful. They don't have many reviews but it should tell you something that all of them are very good. This is my first Yelp review.... I'm usually the guy who thinks "if a restaurant got my money, and I didn't send anything back, that should be enough positive feedback for them" but I truly hope more people learn about this place so they can thrive!
This place is mind-blowing. Awesome home-cooked style Brazilian food at an affordable price. Perfectly grilled meats, great vegetarian options, and savory smoothies (try the mango!) Don't get discouraged by the long cooking times - the owner/chef is making everything a la minute in the back. This place is simply glorious. To add even more to the proverbial pie, the owner gave us bowls of what I can only describe as the best lentil soup I've ever had, on the house, because of the wait. This is a gem that should not be ignored!
I tried Feijoada and Ximxim and both were delicious homemade dishes. The host is super friendly. Make sure to bring an appetite, these are filling comfort foods.
There is no wonder why this place is always packed with people! Nos Thés is popular for their great variety of bubble teas, but they also have an extensive menu of Asian snack foods and entrées. I had ordered the chicken-katsu and really enjoyed it. Rice was sticky, chicken was crisp and tender, curry tasted like curry! While they are a Taiwanese resto, they nailed this Japanese classic. I can only vouch for their red bean tea, served hot, with bubbles. They let you decide the amount of sugar that goes in but their teas are best when sweet. My girlfriend really enjoyed her winter melon iced tea as well. For under $20 you are set with food and tea. A great place with friendly staff. Love them!
AVOID The matcha ice cream was a RIPOFF. It was just 2 small balls of supermarket-bought vanilla ice cream along with some 'matcha' lumpy liquid which you had to mix in with the ice cream. This cost me 7$ after tax.
Best Matcha Bubble Tea in Montreal~Nos Thés is located right next to Concordia University downtown, and has a nice bright entrance with large windows. The people working the register are quick to take your order. While it is sometimes slow to wait for drinks, there's some room near the register to sit and wait. While I've only ever ordered bubble tea here, it's always been fantastic. The matcha tea lattes are delicious -- they always properly prepare the matcha.
Nos thés is not only about tea but also about Asian food Taiwanese & Chinese. We tasted many dishes & it was tasty. The place is pretty well located on Ste Catherine street & close to Concordia university.  Lots of students & free WiFi.  We were a group of 6 & ordered over 8 plates except for one person,  they obliged that person to order or else she wasn't aloud to stay. I thought that was petty especially with the amount of orders we had!
Food: The sweet potato fries are to my liking~ Do not order fried squid, waaaaaay too much dough and flavorless~ In addition, I find almost all the milk tea (except special flavors like lavender...) all taste the same~ OoService: Did I mention how during lunch rush hour on Friday they have one staff attending al the tables? - -"
AVOID FOOD.Been here a couple times for drinks, but it was only recently that I tried food from their menu (don't do it).Best bubble tea I've had in Montreal, comparable to certain bubble tea places in Toronto, but not as fantastic as the ones I've been forced (by my friends) to have in Taiwan (not a fan of milk and tapioca). They use real frozen fruits (for many drinks) and good tea instead of diluted tea and flavoured powder. I guess that's an explanation for the time takes to make a drink.Food:Average-priced, inauthentic, and dare I say, revolting. We tried 3 different items from the menu, and they all tasted terrible (2/5). It seems like the chefs don't know how to use a deep frier: fried food, as illustrated in my photos, were overcooked, dry, and tasteless. The 'zha jiang' noodles, suggested by our waiter, had a skewed taste. The recipe is simple and the ingredients are broadly accessible, so how they manage to screw it up is still a mystery today.Would come back when I feel like getting my hands on a mango iced tea ehehe.
Pretty place with pretty decor with pretty drinks with pretty chairs (yes the chairs are in plastic but still pretty). I come here ONLY and MAINLY, EXCLUSIVELY for bubble tea. Any season is bubble tea season. Tea tea tea drink tea. Add stuff everywhere! Tapioca pearls, lychee or mango or anything! Your choice! I usually take everything regular but no ice! Who needs ice??? Without ice, more tea to drink!But the wait is long within rush hours.
A really good place, iv'e been a few times, and there is so much options that I really can't decide what to eat only after 25 minutes. The ambiance has this warm feeling and although there is a lot of space, it is always somewhat calm. Sadly, there isn't much desert, which I kinda always look forward to in places like this.Good for groups and pretty cheap too!
I ordered the Taiwanese beef noodle soup and it was superb. It came in a large bowl and immediately I tasted the soup. The soup is done correctly with the right amount of beef flavour and it wasn't msg. Then I tried a bite of the beef and it was delicious. They provide you with enough beef slices to keep you full. I had beef slices that were both fatty and both lean, so it's luck of the draw I guess. There were also green onions and veggies in the soup which really enhanced the overall flavour of the soup. Highly recommend this dish. Note that they also allow you to add 1$ for extra noodles or $1 for hand made thick noodles. Next time if I was hungry I would add the extra money for more noodles. Mean came to $12 after tax.
Visiting Montreal, decided to check out this Taiwanese place to get our Asian fix (we are from Toronto). Came here with my 2 asian buddies and one Latin dude who self invited himself to our little road trip. I usually get popcorn chicken back home, so I was looking forward to trying them here. I've never ate a cactus before, but this is probably what it's like. Wasn't hot upon arrival, dry, over cooked, and under seasoned. I started to question why we even came to Montreal and my head started to hurt a little, probably due to my mind being blown over how anyone can screw up popcorn chicken this badly. Also had the visar noodles. Friends got the beef brisket noodles, and the tonkatsu, which were on point, as were the drinks - they were good, but I didn't orgasm in my mouth.It was a Saturday afternoon so it was pretty busy, as a result, service was slow and the food took a while. I could tell the two Chinese girls sitting at the table next to us were beginning to rage as they've been waiting for their food for some time. Now that I think about it, they didn't seem like they liked each other too much... Maybe there was some drama going on, who knows? Girls are complicated.Anyway, being a group of guys, we didn't mind the wait too much, aside from the fact that we were STARVING AS F**K! But it was cool still. Making conversation and creeping on the other restaurant patrons distracted us from our bellies.Returned the next day for take out drinks.All in all, a good experience. After I find a therapist to hypnotize me into forgetting the popcorn chicken, I'll be sure to return for another meal!
My friends and I just dropped by to have a study session here. Their new location is so much more spacious! Decor looks more simple, and clean which I like a lot more than their old place on St. Matthieu.  Crowd is not too bad in the afternoon- around half full. I do know that it gets packed late weekend nights though. I ordered an azuki matcha Latte here and also dark roasted oolong. As always they provide tiny and regular boba - but now they also provide transparent bobas in the mix. Very interesting. I think my favourite remains their oolong milk teas (the flavor is pretty rich). And you can control the amount of sugar you want in your tea. I think their quality of tea has remained consistent over the move. I say this because I was really skeptical at first because my azuki matcha latte was a little blander than usual in comparison to when I had it in their older location. But I realized I had ordered less sugar.My friends tried the rose osmanthus milk tea and jasmine green milk tea. I really liked the jasmine green tea. Very rich. I was neutral with the rose tea because my friend ordered no sugar. I kind of like a bit of sugar in my teas . Of course there was a bit of a wait time because they are brewing tea bag by tea bag. But I suppose that our order came in faster than usual because the place isn't packed. Service here is usually quite good. Waitress are very attentive - and don't rush you like other places I've been to in other bubble tea cafes. Be warned, if you are here to surf the web - internet here is very unstable.  My only concern has always been the wait time. When it gets busy, I still have to wait around 10-15minutes. It's a drag if you are rushing.
Yes, incredible taro bubble tea as Jane mentioned. There are actual pieces of taro in it - you might even want to skip the bubbles on this one. I always go for half-sweet. The place is big with lots of sit down tables and it's faster than it used to be. I did not have the chance to try the food at Nos Thés. Debit only.
Wonderful place for bubble tea and chinese noodles. Got the vanilla nut milk tea with tiny pearls and it was really delicious. Service was good. Will hang out at this place again!
The food was really good and the portions are okay, but I was not impressed with the customer service. I understand that they are few, but they do not talk with each other. As a customer, it felt like the employees hated their jobs or that none of them like to communicate. It was like this for the both times I went there. Again, heads up for the food and the modeling of the place! It's a very cute place to go
I absolutely love Nos Thes. I get a different tea almost every time I go there and have never been disappointed.I usually get one of the milk teas, with bubbles of course. I really like the Lavender Assam tea, it has the perfect combination of flavours for me. The taro bubble tea is good too, but less unique as you can get that almost anywhere else. Nos Thes really specializes in quality loose-leaf milk teas.Don't discount the food either, it is authentic Taiwanese. Beware - the portions for some of the dishes are huge! I ordered the mushroom and vegetable soup and needed help to finish it! They're open quite late as well, so there really is no excuse not to go!
I ate there twice and my second experience was much better than my first.What I ordered:Honey oolong milk tea with tapioca Fresh taro milk tea no tapiocaMinced pork with ricePopcorn chicken snack Scallion pancake no egg1. The milk teas are extremely sweet so I'd definitely recommend you order them half sweet and add sweetner if you want it more sweet2. Minced pork and rice is a classic Taiwanese dish. This was not fantastic but def not horrible. It comes with steamed broccoli which I found tone a bit random. Probably should come with pickled greens or other non-crunchy greens3. Popcorn chicken- amazing! Order this! It's fried in a way where it was not greasy and so very tasty!!! It gets soggy if you bring it home so not worth the to-go baggy4. Scallion pancake was good minus the sauce they poured on top- next time I'd ask for sauce on the sideOverall a positive experience! I'd def get the popcorn chicken and taro milk tea (half sweet) every visit!
I really enjoy the ambiance here, especially the variety of jazz tunes played softly in the background.  I also highly recommend the chocolate peanut butter banana bubble tea.  Try the small tapioca pearls for an interesting variation!
A friend recommended this place and I was not disappointed! I only went there for a drink, but it was good enough to make me want to go back again :) the service was pretty fast considering that the place was almost full. And the drinks were amazing, I've never liked a bubble tea this much! I usually drink smoothies with bubbles but I got an actual flavored milk tea and it was so good. I tried my friends' drinks too and they were delicious too. Will be back for sure! :)
Stopped by for bubble tea after being told that the prices are very reasonable for the size you get! Definitely the case. I was happy that I could make customizations on my order (sweetness, temperature, etc.). The bubbles were just the right texture and slightly sweetened, making them a great complement to the beverage.I also tried some of the snacks. They were made in traditional Taiwanese style and although a little bit small in size for the prices, quite delicious.Would go back again for the ambiance and drinks though I might pass on the food. Definitely not a bad place to spend a few hours catching up with friends!
wow even better tapioca than what I have in Toronto!! delicious and chewy, also not tasteless. I always order the handmade Taro hot milk tea (almond milk substituted), it took a while to make but it was super yummy. Even with NO sugar, it still tastes very sweet and creamy. When I'm back in Toronto, I crave this!! I love it.The three mushroom rice and Zhajiangmian are only okay, not that great. But huge portions! The braised beef noodles are delicious though, not spicy. I prefer the Vasir noodles over Zha-Jiang noodles.Service is excellent here. So five stars for perfect drinks and service! The food is so-so, Nos Thés is not my first choice if I am hungry.
I love this place, a perfect hangout spot for students and they even have the plushy chairs to sit on! service can get a little slow during weekends, an average of 10 minutes for takeout and 20 min for non takeout. The bubble tea is made using brewed tea and not artificial powder like many other so called bubble tea shops, for $5 you can get a large bubble tea that's quite filling and there are many options to choose from! the food isn't that great and actually made me sick at one point.
Located around Guy Concordia, Nos Thés offers a variety of specialty teas and a few Taiwanese dishes. Well lit and spacious, it was great place for a rendez-vous. The Dark roasted Oolong Cold Milk Tea was really tasty - just remember to add sugar to their teas.I would go back:For a sit-down bubble tea dateTo study with a friendNos Thés (at Guy Concordia) is best for:Dates of 2 or groups up to 8 people (reserve if you are many!)Its extensive drink options: with or without bubbles (different kinds), hot or cold, with or without sugar, etc.Full review: seizonal.com/2015/03/13/…
Good food and really great tea. The only reason it's a four is because there is a "everyone buy something" policy. I wasn't thirsty or hungry but if I wanted to stay with my friend I had to order something. The place is really nice and the service is fast and friendly.
The only place to get boba drinks in the city.  So impressed that They use real taro in their drinks and not the artificial powdered chemical that 99% of other boba places use.
Came here on an evening where the restaurant was my second choice ..very unexpected..Anyway , they have moved to this location a couple weeks ago , the restaurant used to be small that it was such a surprise to come down here in such a big space . Restaurant seems to be doing good thou , 3/4 packed , lots of people arriving or taking drinks for to go.Regardless , I came here with a date for food as we were starving. Thereby , we didn't take any drinks --from my experience drink wise --it's not as bad as one would think. This review will focus on the food. We grabbed a Tonkatsu plate , a braise beef noodle soup and some sweet potatoes French fries.Let's start with the Tonkatsu, rice had soya sauce added, but a bit too much . I think that was the problem, too much of everything concerning the seasonings. For example , my chicken had too much of sauce --it made the entire plate way too sweet. Even the most decent part of the plate the salad --had too much sweet sauce . Overall , the plate wasn't as great as I had expected. Although , it is sort of my fault as I took a Japanese plate inside a Taiwanese plate , maybe the food of their cuisine is better --who knows maybe another yelper could tell me about it.The braise beef soup was average. Noodles are not homemade , and thereby , they come fresh from the frozen fridge. Beef was fresh and soft --not a bad quality of beef for the plate. I think it tasted just fine. Although, the soup of the plate was not too good , clearly there was a lack of flavour --as well as it didn't taste as spicy as it did . Think there was too much MSG , honestly I feel like that is how is tasted.As for the sweet potatoes fries , they are great and long. They changed their sizings of the potatoes comparatively to their last location. They were seasoned appropriately although , I think there was a bit too much salt. The salad that comes with it could be refreshing for some, it's the same as in my Tonkatsu plate, I guess it could help yourself to not feel too bad after finishing all the fries by yourself! Overall , this appetizer was good.So conclusion, restaurant is mediocre in terms of food , I guess it could be worth it if one wants to eat small things like appetizers and grab a drinks. However , I beg to differ in the scenario that one wants to try their meals as from my experience today , it really wasn't worth it.
This is my go to place for bubble tea. They have a huge selection of flavors, and you can even choose between different bubble types. I personally like my tea without ice, with mixed tapioca bubbles, and at half-sweet (the standard sweetness for bubble tea almost everywhere I have found too sweet). While this place is lovely to sit with friends, and they also serve full meals, I would not recommend it as a work or study place because the wifi is somewhat inconsistent.
Awesome, awesome bubble tea.Final solution to the bubble tea problem in  MTLFreshly made tapioca bubblesFreshly made teaNatural flavours for the most partDecent foodFriendly staffTakes interacFree WiFiOnly complaint:It's LOUD. I'm talking Peel Pub loud. So don't expect a laid-back atmo, not happening.
An unassuming place based on its logo making it seem like it's just an Asian-inspired cafe, we were pleasantly surprised by just how great the food, drinks and price were. Most importantly, we were very pleased with how knowledgeable, friendly and efficient the  Taiwanese young man serving us was, whom we're told is the only Taiwanese person at this Taiwanese restaurant. We ordered the lunch set, which came with a savoury miso soup, an asian cucumber salad and a cup of their refreshingly awesome green tea with orange zest. Our entrees were right on the money; we recommend the Vasir options, as the braised pork was perfectly braised and seasoned. We happen to live in South Korea and have been to Taiwan before as well, and we can gladly say the food was fantastically authentic. If you're looking for a true Taiwanese meal, this place does the job and does it well.
First time here.i tried the fresh mango manic...it was so good ,so fresh...but a bite expensive...large one cost 8$....I will come back for sure!they have a beautiful waitress too....
Overall speaking, i love this place . A great place for friends gathering and chatting. A little bit pricy compared to its counterparts, but the snacks here are delicious.
I have been to this place a few times now. The food was great and the portion was generous.  You will have to get used to waitresses's quirky attitudes.   It's just different. I will come back!
Came here for a late dinner. I got a noodle dish with minced pork. It was well-seasoned and had a mix of savory and sweet flavors. Their noodles were thick and had a wonderful texture. They also had a variety of drinks, but I didn't order one, though if I had come earlier in the day, I probably would have, since they looked pretty decent. The staff here are very friendly.Definitely would come here again to try other items if I'm ever in town again.
Great teas, lattes, and appetizer.  Wow, really enjoyed my iced vanilla latte, fried calamari, sweet potato fries, and salad.  Beautiful presentation.\\see my pics =)
Nos Thes can be either amazing or just OK, depending on what you're coming for.We ordered a few dishes for dinner: the popcorn chicken was interestingly spiced and breaded. Though it started out seeming like a wonderful alteration on the typical Taiwanese style, it got old a lot faster than I initially expected, as the mealiness of the breading got to me over time. The zha jiang noodles I had were neither spicy nor flavorful; just an overall disappointment.Where this place shines is its tea. So many places make their bubble tea sickeningly sweet, but Nos Thes offers an extensive list of full-bodied teas that strike a balance with the boba instead of just matching its sugar content.Come for the tea and skip the food.
This is the first time I've been to their new location since they renovated and they definitely up'd their game. The space is really nice, lots of seating and I love the yellow they have with the wood. Their bubble tea is still as good and I love that you can get the tiny bubbles everyday now instead of just specific days like before. I have yet to try their food but they have good drinks. My favourite is the rose black tea with tiny bubbles!
Not bad, though they can be a bit pricey. The portion sizes are decent, and the servers will try to upsell you (unless you're onto their game, or speak Chinese haha! Good try guys - I might be brown, but I've been around!) Having said that, their Taiwanese popcorn chicken is VERY heavy on the breeding (and it just doesn't have very good flavor - kinda confused flavor actually). The dumplings, soups, noodles were pretty standard, however their boba was pretty excellent. Wait times are a bit long tho, and to eat here, EVERYONE in the group MUST buy something or be asked to leave (they don't want Wifi moochers)
I can't put 0. Asked me and my girlfriend to leave our table(take tea to go) because only my girlfriend was ordering. Is dirty inside and smelt funny to top that. Avoid !
Five stars for their exceptionally good bubble tea. They have a great variety that you can choose from. We come here all the time for their bubble tea. Instead of having bubbles, try red beans instead!Their food is so so, probably just three stars if solely base on food.Best bubble tea!
Everything about Nos Thés is just so cute, from the cute setup to the cute mason jars the cold bubble teas come in. It's a great place to go if you're in a small group, since it has a nice cozy and relaxed ambiance. Their food is also really good! The only hiccup is that their service can be a bit slow at times.
Excellent, friendly, knowledgeable staff. Delicious, good quality teas. Easily customizable (milk, soy, almond milk, level of sugar, large, small or mixed sized tapioca, different jellies, either hot or cold) large and varied selection - all very well priced. It is a spacious and lovely environment. I highly recommend this place
Let me start off by saying that the decor here is wonderful, it has a great ambience and I would love to come and study here with friends. The drinks are also great, I was super happy with my bubble tea. But will I ever come back here? No.I went on Saturday the 12th. The service was absolutely appalling and I left so upset and angry. A friend and I ordered drinks and some food to share. Our first dish was just alright. The second dish was absolutely disgusting and felt undercooked. I finally got the nerve to complain and they took the dish away, both my friend and I had just a bite each. When we went to pay they still put the item on our receipt, wanting us to pay. I argued that it made no sense for us to pay when we had sent it back complaining that it wasn't cooked properly. The cashier said "Oh. You just didn't like it so you have to pay". I kept saying that no other restaurant would ask for this. He said "Well this isn't a high class place, you clearly haven't been out before". Excuse me? He got increasingly more rude towards me, it took us about 5 minutes of him eye rolling and giving us dirty looks for it to be taken off the bill. I've never complained in a restaurant before, and I wasn't rude at all, but his attitude upset me so much, and not just because he wouldn't take it off, but because of how I was treated. I would have loved to go back regularly for their drinks, I wasn't even upset about the food, but now I will never go back and encourage my friends to go to the bubble tea place down the street instead. If you're in the area I would recommend Chatime or Magic Idea
The best bubble tea place in Montréal hands down. This is the only place I've been to in MTL that uses fresh ingredients for their drinks for around the same price as other bbt places (other bbt places uses powder). The food is authentic Taiwanese and comparable to the ones I've been to in Toronto and Vancouver. The vibe is also pretty awesome--it's a loft style with high ceilings, which is different from the other bbt places in MTL.
They sell pricey bubble teas and the food is average but I still go because of the taro bubble tea. It's exceptional. Once you get hooked you won't go back.
Place was loud with lots of echo. We came for the bubble tea and was surprised with all the choices! The menu was wrinkled on a clipboard and portions were small. Everything was a bit pricey too. Overall taste of product was o.k. for the price.
Come here often for a bite and some milk tea
I had no idea what to expect going into this restaurant as this was my first experience with taiwanese food but man what a treat this was! They had a stacked list of teas to try hot cold or with boba. Our waiter was great and of course the best thing about the place...The food!! I ordered G05 on the menu which was the traditional taiwanese spicy beef noodle dish which was amazing (not like Vietnam pho because the broth is completely different). My mom got the taiwanese popcorn chicken and it was amazing too! Nothing like American popcorn chicken because I think they mince it first and spiced it very differently. Im so glad my mom spotted this gem because it was a great experience.  Everything we got was delightful and we will definitely be going back.
Best bubble tea. Try the taro, it's amazing with no chalky taste that many places have from the favoring powders.
Exceptional Taiwanese cuisine, great tea, and a casual atmosphere. Need I say more?The food: authentic, flavourful, fresh. The noodles: Homemade. The tea: loose leaf in many flavours from all around the world (Try Taiwanese red teas, they are amazing).The atmosphere is friendly, sort of cafe like but welcoming. Their bubble tea is one of the best in town, not-from-powder(unless you want that). The dishes are fairly small, except the noodle ones. So it's best to order 3 for two people. Personally my favourite is the homestyle Taiwanese beef noodle!
tried the yuzu tea and a latte and really not great, the yuzu tea was way too sweet and tasted like concentrated juice and not tea... we went there after a meal already, so didnt order any food, but only drinks, we just wanted to chill there. but the atmosphere wasnt so great and the waitress was so rude and impatient, and just didnt seem to want us there..:( it will never go back there again
Their lavender bubble tea is amazing along with the Taiwanese fries, but very pricey!
There is such a huge selection of tea here, it's fantastic. I had never had taro tea, but was told it was a favorite. I understand why:) each tea the four of us shared was fantastic. The key is to not get the Westernized bubble tea where they use the powder. We didn't try the food, but maybe next time:)
I really like the bubble tea and mains here. I've had their popcorn chicken dish and taiwanese sausage dish. Both come with delicious salad. Oh and their sweet potato fries are really good as well, but be warned it tastes more like a dessert! I always order the same bubble tea flavor which is original milk tea, and I have sometimes been disappointed by some bubble tea joints. But Nos The makes it pretty well. I've had it with small bubbles and I think it's better than the normal bubbles!  I would give Nos The a 5 , but my boyfriend's dishes were on and off, the ones he chose. And also service is very slow on certain days because I think they are understaffed.  I think they need to have 2 people behind the counter. Kitchen I think is okay because food comes fairly quickly once it's ordered. But when it comes to getting the order taken, it's too long. Try this place for bubble tea if you're in the downtown area (specifically near Guy metro), and hopefully you will be lucky that it's not a full house!
This is the best place to go for real bubble tea. They make bubble tea out of real tea and fruit sorbet, instead of nasty powdered flavors (they still have powder, so ask for sorbet bubble tea, always).It is true that their food menu is not as good, but I go there for their bubble tea and special drinks!They can customize your drinks to anything you want. They have a lot of choices too.
GAHH I wish this place existed when I was a student in Montreal!! Nestled right in the Concordia area, this Taiwanese cafe sits conveniently on the corner of st. mathieu and Lincoln. There were two women working the counter taking orders and making the drinks when I walked in. Since my friend and I had been walking around all day, we wanted to sit down at a table and order a snack. You can certainly order things to go though. I am Taiwanese and grew up drinking bubble tea. This place offers an incredibly wide selection of teas, mostly freshly made. There is a small selection of powdered flavors, but why would you choose that when you can get the real stuff? Like all tea/beverage stands or shops in Taiwan, you can adjust the sweetness and ice level to your liking. I had the passion fruit tea, half sugar, and less ice which was perfect. The tapioca pearls were also cooked perfectly. I can't comment on the food since we only ordered their Japanese croquettes which were perhaps a bit under seasoned but still good.  I would definitely order it again. If only I still lived in Montreal, I would definitely be a regular!
We enjoyed the food for the most part.  Their Taiwanese sausage was great, leaner meat with right amount of spice.  Salt and pepper chicken was soft not crunchy, not the style we love. Sweet potatoes were very unique; chicken legs were not flavorful.  We went in during the busy time; the service was on the slow side.
Before I got here, I was told that I would be amazed by the quality of food from this establishment. The restaurant fell short of my expectations. We were promptly seated and we each ordered a beverage. I got the chocolate bubble tea, and it was pretty good. However, the food service is a bit slow. While we received our appetizer (sweet potato fries, very good by the way), the rest of the main dishes came late and not all together. In fact, I was done eating my meal a long ahead of time before my friend got hers. I ordered the Japanese curry with fried pork filet. First off, the dish was slightly cold, the breading not flavorful, lack of seasoning on the curry, but the pork cooked just right. I doubled checked the breading by sampling my friend's fried chicken, but it was the same lackluster quality. All in all, I think this place may be great on a snack level (bubble tea + appetizer), but don't raise your expectations too high for the main course.
My Taiwanese friend introduced me to this place and now I wish it was closer to home so I could go every week... at least. I've always adored Taiwanese cuisine and this one is definitely a jewel among the plethora of Asian restaurants in the Concordia ghetto. I went there during very late in the afternoon, so it wasn't very busy and the food arrived in what seemed like less than 5 minutes. I had the fried chicken cutlet with rice, which may sound like something on a kids' menu, but it was sooo much more than a fried chicken cutlet with rice. First of all, the chicken breast meat is good in itself,no doubt having been marinated in some magical Taiwanese concoction. Then, it is wrapped in this rice krispy like batter and very nicely fried so that it's crunchy but not at all oily. The plate came with a giant serving of both fresh salad and pickled vegies, served with delicious dressing. The dressing could be a tad sweet for some people, but it's totally right up my alley. I had the time of my life dfinishing my meal. Drinks wise, I chose the honey green tea with tapioca bubbles. It's fantastic! The drink is a bit more expensive than those at other bubble tea pkaces, but no doubt it's because they use real tea leaves. Another plus!
Best bubble tea in Montreal
best bubble tea  in Montreal for now
AMAZING BUBBLE TEA! I've spent the last five months scouting Montreal for the best bubble tea, and Nos Thés is hands-down the winner. Great assortment of teas! The food is amazing, albeit a little pricey, but I just go for the killer appetizers and tea!The only thing I want to note is that there are two different locations in Montreal and the atmosphere is very different depending on which place you go to. The Saint Catherine one near Beaudry metro is very sleek and stylish with padded booths and faux-grass walls and it is larger, so it tends to feel less crowded. On the other hand,  the Saint Mathieu location is basement-level and feels like a cozy, independent coffee/tea place with mis-matched decor and magazines in stacks for you to browse. It also gets pretty cramped when it's busy and doesn't seem to have as much staff as the Beaudry location. Either way, you get the same great menu, so you can't go wrong!UPDATE 10/2014: Nos Thes on Saint Mathieu has now moved to a swanky new location next to Concordia on West Saint Catherine! Their new place is adorable and modern, but has the same delicious tea and food!
I'm from NYC and still these bagels are high on my list! The sesame bagel is mass-produced here for good reason. If you go before noon, the sesame bagels are freshly made constantly, so you can get one and eat it fresh and hot out of the oven. I personally like the everything bagel the most and think that if you can bring it home to toast it would be just as good if not better than the sesame one. What makes these bagels special is that they're covered with toppings all over, not just on one side.
After conducting exhaustive and delicious study,  I'm going to boldly state this is my second favourite bagel place in Montreal.   I realize that may be highly contested but St. Viateur was edged out only slightly.  It's still tasty though. If you are seeking the best St Viateur go here... and don't be tricked by the other location down the street which is just a cafe with the same name.This place is busy... cash only... and when you get to the front of the line you better know what you want and have cash in hand or the staff will be extremely rude.  My plans were foiled because they were out of a couple of my choices which resulted in last minute mental reorg and if looks could kill I probably wouldn't be writing this review. On a return trip I probably would just buy whatever is hot.  The colder bagels were good but honestly nothing worth a long wait for.  Maybe if my first choices were there I might think differently... but I only can only go on what I was given.
Amazing bagels for sure, but they go from fresh to stale within literally an hour.  Eat them straight out of the wood burning oven for max enjoyment, and they won't even need butter or cream cheese.HOWEVER.  This is why I take a star away.  They can't be bothered to deal with any of the cream cheese or additional toppings, making it highly annoying when you want to treat it as a breakfast when on the go..  Frustrating, because not everybody is taking it directly home, especially us out of towners!Besides, surely they are missing out on additional profits by being so stubborn
GET A SESAME BAGEL. comes out piping hot from the oven, fresher than fresh, and gorgon inside and crisp on outside. Wow. So good. I started with a flaxseed to be healthy. But when hubby got a sesame we went back for second round with only sesame. Yes that's the one to get. Best bagel we both ever had
The busy atmosphere and the wood burning oven tell it all. Montreal bagels must use a wood burning oven to be authentic. The bagels are fairly priced $10 for 12 bagels. For handmade and fresh bagels. They have nothing to hide they place all their ingredients stocked high in front of their store from the flour they use to the dough they make. Everything is open for you to see to make an honest bagel.
I like the setting of the shop where you can see how they make the bagel. It's also really cool to see the mountain pile of bagels coming out of the oven. Not sure if this is the best bagel ever, and I still have to decide if I like the honey sweetness in Montreal bagels. Still, the chewyness of the bagel is top notch and better than most bagels I have had in the US!
Bagel mastery. Bagel gods. Bagel mafia? Maybe. Bagel artisans. Bagel angels. Bagel dreams. Prepare for bagel serious dreams. Sesame - the classic. Get it hot to experience true gluten perfection. So pillowy. It will melt in your mouth which defies science. You will fall in bagel love and all other bagels will never compare.
These bagels are my favorite among many delicious options in Montreal. First off, they've got a rustic morphology to them - the bagels are heterogeneously shaped and have this nutty aroma (if you go with the recommended sesame version). The ovens have clearly been loved and taken care of for decades, likely adding to the interesting finish. Second, the bakers are focused on one thing - making excellent bagels and providing fast and efficient service. Now who can't appreciate that?!
This place is everything. It's for your midnight cravings after you had 5 beers at a Mile-End bar (accompanied with hummus or cream cheese), or is your company for the breakfast next day, or just an afternoon snack because why not. You probably heard of the rivalry between Fairmont. To me, St-Viateur's softer bite will dominate the other one's harder shell any day.
Legend has it that there is a bagel shop in Montreal that rivals even the best of the best bagels in NYC.  Well my Jewish bretheren, look no further for all the stories you heard of as a child are true -- St Viateur has some baller bagels that can induce uncontrollable salivation simply upon perception of their fragrant smell.Tons of flavors, a reasonable price and memories that will last a lifetime. No combos, just bagels in their purest form.  You can get some spreads from the freezer and they have plastic knives available for those on the go.  It was worth my $30 CAD cab ride to get them before I left Canada.  Or this could just be the hangover from the bachelor party talking.
Internationally known and locally respect St-Viateur is for the real bagel P.I.M.P.S. Shout-out to all my hooligans in Brooklyn, but Smoke Meat and Bagels are an OG Montreal thing.Must visit bagel shop in MTL.
Had to try these when visiting Montreal! I enjoyed these more than Fairmont bagels. They were crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside with a almost sweet aftertaste. Very different than the NYC bagels I am used to. I'm glad I gave them a try! When in Rome! I don't need to go back but I would recommend this to people visiting Montreal for sure!
Good price. Amazing quality. And delicious bagels. I bought 4... 2 for lunch and 2 for breakfast in the morning, along with some cream cheese, and peanut butter and jelly. Very friendly and quick service. The bagels are as good as people say. I'm coming back in the next couple days for another round. If you're in the neighbourhood or visiting Montreal, don't miss these bagels!
Yep, just as I thought. I bought bagels from both St-Viateur and Fairmount. I tasted them, unidentified from which shop. It's impossible to tell them apart! Here's my therory: It's like that TWIX chocolate bar commercial. Two brothers got into a quarrel and decided to open their own bagel shop. They are equally convinced that theirs are better. While in fact, it's probably the same recipe.
It really feels more like a bagel factory (so so many bagels). It can be a bit overwhelming if you don't live in Montreal. The line to the cashier goes really fast, so you don't have much time to decide. You can get hummus, cream cheese, and other spreads from the fridge right next to the line. They also have little to-go cream cheese and strawberry jam that you can grab from the fridge right in front of the cashier (it's on the lowest shelf so it might be hard to see). They give you plastic knives if you need them.It's efficient and quick (no seats), perfect for breakfast on the go or just picking up bagels for the rest of the week. I got the rosemary bagel and it was wonderful. I was disappointed that we visited the last morning we were in Montreal so we couldn't go again. I would definitely come back another time!
OH! Such a cute place with delicious bagels! The Montreal bagel is quite different from the New York bagel I've known all my life, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The bagel sandwich combos are delicious with a very reasonable price point to match. I wouldn't buy the cream cheese or other items in their fridge -- that is rather overpriced. However, when buying just bagels, it is extremely well priced, particularly when considering the taste!Just be sure to bring cash -- they don't take credit.
Hands down the best bagels I've had in my life.  And mind you, I lived in New York City one summer.I'm used to gross bagels that are dense and tasteless as hockey pucks, and I've always hated them and avoided them.I feel like I've finally found out what bagels are supposed to taste like.  I don't really know how you can beat their bagels.  They hand make them with all natural ingredients, poach them in honey water, and bake them in wood ovens.  When you get the bagels, they are fresh and piping hot.I've heard people complain that the bagels are too sweet.  I'm generally on a keto diet so I'm very sensitive to sugar, and I have no problems with these bagels.  Speaking of the keto diet - I'm glad I don't have these back home as I wouldn't be on the keto diet anymore. They're so delicious.  Anyways - definitely go.  The bagels are cheap, service is great, and they are open 24/7.  What more could you ask for?
So so bagel sandwiches. Not worth going out of way for. Flavours mediocre. Packed to the brim, definitely not worth waiting for.
If you've never been to Montreal and love bagels, this is the place to go.  Bagels are baked fresh on wooden boards in a wood fired oven 24/7.  Most of the time they are still warm when they bag them for you. There's nothing like a Montreal Bagel.  I always bring 3 or 4 dozen home.  You can freeze them and then defrost and toast them. Once you try these, you'll be hooked.
Food- This is a must when you visit Montreal- Its a 24hr joint- Bagels are always being made fresh- At night, the selection is limited, but regardless the bagels are amazing- Bet you can't just eat one- Great selection of cream cheese and dips as well- Prices are great tooService- No complaints and for it being late, the staff was pleasant to deal with
St. Viateur Bagel Shop proffers an admirable simplicity. Bagels (mostly sesame) are served warm from a giant metal sluice that sits next to a table where an aproned man whacks and shapes dough he then shoves, on large trays, into the oven (whence they spill forth via the sluice). There's a refrigerator case stocked with bagel-angled groceries: many varieties of cream cheese, two or three of capers, half a dozen smoked salmon options, and several salmon spreads; a few jams, butter, and some stuff we failed to note. There's another small refrigerator with non-alcoholic drinks. The drawback is that the bagels suck. "Suck" is too strong, but we'd been advised that Montréal's bagel scene rivals New York's, and that turns out to be a lunatic's delusion. In flavor, this dough isn't far from a simple street pretzel. What a street pretzel has that these bagels lack, of course, is a thick pelt of salt. Any flavor you get at St. Viateur comes from that refrigerator. The bagels give you a warm smooshy vessel for salmon, cheese, jam, etc., thus fulfilling only the most rudimentary function of a bagel. It was late, though; we had played a show and everything else was closed; and so we fell onto the St. Viateur bagels like half-starved hyenas stumbling across an unguarded scrum of newborn kittens (must happen sometimes). Given the strictly-takeout nature of the spot, that meant huddling around a tiny ersatz picnic blanket of paper bags on the sidewalk out front, scooping and spreading cream cheese and sawing salmon with little plastic knives no stiffer than stir sticks. There's something attractive about the rudimetary nature of these bagels. Like inchoate little vertebrates crawling out of the sea on their journey to articulated limbs and teeth and wings, St. Viateur's product arouses in the modern mammal an instinctive gratitude. That's not to say, though, we'd ever elect willingly to shed our teeth and thumbs, our poppy seeds and garlic and swirls of pumpernickel.
I  have lived and eaten bagels in New York for 23 years of my life.  I know I will get sh** for saying this but the bagel I had from St Viateur was the best bagel of my life and it haunts my dreams every night. I has a sesame bagel with lime and coriander cream cheese.  I shared it with my boyfriend, which I regret.  If I ever come back to Montreal I will have many of these bagels and will not share with anyone.
Tasty, bustly bagel shop in the heart of Montreal's student district. Had the 'traditional' bagel sandwich, with lox and all the fixings. Savory green salad on the side. Open brick oven right in the restaurant. Yum! Speedy service. Two things would have made lunch even better: more than just a few poppy seeds on the outside of the bagel, and a moister, chewier bagel.
Some of the staff needs a lesson on customer service. Their arrogance is really not necessary. Their bagels are really good and stay fresh for a long time which is nice if you want to take a bag home with you.
St Viateur bagels are an iconic Montreal food and there's a good reason for that. These are possibly the World's Best Bagels and most certainly North America's Best Bagels. Enter the bagel shop: stoked up brick oven at the back, with a slew of guys rolling and baking fresh bagels on the spot, just for you. Bagels are slid into the long oven all lined up on a plank, turned once or twice and then pulled out, piping hot. It's an eat-in diner type of spot, with a little side counter if you're just there to grab a bag of fresh bagels and go. I've done both. Nothing says 'weekend' like a hot, fresh, sesame seed encrusted St Viateur bagel with a coffee for breakfast. They've got a fridge full of cream cheeses, smoked salmon and spreads next to the takeout bagel counter, too, in case you wanted to try something new. Pleasant staff, good vibes - definitely one of my regular stops on Mont Royal.
Located in neighborhood of Mile End in the borough of Le Plateau Mont-Royal, St-Viateur Bagel has been makin bagels for over 55 years. They claim to be the longest running bagel shop in Montreal.  They just do 9 kinda bagels, (Sesame, Poppy, Plain, Whole Wheat, Rosemary, Cinnamon Rasin, Multigrain, Flax & All dressed) and boy are they delicious.  Sorry NY friends, But New York doesn't make Bagels as good as St Viateur's. No place to sit here. You buy your bagels, pay (Cash only) & Walk out.  You hardly walk half a block and then you notice "a glitch in the Matrix" Deja Vu............There's another St-Viateur Bagel on the other side of the roadMy point is..... The Bagel's are awesome
I don't know how to really write a long review here because this place is simple and to the point.Delicious, fresh bagels at a super decent price. That's it! They also sell juices, water, and soft drinks as well as cream cheeses (even individual packets), hummus, and yogurt.It's definitely a place I try to stay away from, but on nights when we do go, it's bagelmania. Why do I stay away if it's so good? Because, unlike those lucky ones among us who can inhale 5 bagels a day and not gain a pound, all I need to do is just look at one, and I feel my jeans tighten..... But really, go. If you like bagels, you'll like this place!
Sesame bagel was warm and fresh. The three topping sesame garlic and poppy was a little stiff though. Might have been better if it was warmed up. Nonetheless great bagels!!!!
A lot has been said about NY vs Montreal bagels. I want to say that while there are similarities, these are not the same. Montreal bagels are sweeter and denser. St-Viateur Bagel is a great place. What they do is make and sell bagels. You walk up, pick what you want, and leave. They sell cream cheese and will give you a knife. They also sell salmon. They do not make sandwiches for you - think H&H in NYC and you get the picture.The line moves quickly, and you are treated to watching the people shape the bagels and cook them in the wood-fired oven as you wait. If you are a fan of trying local foods and don't mind a slight detour out of the normal touristed areas, this should be on your schedule of things to do while in Montreal.
Best bagels I've ever had. The end.But actually. Bagels are such a simple thing that're sold everywhere, but no one really does them quite as well as St. Viateur. Also the place is open 24 hrs. That's freaking fantastic. High quality bagels at any hour of the night!!They've got quite a number of flavors and options, but I honestly think the plain bagel is the best bagel. The thing about this bagel that differentiates it from other bagels out there is in the dough itself. While normal bagels need cream cheese to accentuate and even flavor the bagel, even the plain bagel can stand alone when it's being eaten here. It's got its own unique taste and god it is fantastic. St. Viateur also has quite the extensive collection of cream cheese, toppings, drinks, etc and yeah it's pretty awesome.But actually. Best bagels I've ever had. I was struggling when I was reading the reviews between this place and the other place, but I honestly have to say that I have probably not ever had a bagel better than the ones that I've had here. This is no exaggeration. Friends got the cinnamon and sesame ones which I think were fine, but you gotta go plain.tldr; best bagels ever, go plain.
Let me preface this review by saying that I'm a born and bred New Yorker and know a get bagel when I bite into it. With that being said, this was one of the most delicious bagels I've ever had...EVER!I was given the name of this bagel shop by friend who had once been. She told me that they're not your traditional bagels, so I'll admit that I was a bit hesitant. The location to which we went was jam-packed but waiting on line was a pleasure. My friend and I were able to watch the bagels get baked in the back, and it was absolutely fascinating. It was like being at a museum, but better - you could actually touch...and eat...everything you saw! I kept it simple with an everything bagel with vegetable cream cheese. The bagel was warm, crispy, and absolutely mouth-watering. It was so good, I was tempted to go back and get another dozen. I wish I had known ahead of time that you could sit down and enjoy a meal here. I would've enjoyed picking some other items off their menu!Please, if you're in Montreal, hunt down one of their locations; you won't be disappointed in the piece of heaven you're about to enjoy!
$0.75 per bagel.  Choose from sesame, poppy seeds or plain!  Employees even offer to take pictures with you :)
What a great experience! I've been wanting to visit here for years. I wasn't sure what to expect as I'm accustomed to Vermont bagel shops, where most order toasted and with cream cheese. You basically order your bagels to go, 1 to many dozen. You can grab a cream cheese to from the cooler. I asked about coffee and the lady at counter said we can get an awesome latte and eat our bagels down the street at Cafe Olympica. Which is what we did. Our bagels were fresh and warm, right out of the wood fired oven! We pulled them apart and dipped them in the tub of Greek cream cheese I bought. I do you think it was funny that they had to Philly cream cheese as an option considering we were in Montreal and what looked like a Greek/Jewish community. We brought home six with us and two days later they're all gone but one I wish I had more. Next time I will be buying a couple dozen to split and freeze at home. A little out-of-the-way but definitely a classic Montreal must taste!
*single tear*Wow, so disappointing! At 11:30am on a Sunday we grabbed 3 of these supposedly famous bagels to enjoy outside with our yummy lattes from Cafe Olimpico down the street. Our order: 1 sesame, 1 poppy, 1 everything...and 3 mini cream cheese packets. A recipe for deliciousness, no? NO. The bagels were cold, hard, nothing special at all.Were they having an off day? Perhaps. Still.....*single bagel tear*....very disappointing. Next time I would request "WARM bagels" if I were you :)(Bagel tips for Toronto: my favourite light fluffy bagels come from Gryfe's on Bathurst; my favourite Montreal-style bagels come from Bagel House on Avenue Rd).
Best bagel of my life!Dragged a friend with me through the snow for a bagel.Fresh hot sesame bagels with salmon pâté! Smaller and less dense than a NYC bagel, a crispy on the outside. The salmon pâté was a flavor bomb, and I would take it over lox cream cheese any day.Their bagels are not as tasty cold, so definitely go for what ever bagel is coming out of the oven.
Great sesame bagel. Tastes like Chinese style fried dough balls when eaten fresh, but the resemblance goes away within 15 min as it cools down.To try: other bagels, fresh or at room temp.
The sesame bagels are sooo delicious, tastier than any bagel I've had at home in NYC. I really wanted to try the other varieties but once I tried the sesame, I was hooked. During my 4.5 day long trip to Montreal, I had bagels from St Viateur a total of 3 times. Highly recommend.
Best bagels in the world - better than New York better than Toronto - just come get 1 from the wooden stove and ask for cream cheese and plastic knife - so u can open it up and eat just outside the store. Amazing
Make sure to be there when the bagels are fresh out of the over and hot. You're gonna love it.Also open all night, so you can snack on bagels at 4AM if you feel like it.
My coworker is from Montreal and lives near here.  When we dined nearby, he said we HAD to stop afterwards and get some "montreal bagels".  I was kinda full from the meal, but I went along.  He bought a dozen to take back to his family and he bought another half-dozen for me to take back to the office the next day.Let me describe this place as "an authentic, ethnic bagel shop".  There is little fanfare or decor, except the sign that says they have been open since 1957.  After one bite (mind you it was next morning), I can see why my coworker says there is a line out the door most times.These guys handmake bagels and cook them in a wood-fired oven - by the hundreds.  The pricing is so cheap (the 18 bagels were $11CAD I think).  I had seasame seed and he got poppyseed.  They also sell cream cheese and salmon fixins.  Honestly the bagels are so good they don't need anything (I didn't even toast mine).When I showed up at the office the next day and offered up my six bagels, I was lucky to snag one before they disappeared in 2 minutes.  Next time I am in the area, I am definitely going back
PERFECTION! It almost seems ridiculous to write a review about an institution like St. Viateur but I guess there's still people out there that haven't had a bagel (or 6) from here. If you're not familiar with Montreal bagels or bagel shops you may be a little surprised. St Viateur is a 24hr bagel shop, they sell bagels, cream cheese and little else. There's no ordering your bagel as a sandwich, no selection of cream cheese flavors mounding in the case, no fried eggs on them, I'm not sure they even sell coffee there ... and there's no seating, this isn't a dining destination, you order and then leave, you can stand on the sidewalk or find a bench nearby to eat. It's not unusual to eat outside or walk around the Mile End area window shopping with a bagel in hand.  The selection of bagels always includes sesame and then, seemingly random, there might be an everything, a rosemary or a cinnamon raisin, but sesame is the mainstay. Liberte cream cheese is available in the case and is typically limited to regular and low fat. Bagels are continuously being made here at all hours of the day and night, they're pulled from the oven and piled high, still warm. When you order the bagels will still be warm (they're always warm and should be eaten warm). The technique is to grab a container of cream cheese and your bagels and then "rip and dip" as I like to say. I had a discussion with some coworkers, most of them, like me, rip the bagels up and dip them in the tub of cream cheese like a dip. I've heard of people cutting them up but Montreal bagels aren't really suited for making sandwiches with. There's some debate between St Viateur vs Fairmont bagels, my preference is St Viateur as they're typically less "done" than Fairmont making them a little more chewy and soft. St Viateur always seems to have more sesame which gives them a nice nuttiness.
This place is the most bare-bones, to the point bakery in the world. Don't expect some sort of trendy looking place selling overpriced baked goods. You're here for the bagels, and if you're stuck needing bagel accessories, they have those too.If you're not familiar with Montreal-style bagels, they're not what most people are used to. Most people are familiar with the New York style. Montreal-style bagels are smaller with crispy and sweet crust and a lighter overall texture. They're simply phenomenal with a nice schmeer of cream cheese, and don't even need toasting in any form to be excellent.They're sold at a few locations around Montreal (I bought more at the Marche Jean-Talon before leaving town) but getting them right out of the massive wood fired oven at the source on St-Viateur is so much better.
The best bagels in the world. Period! You might think you know bagels, but until you've had one fresh from the oven with cream cheese you'll see that you were sorely mistaken. In fact, one can never really say that they've lived until they've had a fresh st-vie bagel. Honest.
St-Viateur Bagel Shop is an Institution it's that good. Since 1957, 24/7 they've been pumping out amazing Bagels, selling over 1000 a day.   I've been coming here since I was really young and I remember  Joe the owner was always cracking jokes and let me make my own bagel, dip it in the Honey Water and put it in the wood burning furnace, and get to eat some dough.. Yumm.   This place is just the best and the workers love their job and put Love into the Bagel, that's why it's that tasty. It's light and Crunchy on the outside, chewy inside, delicately sweet, and depending on your preference the Poppy, Sesame, Plain, All Dressed all have different overall tastes to them, so pick your Fav! Also they have a good selection of cream cheese, Hummus, butter, and beverages if you plan on having a Picnic.   My favourite is the Sesame seed Bagel fresh from the oven, just plain.  When buying the dozen ( or more) and bring it home , cut them in half and freeze them. That way you just pop the frozen bagel halves in the toaster and it comes out tasting fresh. Their website also offers info.  I also strongly suggest bringing the Montreal Bagels on your trips, they make great gifts. The Montreal Pierre Trudeau Airport when flying International offers the  St-Viateur Bagels in sandwiches and Bagels for sale by the half Dozen/ Dozen, so if you forget or don't have time to pick up your presents, here's your chance!  Yes I love this place and will be back as long as its still making Fresh Montreal Bagels.  This is a place I would take my kids when I have them.** Featured on The Layover , Antony Boudain Recommends: St-Viateur Bagel Shop"One of the best examples of the local style (of bagels), St-Viateur's hand-rolled, wood fire-baked, using the same Eastern European recipe they brought over half a century ago. They're very, very good."  **
Great bagels and are a tie-in with Fairmount bagels for me. Hot out of the oven.
Montreal's bagels. everyone telling me about how good they are.... so I guess visiting St Viateur is on top of my to do list for my weekend in Montreal.This location is the first I visited. Nothing fancy here, bagels... and more bagels.For this afternoon only plain, sesame and poppy seeds are available. We also pick up some smoked salmon spread to go with them.If you love your bagels dense, heavy and sweet... these babies are for you!
Poppy seed bagel, 0.75 each. Smells so good!!!! Soft and yummy : ) I love this area!!!!!!!
Bare bones bagel operation that's been around for 60+ years and it's absolute perfection - what more do you need than a huge wall of dough, some honey sweetened water in which to boil the shaped dough, and a huge wood fire oven for baking? Every bagel is served hot and fresh and ready for consumption. The bagged kind just doesn't compare to getting one hot out of the oven, but once you toast them they get perfectly crunchy again. You can buy cream cheese by the packet (or tub, if you're me). There just isn't anything quite like a Montreal style bagel. It's open 24/7 and they pump out 12,000 bagels PER DAY at this location. Surreal!
Got the recommendation from our hotel as one of the best places for bagels - definitely these bagels were delicious and are no comparison to what you buy at a chain grocery store. We bought a variety including cinnamon raisin, everything, and rosemary (my favorite). The texture is chewier. Glad we stopped by. Friendly and quick service.
3.5 (0.5 is for their prices)Some nut rated this place and five and said they were better than NY bagels. BLASPHEMY!!!!I know Montreal bagels are thinner, have a larger hole, and are prepped differently than NY/NJ bagels, but honest to goodness, NY/NJ bagels are on a whole other level! I find Montreal bagels so much harder to eat. Where is the surface area to spread the cream cheese? And where's the doughy interior? What kind of 'All Dressed' (or what we Americans called an 'Everything') does not have salt on them? =(But for what they are this place was good, prices are excellent, the amount of cream cheese/hummus/butter spread selections is great. Drinks too.I was able to walk out of there with a dozen bagels, a large orange juice and some Liberty cream cream for less than $18. Not bad. I must say their cream cheese is way better than Philadelphia. Will I come back? I'm not too sure. Maybe if I was stranded in Canada and not just visiting for the weekend.In a perfect world, Liberte Cream Cheese on NY/NJ bagel.
We walked in, bought an assorted dozen, walked out and headed for the airport. We froze the bagels as soon as we got home and there are still a couple left (it has been a month). The one that we toasted yesterday still tastes as wonderful as the first one we ate. These bagels may be the best food we got in Montreal.
Most Montrealers are St-Viateur fans or Fairmount fans.  Personally I fall into the St-Viateur category.  They have a small selection of flavours but I prefer it that way.   I'm also a fan of the wood-burning oven they use to make them as well as the fact that they boil them in honey water.  I always load up on sesame seed and poppy seed bagels when I'm in the area.  The best part too  is that they make them all day long so they're usually very fresh when you pick them up.  It's next to impossible not to eat one on the way home and your car is filled with the aroma of freshly baked bagels as you drive home.
Solid bagel shop, but a bit too sweet and some of the bagels were a little stale (not fresh?) and doughy.
Really very good bagels and thats coming from someone who was born and raised in NY. There really is no comparison because the texture is extremely different and Montreal bagels need to be appreciated for what they are.We ordered the traditional bagel which had lox, capers and onions on it. It was perfectly toasted and came with a small cup of soup or salad. We enjoyed our breakfast bagel so much that we bought 6 more to go-- eating them for lunch and dinner on our drive back to NYC from Montreal. My favorites are the sesame seed and the cinnamon raisin. I still love my NYC bagels and like that I dont have to toast them to enjoy them but I can appreciate Montreal bagels and their distinct taste. I will be craving them sometime soon!
There is a reason Montreal bagels are famous. Make sure to ask for a hot one, ooh my goodness the best bagel I've ever had!
Heard rave reviews about this place and had to try it.  We had our 2 year old with us and he got to see how bagels were made.  We ate everything bagels fresh out of the oven with simple cream cheese and it was delicious.  They have your choice of various cream cheeses or hummus to purchase.  Prices were affordable and the bagels lived up to expectations.  Highly recommended, plan on grabbing another dozen before we leave!  Cash only.
Off we went walking 2 kilometers in the cold for some Bagels 'cause we had Coupons.These better be some wacked out Rum soaked Belly Dancing Holy Moley Bagels.Alas, we arrived to this Bagel Shop looking like we just finished running the Ironman.At least we stumped the Bakers just standing still doing absolutely nothing...Except we waited for our Coupon Lady to show up.  Coupon not for this location???Our attempt to stuff this Coupon Lady into the Open Oven didn't work.We PAID for the assorted variety of Bagels and back the 2 km we crawled.What must have been 45 minutes after we left the shop, we arrived at the Hotel.We spread the Daily Offerings on the table and we feasted like nobody's business.These Bagels are fussy to say the least as it changes molecularly after being Frozen.The very best was this very first tasting sliced in half with Smoked Salmon on top.Unforgetable aroma of Sesame, crunch of the crust, interior dough soften by Salmon.The distinct sweetness of St Viateur Bagel balances saltiness of the Smoked Salmon.That's how you know you don't have any ordinary Bread underneath Smoked Salmon.You have a St Viateur Sesame Bagel.
I grew up on these. They are my late-night drunk food. They are the go-to's that I bring on weekend trips and brunches. No other bagel can compare to the awesomeness of a St-Viateur sesame seed bagel. Especially when fresh, piping hot and slathered in cream cheese.
A must-go when visiting Montréal. Amazing bagels. All the flavors are great but the Rosemary Olive Oil Sea Salt is my fav.
Ambrosia.   With the fresh cream cheese they sell in store there are few better food experiences on the planet.  To walk in at any hour and get one of these fresh out of the stone oven is a must have experience. I go here every time I am in Montreal and always bring a dozen back for others.
My first breakfast in the city of Montreal was spent here. It was a superb choice. I highly recommend the cinnamon chai tea as it was excellently made.I ordered the ham, egg, and cheese bagel sandwich with a side salad. The salad took a little getting used to but the bagel was a trophy in and of itself!
I don't think I've ever eaten almost three bagels in one sitting. That's wrong, right? I mean, people eat 2,3,4, donuts in one sitting, so why not bagels? I'm just comparing shapes here, people. I have to say though, the only place that has ever led me to the verge of gluttony was St. Viateur Bagel Shop. I really don't enjoy pointing fingers, but I have to blame them for giving me my two dozen while they were still warm. This just set me up for a downward spiral of bagel shame. They are just so delicious you can't eat just one when they are that fresh! However, when they are a day or two old, I can easily refrain from eating more than my standard serving of one. The bagels are made fresh at the shop every day, and you can even spy on the dudes in the back working away. Made there, sold there - plain, poppy seed, whole wheat, sesame seed, cinnamon raisin - stop me now! Grab a dozen or two and you're set for at least a week...unless of course you're weak like me...and you keep telling yourself, "Just one more...then I'll stop." Addictions are bad.
They really are that good. So is watching them come out piping hot from the oven. I ate mine still warm, nothing on it, soooo good.Go here for the best bagels. Enough said.
This was a fun breakfast stop during an October trip to Montreal. It was neat seeing the bagels being thrown into a pile after being freshly made. I enjoyed my bagel, though the taste was different from a NY bagel - growing up on Long Island, those were my default bagels, so I may be biased. I did enjoy the option of a rosemary bagel though. I would say this place is worth a stop overall if you're in the area or don't mind traveling a bit off the beaten path. I would give it a 3.5 if I could.
Came here to try the hyped up bagels.  I tried a sesame bagel. Unfortunately, the sesame seeds were were bad.  I took one bite and was very disappointed.  Took another bite as I coudn't beleve it and that was it. Trashed the rest.
They're different that's for sure.  Maybe I'm just a NYC bagel kinda guy, but I don't see what all the fuss is about.  They're dense, hard, and have a different texture from NYC bagels, a bit grainier I think... they're okay.  Sorry Canada.
very simple great fresh bagels made on site.you can see and talk to the guys making the bagels.order a dz. to bring back. these are great bagel not better than NYC but totally different.must stop and have one there's alway room for bagels!
The best bagel I've ever had. Ever. The warm sesame is crusty, soft, chewy, airy, slightly sweet and only $0.70. These blow NYC bagels out of the water. And I was initially a skeptic about this. Go here!!!
Friendly waitstaff, delicious food and lots of deserts! Definitely try the tasty bagel sandwiches. You also have an option of salad or soup on the side included with the sandwich. Your trip to Montreal will not be complete without stopping here.
What's not to love? Fresh and hot right out of the oven sesame bagels that will make you cry with delight. Had them pack up a dozen or so for the trip home. Were they as good the next day? Not even close but hey that's life. I like that they sold individual servings of cream cheese so no need to have delayed gratification.
these bagels are not to be compared with any bagel i've ever had in the States or NYC - smaller around, & thinner, with a bigger hole.  So a bit like comparing apples & oranges ... but honestly, i think these were better.  THERE! I SAID IT!  Dense yet somehow light - the sesame seeds perfectly toasted - and .70 cents to boot.  unbelievable.  we picked up some liberté cream cheese - a pretty obviously gamble that it's going to be better than Philadelphia Cream Cheese - & a smoked salmon spread - & strolled up to Olimpico Cafe to eat them.  incredible.  we came back again & again our whole trip to montreal.
This is the wholesale bakery of the world famous St. Viateur Bagel Shop.  THEY ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLICIf you need to come up with serious dozens of fresh bagels in an instant - this is the place.  No, they don't have all of the nice little extras, but what did you REALLY come here for anyway?But wait - Hate to wait? On Saturday and Sunday morning when the lines are REALLY long at # 263, a leisurely stroll down the block will get you as many of those fresh hot beauties as you can carry!
I was a tourist, and on the first night my friend took me out to the bars and then to try the bagels. This is THE place for a bagel at any hour. No frills, as it should be.
that's a good bagel.
My dad lived in Montreal back in the 70's, and every time he comes to visit here, he gets roughly eight dozen bagels. If he knows he's getting bagels from St. Viateur, he'll often borrow my mom's minivan to drive up to Montreal, to make sure they'll all fit. We've had problems at the border, a lot of US agents who have never had the fortune of going to St. Viateur think we're smuggling drugs amongst all the bagels. But no, there's really just nearly 100 bagels in our trunk. They're that good.
Accustomed to my Brooklyn bagels, I was very interested in trying a Montreal bagel. I loved it! This shop is also cool because you get to see the making process. I definitely don't think Montreal and Brooklyn bagels are comparable, but could totally be put in different categories, each being their own type of delicious.
I think it's overrated. I've had better bagels. But it was still good!
I tried the everything bagel with salmon, cream cheese, tomatoes and capers.  It was the best bagel I've ever had.  It's also the only 11 dollar bagel I've ever had.  Service was great, they accommodated my group of 5 on a very busy Sunday.  It was a good brunch, sangria, bloody Marys and tons of bagels.  Very close to a 5 star rating.
My wife and I were in Montreal for the first time. Traffic was a nightmare, the public transportation system wasn't differently-abled-people friendly, and we hadn't brushed up on our French beforehand so communication was sometimes an issue.But Lafayette, which happened to be in walking distance of our B&B, was a Godsend. Normally when we travel we don't visit the same restaurant twice because we want to experience different things. This time we agreed we were getting dinner there on our second night too.The food was great. I just got poultine, but as far as comfort food goes Quebec has America beat. First night was plain old regular poultine, second night was the Lafayette poultine which was topped with hamburger and onions. My wife got the chicken macaroni one night (this may have been the Chinese macaroni other reviewers are talking about - the menu was French and I made my orders without knowing 100% what I was getting.) I didn't think at first it looked that appetizing, but after my wife wasn't able to finish it and I took care of the rest (in the interest of not wasting food) I conceded that it would be perfectly delicious for whenever I'd need a brief break from poultine.The service was attentive. When one of the waitresses had very limited English she didn't act put out by our lack of French. The price was very reasonable.I've had good tasting poultine dishes in British Columbia but Lafayette's seemed more authentic. Now if only we could take public transportation from Olympia, WA to Montreal, QC so I could try the Italian poultine.
I live right around the corner of this restaurant. Love the friendly service. The food is what you would expect in this kind of restaurant. Hamburgers, pitas, pizzas, submarines and of course their breakfast! Huge portions for the price. I really like the food there. I pretty much tried it all but my favourite is the chicken pita platter. I always order the double pita so i can have some for later! Lol! My husbands favourite are their pizzas. The breakfast and brunch is also quite good! I recommend this place to all!
Diner- great omelette & poutine fries.Came with cole slaw and mixed veggies.Nice meal.Crowd was interesting.
This was a great restaurant and the service was cordial. The portion sizes were very generous and the food was delicious. I highly recommend the chicken and butterfly shrimp.
The best comfort food I've had since like forever. The Smoked Meat Poutine was the  star, and the portion was gigantesque. The hot-dogs had mouth-watering slaws and pickled onions, and the chicken sandwich was really amazing as well.The service was really fast, and food came out really quick. The menu selection was huge, and everything seemed so tasty (okay maybe not the "Chinese Macaroni", that looked terrible).The place was very crowded and very loud, but the atmosphere is great! You feel like a Québécois the moment you enter the restaurant. And when you hear the waitress asks if you want your hot-dog "steamé" instead of "à la vapeur," you know you've come to the right place.
Consider this your typical diner with nothing fancy about it. i am a fan of places like this for the simple yet delicious food. Especially nice when you need to cure that hangover. The coffee and food are great for the price. Probably the best inexpensive diner in the area.
Gotta love me some old fashioned diner food late at night when it's freezing cold and Paté Chinois is on the daily special. My dining companion devoured the fried calamari and gives it a 7 out of 10 which, all things considered, is high praise. A special note, one of the 2 people sitting next to us asked for very burnt toast. The banter with the waitress was really sweet and they had a good laugh and...he got his very burnt toast! He was tickled pink. The place is so welcoming at 10PM on a cold evening and it's great to get service with a smile and a meal that's filling, tasty and really affordable.
Really good "cheap restaurant". Poutine, burgers... I recommend their chinese macaroni. Good breakfasts too... The waiters are really nice and friendly, the owners (greek) are joyful and everybody seems to love their job ! Nice place for a quick and non complicated meal !
This is a "go to"  for me and my man! The poutine is cheap, big and one of the best we have tried in town. Their pizza is actually really delicious too! The service is fantastic here, always. It's has a very American diner feel to it. Good variety, good service, good prices and tasty food!
A good place to go. A local fixture in the borough. Opens early for the breakfast. Usually closes at 11pm (used to be 1am)Has a full meal menu (including soup and desert) where you can eat for 14-16 dollars.
best diner around and its open early and stays open late. The breakfast there was phenomenal! Just like being back in the US.....well except that the waiter who spoke french and broken english was from mexico and not Montreal. It is amazing how many people we thought were local that came from somewhere else. Our waiter was one of them. the place was owned by greeks who know how to run diners (most diners in jersey are owned by greeks) The portions were generous and the ingredients fresh. the place was clean and bright and had 'tude. Love it. I am just sorry we didn't notice the place when we first arrived cause I would have just eaten there for breakfast, lunch, and dinner!
The very best Italian poutine in Montreal !  I kid you not, I have a picture of it hanging on my kitchen wall it is such a thing of beauty.The regular poutines, the pizzas and the subs are also delish. They make all their sauces from scratch.The portions are huge and the price is cheap.Love to watch the crowd that hangs at this place.Service is always fast and friendly. It's a pretty big place so there is almost never any wait to be seated. Except during the fireworks shows in June.Nothing fancy, just good honest eats.
I thought this place was "Restaurant Lafayette"- don't recall anything about a hotdog.  Oh well.$7 for OJ, Coffee, 2 eggs, 2 french toasts, 4 bacon, 2 toast, roasted potatoes, and a fruit salad? Um. Yes please.Great food, cheap prices, doesn't look like a secret, but well worth a detour to Papineau Metro for a cheap and filling meal.
This is the temple of cheap lunch! They have good casual food at very cheap price.
This is my go-to place for a nice inexpensive breakfast or a juicy burger.  The people are nice, service is fast and the food is good.
This is a real good place to go eat. I love the food over there. The price are a real bargain and their portions are huge! The place isn't too fancy, but they know the food is more important. Last I was there, the waitress was a real pain, she was slow and messed up my friend order, beside taking 30 minutes to bring us the bill... usually they're faster, so hopefully it was the exception.
What I like to do is buy a bag of pitas, some hummus, some quinoa salad, some pickled turnips, some labneh and some taboule, then just mix all that shit together in 5 sandwiches. Sometimes I get crazy and order the chicken and rice, and pop it in the mix. They also have amazing made to order sandwiches in the back if the former sounds like too much work.
I've been going there occasionally for about a couple of years. The food quality is good: very tasty. It used to be a very good deal, but lately (2016) they've become very stingy and cheap with the portion sizes. I was there the other day and they asked me if I wanted rice with the entree from the buffet. I said yes, and they then put about four tablespoons of rice on the plate. I hate it when a restaurant gets stingy and enacts the "portion control policy" with something as cheap as rice! It's all of five cents...
As I'm walking on st denis hungry :) I saw trip de bouf on the other side of the street it's said Boulangerie  libanaise. As soon as I came in in was taking by a beautiful smell that reminded of home, I knew this  was going to be an epic food experience and it was.They don't play around here :) it's legit.
I dropped by here today. I've been coming to Trip de Bouffer for the past two years and every single time the service was amazing and the food has been consistently unreal. I'm a bit picky with mMiddle Eastern food since I grew up eating it from the best chef ever: my mom :). But the food here is pretty close to perfect. Recommended: I absolutely love their veggie kebbe, mouhamara, the veggie pizza, chicken rolls (soo good!), and my all time favourite stuffed veggie vine leaves!As for prices, super cheap. The food is so filling. Everything is approximately a $1 and you get a deal if you get 1/2 a dozen etc. nothing expensive, well worth the great quality of food. 10/10!!!!!!!!- @Hanaer
Being middle eastern myself I have to say this is top notch Arabic food. It feels as if my own grandmother spent all day slaving in the kitchen whenever I eat here. The grape leaves are incredible, especially the vege ones and the kibbeh is scrumptious. I always get their spreads, the mhamara is my personal favourite. The staff, no matter who it is, is always so sweet and hard working. The decor is awesome with hints of Lebanese originals. I truly love this place, it is perfect and I will continue to come here again and again.@cchehade
It's like a mini "Adonis" supermarket with more finesse. Beautifully prepared lebanese appetizers and food. I don't see the link between the name of the place and Lebanon... It is confusing but hey surprise! It has baba ganoush and garlic sauce instead of imported ketchup or fancy old dry pasta. Great to have on the Plateau.
Sometimes you just feel like a hot home-cooked meal. But there is nothing in the fridge or you really can't be stuffed cooking. This would be the moment where you leg it down to Trip de Bouffe. They are serving up hot, ready-to-devour home-cooked meals, as well as salads, sweets, coffee, bread; anything you could ever want really. They also sell refrigerated dishes and salads so if you premeditate getting into the same snitch again you can always grab one of those on your way out to put in the freezer. I wish Trip was a bit closer to my apartment though, it's delicious and inexpensive which makes it a place I could easily wind up at every other day.
Fresh and tasty Libanese sandwiches, salads, warm dishes, baklava, etc. It's a great place to get a lunch to go (they have pre-packed items if you are in a rush, but it's not that long either for them to prepare you a sandwich).  I have always been able to find a place to sit down and eat there, even there are not that many tables. Staff is really nice. It's a spot that I visit on a regular basis, just about every week, and they always have a decent number of customers, which is a good sign, too!
L-O-V-E. I need an option with more than five stars, please!First of all, I was immediately struck by Richie's penetrating blue eyeballs. He has all the girls swooning, I am SURE.  Anyway, all lusting aside, this place was an awesome discovery. Located in the heart of the Plateau, TDB offers an awesome array of all things Lebanese, made fresh daily, with what appears to be a lot of love, by a dude called Pops (who is literally, Pops to one of the owners). They have a variety of pre-made items such as marinated turnip (squeal!), important goodies, nuts & spices, and of course, the main attraction: home cooked Lebanese food ranging from humus and chicken to falafel and Lebanese-style pizza (I forget what that's called). The food is delicious. Enough said. They do have a small section if you're in the mood to eat in, but I think it's more of a pick up and go kind of place. As well, if you're having a party and feel too lazy to cook - go see these guys and they'll hook you up. Noms.
Once you've eaten the pitas from this place, you'll never want to eat another grocery store pita again. You know they are made without loads of preservatives, because they go stale after only a few days, but with pitas this good its rare they will long enough to get to that point (stick 'em in the freezer if you can't eat them all in a day or two). And a trip to Trip de bouffe means the opportunity to stock up on dips and salads, and that's never a bad thing. I'm in love.
I am an expert at Lebanese food (not at modesty though) and I have to say that I really liked this place. Maybe the second best lebanese food that I ever had in Montreal. However, it is not a restaurant so I would recommend it for take-out. The staff is also very friendly.
Nom nom nom. Pita made in house - perfect. All salads sampled so far - tasty and beyond fresh. Stuffed vine leaves - in the top 5 ever tasted according to my partner.  All stuffed pastries sampled so far amazing! Ah nuts! I have made myself so hungry for these amazing goodies that I have to cut this review short to go out and get some more.So, briefly, pick up your goodies there for your picnic on the mountain or to nosh at home in the depth of winter to remind you of warm Mediterranean breezes.Also, the guys really know their stuff, ask them about their dishes - they're so knowledgeable and friendly it's an added treat. Off I go! (Did I bring enough bags to carry it all home?)
Sunday morning "breakfast" including spinach fatayer, kebbes and sambouseks at a newly open Lebanese bakery on the Plateau, Trip de Bouffe. Everything was fresh and tasty.Baklava: light and flaky, right amount of syrup on each layer, sign of freshness
This place is what i call a lil gem in the city. Its a lebanese Bakery full of home made  lebanese/Arab inspired goodies like Tabouleh , baba ganoush, Sambusac , baklava and an assortment of mixed salads, rice and meat dishes.  You can also find a variety of nuts , spices , juice, breads, yogourt, syrup drinks ( i hope you guys know of mint syrup or your life is missing something fundamental ) and the thing that i find most exciting : Olive oil - that you can actually sample before buying - offered in regular glass bottles or big metal bottles with a small faucet!  + so many more things to discover. An exciting little store for any food lover!This place is perfect  to come and pick up a lunch if you work around the mount royal area or pick up some of your favourite lebanese goodies ( i picked up some fresh whole wheat flat bread and humous )...and also just to discover some new flavours!
Definitely some of the best food served on Mont Royal. The staff is very nice too which is always a plus. Love their meat lasagna, the spaghetti pasta and the salmon pie.  They also have these delicious mozzarella and beef sticks for snacks. The prices are great too.
This has to be my favourite Lebanese place in Montreal! This is coming from someone who is originally Lebanese and very picky!Simply perfect! Food is so good and you can really taste how it's homemade!I can't wait to go back! Reminds me of home :)
Great little spot. Finally a little takeout Lebanese place in the Plateau. Everything I've had so far was great.
My friend bought an assortment of goodies for the superbowl and now I cannot stop thinking about the awesomeness.
Best Lebanese around, great prices.
Alright, I love oysters, I love open air markets and I love the chance to eat oysters at an open air market!This afternoon while at Marche Jean-Talon we happened upon this small raw bar loaded with a ton of oysters. After walking past this kiosk a few times, my tummy got the best of me and I tried a few of their oysters. Let me tell you, I was not dissapointed.The oysters were the best that I have had in a while and they had such a great variety of types that it was difficult to choose. The man shucking the oysters was really welcoming and made it a point to have a conversation with us. At the end of it all, the only dissapointing factor was that my bank account doesn't allot me the oportunity to eat all the oysters my stomach would allow!Moral of the story, if you like raw bars, don't miss this one!
We got a plate of oysters while waiting for the rest of the family to finish shopping. We got the Explorateur -12 oysters (4 different types) from Europe, East Coast, West Coast, and America.Super fresh oysters, shelled right in front of you. The selection is amazing. Theres also lemon, their own infused vinegar mixture, and all types of tobasco. My favorite were the Kelly Oysters from Ireland. So large and deep, and very creamy milky texture. I'd come here again and just get those!
During my last Weekend in Montreal, I was at La Boite Aux Huitres slurping oysters TWICE. I guess I must love them enough to make a repeat visit.But what's not to love. Fresh Fresh Oysters and with varieties!! Skillfully shucked and beautifully presented. First time we ordered 4 dozen. Then we back on Tuesday again for their $1 a shuck. $1 oysters another couple of dozen please. Located at Jean Talon Market, you just cannot miss that.
Walked in and immediately wanted oysters.Shucked right away and the guy working was very knowledgable about what he was serving and gives out good recommendations!
Honestly, I've tried oysters in restaurants before and I've never been a fan as I thought they were slimy, icky and had no taste.  I know they are supposed to pair well with wine but I am not a huge drinker.Anyways, once I saw this place at Jean-Talon and tasted a couple, I fell in love.  This place had at least 50 different types that were from the US, Canada or overseas.  I think I had a total of 9 oysters and each one had a distinct flavour.  Regardless, they were all delicious and the people were really nice.  Shucked on the spot for you.If you go to Jean-Talon in Montreal, this little oyster stop is a must.  I will be back here next time I'm in Montreal.
Oh man. If you like oysters, this is IT!All super fresh. Amazing variety. Really made my trip.  Too bad they don't allow wine these days but it just allows you to focus on the flavors of the Canadian east coast.
Great fresh ice cold oysters with a fantastic selection from West coast (not my thing) to East coast (my thing) and Europe too. Small counter... Worth the wait. They also have fresh uni if you're there early. Lots of toppings though they're so good it's a crime to mask their flavor so go light on whatever you top with. Procrastination held out until now as I was there on 5/25/14.
A fabulous place to try some fresh local oysters to eat in my case for breakfast before exploring this vast market.Highly recommended!
I'm back and this oyster stand is still so wonderful as the last time I visited. Actually this is the first time I'm in Jean Talon market and didn't even bother strolling around, being at La Boite aux Huitres turned to be completely satisfying experience.I'm not sure if the place has grown more popular or it was just a busy day, oyster hungry customers kept coming. At first we were a little bit deceived by the small chaos surrounding the stand (one can call it bar as you actually can sit around it), but once the bottle of white crispy wine was in front of us and oysters ordered everything was perfect. No need to go to SAQ anymore, there is a stand of local Quebec winery just next to La Boite, they will supply bottle of wine or cider with their tasting glasses making the experience classy. We had a dozen of oysters for 30 dollars, good deal for the quality and another six, including the gigantic ones from my picture that were buttery and you have no choice but eat them in two bites. People were having good time around and we did too .... number 99 never appeared to claim his oysters, regardless of the persistent calls of the personnel, I hope somebody else ate them.....So where would you like to be on a hot summer day in Montreal? For sure at La Boite aux Huitres slurping Canadian oysters and drinking Quebec wine!
This place is freaking amaaaaazing: oysters of all shapes, sizes and saltiness from east to west coasts. Your bounty is served up in a cute wooden box all shucked and pretty for you. The conversations and the people that you meet at the counter are always top notch and best of all? It's BYOB...nothing goes better with oysters than a nice white wine or a delicious bottle of champagne (the SAQ is literally 15 steps away, so you have absolutely NO excuse!) My only complaint is that the market hours aren't longer in the summer, so I cannot make this my dinner spot as the market closes at 18H on some week days: Boooo!***UPDATE: we wanted to have my birthday dinner here but the market closes at 6pm. The owner had some oysters put aside for me as a consolation...umm hello, best business ever! I am your most loyal fan La Boite aux Huitres! Bisous
We were happy to be part of La Boite aux Huîtres's first ever edition of the "Merci pour les Huîtres" event ("Thank you for the Oysters" event) in collaboration with Virginia Seafood. Three kinds of oysters were part of the event: J&W Seafood from Lower Bay Western Shore, Massawadox Salts from Upper Bay Eastern Shore and Sewansecott from Seaside.A little suggestion, the next time you will pass by the Jean-Talon market, come visit La Boite aux Huîtres and slurp some fresh delicious oysters! We promise you will fall in love all over again with the sea because we did!
Oysters of many varieties, shucked before your eyes, and presented in an adorable wooden box. They have both sweet or saltier ones, I like both so I had 2 sweet and 1 salty, while my companion had 3 salty ones. We agreed that all were delicious and perfectly fresh. On the side is some grated horseradish and lemon slices. You can also add tabasco sauce or malt vinegar. What else could you want? A nice snack, and great to enjoy with a bottle of cider purchased in the next stall.
This place would be an easy 4-star review, but because they let you bring a bottle of wine (from the SAQ just a few meters down the road), I had to make it 5. Let all other business owners on Yelp take note: Booze = Stars. The more you have, the betterThey have a great selection of oysters. From huge ones from the NE United States, to small (but tasty!) Japanese ones. You can easily get a selection by the dozen, and it's by far the best way to try out what's on offer.We had grabbed a bottle of white wine down the road, and we were able to sit at the bar and drink it with the oysters. When it comes to oysters, that's all I really need to have with them.It isn't cheap, but we're talking oysters here. For what they're serving, the prices are very reasonable.
Fantastic OYSTER BAR the entrance of Marché Jean-Talon. Prices are expensive, but the quality is VERY good. Do not expect happy hour prices. =P Ranges from $2-$3.50 / piece depending on the type of oyster you get. Dining "in" cost extra cuz they shuck it for you. To-go is a little cheaper, but unshucked. They have combos, or you can pick whatever you like. If you're unsure have them explain the oyster taste to you. We got a mix of salty and creamy oysters. Sorry can't even begin to remember where they were all from ... all over the world... many I have never heard of like "Phat Bastard' ... , but every single one tasted fresh and wasn't at all too salty. Wish we could've ordered every single one. =) Comes with a side of fresh horseradish and lemons on ice. Worth a stop in the market... great for sitting around, eating oysters, and watching the life of the market. :) Oh and if you like hot canadian guys shucking your oysters, this is a must stop ... *looks at someone in particular*
Stopped by while roaming the aisles of Marche Jean-Talon and couldn't resist trying some fresh shucked oysters from PEI (Prince Edward Island) and other local farms.Ordered a half dozen, shuckers choice, and they shuck them right in front, pack it on ice and mignionette and other condiments are in bottles on the counter. I'm giving 3-stars because they weren't as organized and somehow our order got lost between the cashier and the shucker so they skipped over us and then started bickering between themselves about why it's so disorganized.The oysters themselves were super fresh and cold and I wish I could have had a few dozen more.
Good service, very friendly staff. Oysters are delicious. I'd give a 5 star of they had more sauces or garnishing given other than lemon and tobasco sauce. But it's very yummy nonetheless!
A great way to start your morning at the Jean Talon Market.  They're just at the entrance as you walk you.  Sit down on a small counter, pick out your oysters, have them shuck it, and serve it on a small box.  Go early before it gets too busy.
Blackberry os my favorite oyster here!
Really delicious, great selection and fantastic service. Oysters are served shucked in a little wooden box full of ice. A delightful little stop at the Jean Talon Market. Super fresh oysters and affordable at an average cost of $2 - $2.50 per oyster.
Top notch oysters and friendly service. They turn a blind eye to brown bagged beers nd wines as well ;-) SHHhhhhhhhhhh...
While strolling through Jean Talon on a spectacular sunny day, we decided to stop and try this cute little oyster counter we saw the other day, located on the north-eastern s corner of the market.  It's a simple bar, with a couple of guys shucking oysters, we did not want to do full on so we just tried a quicky of 8 x 1$ special of the day oysters.  They are served on ice in a cute little box, all the fixins like hot sauce, malt vinegar, and of course lemon are available and it is very friendly.  In the short time we were there we saw many regulars show up and chat it up with the staff, you can tell they get lots of repeats and so they should.  The hubby asked if this was a byob, and sure enough they said yes! So if your in the hood, and want to try something different then your all set.  Eating oysters in the market, can beat it.  They have a good size selection and the prices seemed more than fair, I do believe they sell to go so it's a great way to sample before you buy.
We ordered a mocha latte and a cappuccino both were perfectly prepared. The cappuccino seemed a little bit more like an espresso I know it's not supposed to have much milk in it but this had a very small of milk in it. Yet it was so smooth and not acidic at all that it was very enjoyable. The mocha latte was perfect as well. Would definitely order both drinks again. They have a few tables inside with a different one right at the front window you do need to be careful so you don't fall off and get hurt. We couldn't get the Wi-Fi to work but it looks like other people were if we were staying longer were.  Would have asked for assistance but we weren't staying that long. Definitely recommend.
Location: Just off Ste. Catherine Est, in the Village. Street parking available [metered] and the closest subway stops are Berri and Beaudry [green]. The place: Very small with a communal table and bar-type seating right in front of the window. Obviously I chose the window because I like to look at people look at me when they walk by. It's a super casual atmosphere and there's no pretentiousness of any kind. Also, I didn't see any hipsters. I did stop in on a Tuesday afternoon so the place was quiet. I'm not sure how it looks on the weekend. The goods: I ordered a Macchiato with the home made almond + coconut milk. The milk is awesome and totally worth it. These guys use Pilot coffee, which I sometimes like, while at other times, it leaves me indifferent. I had a custom blend that was roasted specifically for a café in Québec City that was awesome. The blend used for this Macchiato was OK but it was a little bitter for my tastes. I still enjoyed it though, and I'd say these guys are in my top 6 coffee spots. Yes, that's right, SIX, not five!Service: The barista was so, so nice and friendly. Price point: $3.50 for the Macchiato, though I think there might be a surcharge for the home made milk. I forgot to ask. All in all, a very respectable coffee joint in this part of town. Check it!
Located a bit further east than I usually venture, I had to come here after reading the reviews... And the place did not disappoint!First of all, although I love plain ol' cow's milk, almond milk is my default for coffee, so I loved the house blend of coconut and almond milk. The coconut milk added an extra je ne sais quoi that worked perfectly with the nuttiness of the almond milk and the toasty notes of the espresso.They have a variety of baked goods on offer. I chose the banana-chocolate square, which was on the dry side, but it was pleasantly banana-y and had just the right amount of chocolate.The seating isn't the most plentiful and the arrangement isn't the most inviting, but it isn't terrible either. The window seats are perfect for people watching, but they're also up on a platform, so you do need to have some sense about you when going up and down - especially when you have one of their precious lattes in your hands!Will return for sure.
I went through the trouble of re-activating my YELP account just to post a review and give this café a well deserved 5 stars. Their "house milk" as other have mentioned really drives their product home. If you're in the area and you're looking for a excellent coffee based drink, or even a small snack (muffin, cookie, brownie) do not skip on the occasion to pay them a visit. The staff is friendly, not to discount others but Tony and Emma are extremely friendly and will make you feel like family! Another thing I found surprising is the amount of work that is put into making the right coffee; they weigh out the grounds and then weigh the coffee once its poured so you know it's consistently great. 10/10 will drink their coffee again!
Pourquoi Pas Espresso Bar serves hands down one of the best lattes I've had in Montreal so far! Located in the Village, it is easily accessible to downtown dwellers, workers, tourists and passersby. The only downside I find is that it closes so early (6PM everyday).Small and simple, the venue is decorated with cutesy works of art for sale. The barrista was very nice and produced a killer frozen latte. What more could I possibly ask for?
Pourquoi Pas is my favourite café east of Saint-Laurent and south of Mont-Royal, and among the very best in the city. All their beans are from Pilot in Toronto, the coffee organization behind the excellent Te Aro on Queen East and Crafted on Ossington. PP came through a recent change in ownership with completely consistent coffee. They have retained their (unusual for Montreal) rotating, two-option bean menu for espresso drinks, each posted with a few descriptors on a chalkboard. The staff are some of the sweetest and most welcoming folks you'll meet at a Montreal café, and they have a devoted local following in the Village. They've had a flat white featured prominently on the menu for years, and it is excellent, just like their lattes. Good wifi, and a rare, mostly (maybe all) vegan baked goods spread.
Definitely the best latte I've had in Montreal. The baristas have been very friendly each time I've visited and given suggestions on bean selection. The café itself is a little bare, but has some nice window-seating and is clean and inviting. Coffee is pretty much the only option, but it's good enough that that's ok.
The soy latte I got was good if a bit too foamy. The lemon-berry bar was delicious. The space is cramped but the window seats overlook the street. The location is just off the Main Street through the Gay Village. And yes they have soy milk!
great café in le village!while they use pilot coffee, it is their house blend almond milk that really makes the coffee shine and worth going back for more. well, if you're in the neighborhood.the place is really small with one community table and plenty of counter seats. there's no A/C in the place so it gets really hot.so don't forget to ask or say yes to their almond milk. that's the star of the café!
I had an excellent latte and scone here.When I ordered the scone, the gentleman behind the counter asked, "Do you want me to 'eat it up for you?"Not sure why he wanted to eat the scone I just purchased...
As good as Piccolo's Espresso Bar, and slightly cheaper. My go to coffee shop if I'm staying in hostels around St Catherine's, or indeed when I'm willing to walk for it.Choice of daily roasts (Ethiopian and Colombian when I was there). Serving staff were great, and price was right ($2.75). Had free wifi and you could sit at the window looking at the world, or at the bar chatting. A must go.
Coffee as coffee should be. Lots of respect to the process. The best coffee for those who care ;)
Pourquoi Pas Espresso Bar is a great place in the village for anyone anyone that wants a great cup of coffee (They serve other stuff but their speciality is coffee). I came of couple of times before. This time I ordrered a Flat White, a hot cocoa and one of their homemade yogurt. The decor is standard for a coffee shop. Which means that you can either sit at a table, at the bar or closer to the big bay window giving a great view of Ahmerst. The service was laid back and professional. All of my questions were answered quickly and I was even asked some more. I was offered to either have my Flat White with home made almond milk, soy milk or with cow milk. All of the options were nice little options that made my experience even better.The coffee was obviously the star of the afternoon! I had a Flat White which was totally different from the one you can get at Starbucks. First it wasn't drowned in hot milk. Second, it tasted like actual coffee. Third it was totally delicous. My cocoa was also very good. It wasn't overly sweet and the cocoa tasted a bit like cinnamon. The yogourt was served with dried fruits. It was as delicious as it was healthy.Will I come back? For sure I will!
A great little spot with an impressive selection of coffee to choose from...perfect for 1 on 1 meetings. A noteworthy mention to the "screw head" Pourquoi Pas Espresso Bar signage in the storefront window.
Wow!!! Great coffee and company !!! The attention to detail, the smile of the barista , makes you want to come back ! See you soon!
Wonderful staff and delicious coffee in the heart of the Village. Worth a return visit for sure!
Mocha was luke warm and super expensive, nearly $5. The lady who owned the shop was really nice though, salvaged a poorer coffee rating.
Face meltingly good coffee and espresso. I am not exaggerating at all when I say that this is the best coffee I have ever had. They have multiple grinds available every day and the barista can tell you the details of each without batting an eye or pausing to think. Words can't really express how good the drinks are here, but I'm about to try.Espresso drinks are complex beasts. The espresso shot needs to be good, which means your grind must be good, which means your roast must be good, which means you actually have to care about your product and put a ton of effort into it. If you can pull a good shot, you still have to get the milk right. I know that seems like it should be the easy part, but it's a detail that you can't overlook. Most places, even dedicated independent coffee shops (not just Starbucks/Dunkin/Tim Hortons), get their milk too hot; when you overheat your milk it gets bitter and acidic and no longer serves as a foil to the bitterness/acidity of the espresso, but instead it amplifies all the bad flavors you don't want.  When I placed the mug between my hands and they were warmed but not scalded I knew I was in for a treat. My expectations were exceeded in ways I couldn't have imagined in my wildest caffeine fueled dreams. After I scraped my face off the table I finished my mocha (not too sweet, not too milky, jusssssst right).  On top of crafting amazing drinks, Tony the barista is super friendly. I felt welcomed the second I walked into the bar. On my first day in Montreal he gave me a sample of their freshly delivered baked goods (the onion tart was AWESOME). Then he recommended I try a few things and when I came back the next day he not only remembered my name but asked how my day had gone and had a few more suggestions. Nicest guy I met on my whole trip. The interior space is limited but I'd say it's more "intimate and cozy" than "cramped." They don't have wi-fi but there are a few plug sockets if you're desperate. After you finish your drink, try their water. There won't be a bitter taste in your mouth that you need to rinse out and your mouth won't be burned but you'll be doing yourself a disservice if you don't try their super delicious water before you leave. No, I'm not joking. The water pitcher is filled with lemon peel and fresh thyme sprigs which is the dopest water combination ever.When I return to Montreal, this is my first stop.
For someone who drinks as much coffee as I do in as many cafés as possible, it's rare for a café to truly surprise me. Pourquoi Pas did, and in a very good way.It started with ordering a latte. I was met with a simple question: what kind of milk? The options that followed were not the "skim, 2%, whole" that I'd expected, though, but rather, "house-made almond/coconut, soy, or cow's milk". Hearing "lait de vache" come across, with a slight prickliness to it, caught me off guard. (Of course I know milk comes from cows, but never when ordering a drink does that fact come to my attention.) I stumbled. I fumbled. "Regular, you know, um, milk." Herp de derp, smooth move, Katie. After tripping over my obviously non-vegan beverage order (callous carnivore as I am), I looked at the menu more closely and noticed that cow's milk carries an extra surcharge, and is indicated by a weepy broken heart on the chalkboard. I was tickled by their apparent display of ethics (and judgment?), and determined to try their lait maison the next time, so I could be a cool and compassionate coffee snob, too. I also noticed that their standard coffee was an Aeropress, which gets props from me (I love my home Aeropress), and also noticed the striking lack of other options on the menu. This is, uncontestedly, an espresso bar. A one-trick pony, perhaps, but that one trick is a showstopper.The latte set before me -- made with creamy dairy goodness stolen from the mouths of bleating calves at their mothers' teats -- was phenomenal. Perfectly balanced, not bitter in the least, and made with a perfect microfoam swirled into lovely latte art. Mmmmm. The next time at Pourquoi Pas, not even a week later, I tried their house almond and coconut milk, and was impressed. It made great foam, and had a rich but sweet nutty flavor. But, for all that, even with the added bonus of self-righteousness for not exploiting our bovine friends, I regretted not getting cowmilk. Sweet, delicious, calorific, uncompassionate cow's milk. I'll placate my conscious by imagining that the extra charge goes toward buying the most wonderful, single-origin, free-range, fair-trade, grass-fed, eco-conscious milk from the happiest cows in Quebec. Or one can hope.
Aeropress of the day is excellent coffee.  This is really high quality stuff.  If you require cream and sugar, skip Pourquoi Pas; the subtleties of good coffee will be lost.  Nice little shop, friendly staff, decent prices. A few people have said the best coffee ever, and while I don't agree, it is quite good.
Amazing  Espresso... Their name implies exactly what they are good at.  The atmosphere is  very relaxing too.
Coming up on their 1 year anniversary, Tony & his small crew are cranking out top notch espesso drinks matching the best in the city (Myriade, Névé/Flocon, Café Plume, Pikolo).Good bean, grind, machines, and baristas.  All you need for fantastic espresso.Beans are from Te Aro (Toronto based kiwi Andy Wilkins), meaning Pourquoi Pas is skilled enough to earn the right to buy their roast.- Te Aro has one 24kg roasting machine = capacity to support ~ 30 cafés- Canadian roasted coffee is duty free to USSo, one can infer that Pourquoi Pas is judged by Te Aro as one of the top 30 cafes in the ON, QC, and possibly IL, NY, MA area (the reasonable shipping cost area)Wow... too much caffeine = crazy tangents.If you're gonna get wired, why not do it with the best?p.s. their wifi is up and running
Trying out thus place first time.  Ordered two latte one of each of their daily espresso roast.   Both I love.  Friendly staffs here made a perfect latte with their house milk (mixed of coconut milk and almond )  very pretty latte art.  Which made the latte looks and feels extra special.  ^_^  Will definitely come back to this little place of heaven when I am back.
No wiifi and he was mean about it.  Americano tastes bad and the chairs are very uncormfrtable.
Come for your caffeine fix, but that's all she wrote.Any place which serves you different beans based on you having either a black it white (milk) coffee is doing a good thing.The place itself is nice and obviously new, but I wasn't such a fan of the seating arrangements - it's very much a coffee bar, not a cafe, so don't come planning to spend a long time here.I was going to give this place 3 stars because they also have no food available (none at all!), but in the end I decided the coffee was good enough to warrant 4 stars. I ordered a flat white and it came out more like a piccolo latte, but maybe that's just an Australian opinion.This is the kind of place I wish I lived next to, so I could hit it up on the way work everyday.
There can never be enough caffeine in me these days and I am very grateful that Pourqois Pas is close to work. Yes, it's not the fastest place to grab an espresso, but all good things take time. Usually two types of beans to choose from, you can have the house blend of coconut and almond milk for any coffee bevies normally requiring dairy.These guys know their stuff and are super friendly!
Delicious ! Delightfull! A gentle whisper of study and read. The coffees are real and tasty.
Fantastic coffee oasis.  Highly trained, passionate, and pleasant baristas.  Great coffee options.  All around well done
I loved this place! I wanted a good coffee spot near our hotel in Montreal and I found this cute little spot thru Yelp. The set-up is really laid-back and the barista was very nice and friendly. He even gave us recommendations for our stay. And the cappuccino was great so we came back again while on our short trip.
Pourquoi Pas is hands down my favourite espresso bar in all of Montreal. They do everything right - from the source of their coffee beans to the way they make their coffee; the simple atmosphere of the store; and the welcoming personalities of every one of their owners and staff. To be honest, I would give them more than 5 stars if I could. It's no accident that their coffee is so well-made: the owners Tony and Tyler have a real passion for creating great coffee, and the quality of every cup of coffee matters to them in a personal level. They charge a pretty standard price for coffee. Each cup of coffee is topped off a nice little latte art as well (as shown in the photos).
What I like about Pourquoi Pas:- Serious espresso drinks- Delicious almond+coco milk- Friendly owners and baristas- Free wi-fi- Te Aro (Pilot) fresh beans on sale. Must try the ViIla Donia! ;)Enjoy!^_______^
the best coffeein the worldor at least the parts i've been to.
I had a delightful latte here, and one thing that I noticed that was actually pretty awesome, was not having to pay extra for either soy or their house blend of coconut almond milk. Cow milk on the other hand was extra. When I got here, they had an array of sandwiches in the fridge (as well as salads) and offerings of vegan donuts. I didn't have a chance to try them but will give them a go next time Im in.
Im a decent barista, but these guys are amazing.  Totally progressive in their approach. Ill admit I was apprehensive at first.  Most impressive was the complexity of their single origin.  No need for a blend...I tried the el salvador (cap)and burundi (macchiatto) the default coconut or almond milk is a plus, but most baristas cant pull that off and make it taste right.  It tasted right. These guys are official.
Only OK in comparison to many other third-wave coffee joints in Montreal. A little slow (they only seem to take one order at a time), decent coffee shot (choice of roast is a nice touch) but the milk was upsetting. Well, as upsetting as milk can be. Almond-coconut milk is a nice concept on paper but kind of turned out as Franken-milk in practice as it made the cappuccino taste much too coconut flavoured (hello Starbucks!), and it wasn't even particularly well-steamed. Of course, you can choose regular milk but annoyingly it's not the default so you have to pay extra. That said, it's the only third-wave in the Village area, so, props for trying?
What a wonderful little coffee shop! It's small, cozy, welcoming and, above all, the coffee is delicious. And if you're a fan of almond milk, ask for their homemade cocoa almond milk. It's amazing!
They don't come any coffee-snobbier than me, and I dug this place.  Took the barista's recommendation and had the latte with the house almond/coconut milk.  Magnefique.
Another great addition to the growing third wave family in Montreal. Friendly knowledgeable staff serving up te aro on a little 2 group marzocco. Tasty shots, great milk and attention to detail. As others have said, more of a bar than a full cafe, so leave the laptop at home. Take a look on the chalk board where you'll find the day's selection of beans and don't hesitate to chat up your barista.
The coffee is excellent. The staff are friendly, helpful and eager to discuss their coffee and give brewing advice. They carry and brew Te Aro coffee from Toronto.  One can typically choose between three kinds of coffees for cups consumed on the premises but they sell a larger selection of beans as well. Another point of interest is they serve flat whites.  The focus is on the coffee, there is limited seating and wifi is not available.
The short version: best coffee in MTL.The long: I recently moved here from San Francisco and I've been hunting for a place with coffee as good as philz or ritual or blue bottle. I've tried olimpico and cafe neve both of which are fine but pourquoi pas is the first place that really reminds me of home: great coffee, great staff, no attitude. Its got to be in the running for best coffee in the city.  I'll be back often.
let's just start by saying that just because i'm italian doesn't make me a coffee expert... BUT it helps!! i've drank so many espressos in my life at so many places that my palate is a bit critical!!please never drink espresso where they write eXpresso (clue #1  !!!)i stumbled on Pourquoi Pas while parking right in front of it, so after my lunch i decided to make a stop and try their coffee. i was pleasantly surprised just by the place itself, very small nothing fancy, great smell, a good ol' coffee shopdon't know the names of the 2 guys,  but they are just great and serviceable.being served a shot of mineral water to rince your palate is a great way to impress me (not all good places in Italy even do this anymore!!)the SHORT espresso was fantastic: nice nose of hazelnut? kinda biscotti type, nice ring of «schiuma» (little foam on top) and the taste was to my liking: a bit of acidity (wich some people might not like) and well balanced on the intensity.can't talk about the other coffees they offer 'cause i'm an espresso man, but i can't imagine how they would go wrong, since they seem so professional with their approach.the prices of coffees are really reasonable not overpriced at allthe only reason i did not give them 5 stars is because of their food prices, maybe it's just me and all the other places do it, but 1,50$ for a small cookie (as good has it might be) is way too much for me.to all TH and Starbuck lovers, continue to drink ur diluated bad water/coffee!!i know it's not possible, but we start by rincing our palate with mineral water, we could finish by rincing our cup with...  GRAPPA!!! Salute
I enjoyed my coffee Americano, my sister was disappointed in hers.... she's not familiar with African blends ,consecquently, did not like the very light looking coffee or the taste. Very pleasant,attentive staff, very airy, sun-filled  space but limited seating.One can sit here and relax  and just enjoy one's coffee while watching the world go by on a quiet afternoon.
What a treat to find this fantastic espresso bar. I am visiting from SF and second everything said previously. The staff was friendly and gave me several food recommendations for my trip. The espresso was as good as my favorite haunts back home. The shots were pulled with care. This place is a must stop for any coffee lover's trip to Montreal.
I read the other reviews and went. Fantastic. All they do is coffee and, I guess tea, so don't go for any other reason. But they are very serious about their coffee, very nice, and totally unpretentious. I tried two different espressos today- a Brazilian and a Tanzanian, and both were expertly made. Will go back tomorrow for further adventures. They also gave me (a first time visitor to Montreal with no French) a whole list of food recommendations around town. I went to the Marche St. Jacques as suggested and it is spot on for my taste as well. If these reviews speak to you, then this is your coffee place...
The coffee is wonderful, and Tony really gets people together.  His cold brew is my local favorite
Love the laid back atmosphere here...if you didn't find this place online you'd probably never know it existed as it's kind off the beaten path. That being said, it's totally worth the trip.They have the best manakesh pizzas that are made in a wood burning oven, the smell just lingers around this 2 floor joint. Not only can you enjoy some amazing and authentic middle eastern food as well as drool worthy desserts, you can also just hang out with friends and smoke shisha for a few hours. The best part is that the prices are so low. I mean, the pizzas are like 3$The staff  and owner are really inviting and kind as well, a definite place to check out if youre around concordia!
During the entire winter, whenever we went for a walk downtown, we had to finish the evening with hot fresh mint tea! And of course, being foodies, we order a wrap and desserts alongside our tea as a real midnight treat! Their wraps are baked in a stone oven, the outside being crispy whilst the inside just melts in your mouth! When you're done with it, you literally crave for your next visit to have that experience again!Their desserts are of a high quality, homemade traditional arabic delights such as kunefe and baklava, prepared with love and passion. Before serving, they drizzle a homemade honey syrup over the dessert which is amazing!! The interior is basic - cosy and warm but they need to step up their heating system. It is a great place for takeaways especially desserts which they are popular for. The staff are always welcoming and at your service.
Great service!!!! And the manakeesh is super cheap! It is $5 for the egg and cheese, and it is thin and crispy. It's baked in the wonderful brick oven.Now they make LOTS of desserts too but they are not insanely sweet. I've had these kinds of desserts before but very artificially sweet, it's weird. I never liked these kinds of desserts. But here at Al-Baghdadi, they are quite delicious!! I love the sesame one the most.
Delicious manaeesh, pizza pies, calzones and fatayer, I tried lots of things and everything was super tasty. The dough is cooked fresh in a brick oven and it's perfect....I ordered the lahmajoun (meat pie), Zaatar manaeesh, the chicken manaeesh and the cheese ones, I also had the mergez cheese calzone and it everything was amazing. As side dishes I had hummus, labneh, the spicy potatoes and everything was fresh and delicious. The staff are friendly and service is fast. Highly recommended.
I was in Montréal with my husband and we were trying to celebrate our anniversary.Sunday night and almost all places were closed, just a few were open, but the prices (especially in Villa-Marie) made us feel as though we were being robbed.So we quick searched on Yelp "turkish open" and we found this place. Thankfully we found this place.The food is delicious and the price is unbelivable. I felt that I was stealing from the place because we paid so little for the amazing quality and taste.The owner is a very attentive person and treats you kindly.We had:Manakeesh (ground beef): it has a complex flavor, hints of cinnamon made it an amazing flavor with great smell.Fatayer (cheese): simply amazing. Seriously, try it.Pita with hummus: smooth, good creamy consistency and flavor is nice. The taste is simply a very great hummus, with no other mixed tastes.Their pastries: we tried all of them and, no exception, all were exceptional.This place should have a 5+ on reviews. It definitely saved our night celebration.Plus: they have brick oven that's wood burning.This is a real must try in Montréal.
We came on Saturday, and now here we are back on Sunday.Delicious manakish, one of a kind.The best I've tasted in town.I got a hummus manakish with a cheese wrap. My husband got the kefta manakish and chicken wrap. The bread is so good and fresh, the taste is just amazing. To finish off this amazing meal, we got a sort of creamy dessert. Sugary but not so much that it would hurt my stomach. Meals are so cheap too so if you're on a budget and you need a tasty filling dinner, you're at the right place.
Been meaning to get around to re-review this place. I have been coming here a lot more since the first time I had walked in here months ago.Ill begin with the staff. They are all very friendly and really make you feel welcomed.The food is still as amazing as it has always been. The fresh baked breads in their oven really make a difference. I highly recommend their calzones.The hookah area upstairs is great. Nice and cozy. I especially like that they provide us with natural coals as opposed to quick light coals. A must for any true lover of shisha.I have tried many shisha places around Montreal and this one is always my go to. If only you could order a beer ;)
This place is a hidden patisserie/ shisha bar that's tough to find.I didnt try the food, but it looked delicious. As for the shisha we got grape/lemon/mint and it was really really good. I would come back here for the shisha but my only complaint would be that they dont really have many options. Other places usually have tons of options and are able to mix flavours, but in this place they dont really know how to. But still, its a nice place to chill with friends, smoke shisha and enjoy the conversation.As for the service, it was amazing. The waiter was very friendly, made tons of jokes and made us laugh even till the second we left.
My husband and I went here for lunch recently when we were in Montreal.  I thought it was ok, but my husband really liked it.We ordered 3 Armenian Pizzas: the Chicken ($3.95), the Lahmbajeen ($2.75), and the Sujouk ($3.50).  The pizzas are 9" each, so they are a good size.  The crust is super thin, so one person can definitely eat 1 pizza.  I was able to eat 1 1/2 pizzas no problem.They make the pizzas to order, so you do have to wait a bit for them, but it's worth it because they are fresh.  The pizzas are more like Middle-Eastern meat pies (Lahmajouns) and not Italian pizzas.  The Chicken Pizza was probably my favourite.  It was topped with finely diced chicken and spices.  The Lahmbajeen Pizza was like a traditional Middle-Eastern meat pie, it was topped with a thin layer of ground beef with tomatoes and spices.  I found this pizza a little bland.  The Sujouk was similar to the Lahmbajeen except it was spicy (hot) and for some odd reason very oily.  I found the topping was too oily and I didn't like it for that reason.  My husband really liked the Sujouk Pizza.The staff there are very nice.  The place is deceptively big inside.  If you are looking for some fresh Manakish, you can come here.
A hidden gem on Lincoln st. Loved the food, cleanliness, and the spacious seating area
Delicious makaneesh thing.  Ask for spinach and cheese, it's amazing!! Also I ordered a small cheese pizza, its adorable and good for one person.  The desserts..didn't try But they must be good! :)
What the hell with this place?  I mean could it be true?  I sure as hell am not in the middle of a the dessert experiencing a mirage!  This is frankly a place with a whole bunch dudes running around making GREAT pastries and my favorite Middle-Eastern desserts.  I swooned!  Granted, they didn't have Katayef but I will get over it because I ordered the Osmalieh bel Ashta and it was astronomically delicious; I didn't even pour the sugar syrup on.  There was no need to.  Also ordered the Soujok wrap which was good but didn't knock my socks off like the dessert but then again, anything with ashta steals my heart.  I want to lay in it!  Don't miss out on this place.  Not the warmest but by far one of the best dessert spots.
Cheap, quick, tasty! I didn't expect to have such a fresh pizza dough by paying just like 3-4$ for each plate. I liked the atmosphere too, with not perfect but warm-hearted service. They don't do their job for getting tips. We get more than what we pay and I definitely come back there.
A fourth experience and still as excellentThe service perfectPolite and very friendly staffDo not forget to order The mix sheesha :)
Not sure if we went there in their not favorite day or not.... They have a menu with hugeee selection of desserts.. We were so excited to order.. But the guy told us there is only one type of desert are available! So we ordered it was so old and taste bad.. We had a tea too.. Supposed to be Iraqi style but it was burned too much!...  The location is not suitable for people with wheelchair/stroller/disabled... No I don't recommend this place to anyone.. I was so embarrassed with my friends there ;(
We came here after reading all the great reviews and I'm really suprised it got more then one star. And honestly, I would actually give 0 stars!First of all this place is nasty! The tables where dirty.... Everything was really worn out looking and filthy.We ordered Zaatar and Halloumi manakeesh. They are ok. The Halloumi had maybe 3 very tiny slices of Halloumi, that didn't taste like anything. The zaatar was mostly dough with a little Zaatar sprinkled on top. So if you like Lebanese/ Middle Eastern food DON'T come here!
I write all my reviews based on a student budget:Got the nutella and chicken pizzas for about $8 total for two people, absolutely delicious! I would say it's a light dinner if you have 1 or 1.5 of them (which I did). Told the manager I combined a nutella and chicken slice and it was scrumptious, he didn't respond too kindly (but multiple friends have done the same so maybe the world just isn't ready), other than that he and the staff were very hospitable and welcoming. I'll be going back soon.
Great place! Very inexpensive, and the food is consistent! The spicy meat calzone is a bit greasy, but by far one of the better pizzas in Montreal! Their dessert selection is extensive, and delicious. Pretty good bread overall, fast delivery.
To be honest when I first came here with a friend I was not very tempted to try any of their desserts. They looked so strange and foreign. Tried some sort of dessert in a huge pan and it was soo good. They microwaved it and i still have no idea what it was but it tasted like melted cheese and sugary rose syrup.
really good food for the price. Nice atmosphere, nice people!Would definitely go back.
A nice and friendly place to have a quick bite. All the food was delicious and reasonably priced. More of a relaxing atmosphere, and the service is not necessarily attentive so if you need anything just ask.
Only 4 flavored at 10pm on a Saturday.  No coal exchange after an hour of smoking and ordered water bottles...about an hr ago...not sure how hard it is to bring water bottles.  AND it's not that busy.  Need more help or better customer service
The wrap I got was superb--the bread/wrap was baked on-order, and the half-spinach half-cheese base cooked into the bread thereafter.  Stuffed with olives and tomato (you get to choose), tasted great, and cost close to $5.I got 6 baklava to go (one of each flavor available) for $5--really all good, and so many other sweets to try--I would if I could!Only downside was that the service was uneven.  The restaurant was quiet for early lunch; I got my wrap ordered and cooked immediately.  Nobody was servicing pastries, and I had to wait a while for that.  I wasn't in a rush, so it was OK, but ... not very organized service.As an added bonus, however, because of the slow service, the waiter insisted that I receive my baklava "on the house".  The food was too good for me to accept, so I wound up tipping extra to make up for the difference.
Best falafel we've had. Great texture. Highly recommend.
This place kicks butt.  Sea of pastries and sweets.  Will definitely go back to this place.
Cheap, freshly baked yumminess a hop away from Concordia! The "pizzas" are very well priced...basically you can make your own toppings. I had a pizza with spiced ground meat, cheese, onions, some veggies...We also tried a chicken topped one which was very tasty. My only issue was that the spicy meat was not spicy at all and pretty "meh". The winner here is the crust that they bake on demand when you order. There is a small wait due to this, but nothing atrocious. Employees were very nice. We were the only girls in there haha. Seems to be frequented by younger Arab men. The sweets we tried (baklava and some other pistachio ones) were not the best. Shisha is available as well upstairs. Cheap eats!
This place has awesome desserts and awesome "pizzas". We loved the food and have been back couple of times. A great place for a snack or a meal. I absolutely recommend it. P.s. Their special tea is pretty yummy too. I generally ask for a bit of honey on the side to sweeten it.
Very nice place! I read about this place on yelp and found some good reviews about it. So I though I would try it. The place is really nice. They have freshly baked pizzas with bread baked right there in their oven. They have a section for pastries! Really delicious and fresh ones. They have a place to sit (on the upper level) specially for smoking shisha, but fortunately it is not too crowded nor it is full of smoke. I do not smoke shisha but like the smell as long as the environment is not full of smoke. I really enjoyed this place. You should give it a try.I ordered a turkish coffee here. Really liked the taste. It was different and after asking the owner he said it is a blend of different coffees plus a touch of cardamom. I really loved it.
Takes all night to get service, still waiting for the water I ordered 30 minutes ago. Friends say hookah is alright. Total bro run biz
Delicious 'usmaliya'...dessert made with vermicelli noodles and a sweet yummy cream on the inside which is just the right amount of sweet :) their mango smoothie was fresh and delicious too! It was a little on the quiet side when we visited but the freezing cold weather outside meant that not many people would want to go out anyway, I can imagine this place being an amazing get together place in the Summer! Would definitely come here in the Summer and looking forward to trying their Baghdadi drink which seems to be a heavenly combination of all things good and calorific :)
Place is nice Owner is a good guy Amazing Lahm b'ajeen Great pastry I'd come again if I ever went back to Montreal
This is an up and coming Middle Eastern bakery that hasn't lost its touch just yet, hopefully it never will! Every single restaurant that has attempted to run in that particular location has always shut down, but so far... this one has stuck around the longest and seems to be gaining popularity. It has definitely won me over.The interior is quite large, spacious, and looks great - making it worth it to sit and eat there too. Al-Baghdadi has a beautiful brick oven and you get to see them do everything from scratch, from the making of the dough until it is ready to be served! They have a variety of options, add-ons, and desserts to satisfy your palate, and the staff are welcoming, funny, and will always recognize you.Perhaps a part of me expects more because I, myself, am Arab, but I think I just appreciate and expect tradition and quality more than anything. It's hard to find an Arabic restaurant that gets everything down right, and I have never been disappointed in all my visits here. I definitely recommend it over Al-Taib, hands down.
We waited almost an hour for some appetizers and tea. The food was cold when we got it too. The shisha was great. I don't think I will come back because of the wait and the cold food. The waiters were really nice and apologized for the wait though. We paid almost $60 for a few appetizers and shisha, a little pricey I thought.
I've only had the cookies from here so I can't comment on the savoury foods. If you need to bring small cookies for a gathering (workplace or fun) this is the perfect place to get lovely bite-sized cookies at a very reasonable price. I'm not sure of the price calculation, but the only comparable cookies in presentation sold nearby is nocochi near the museum on Sherbrooke, or the bakery at Adonis on ste cath, but this place is easily less than half the cost of nocochi, and looks nicer than a box of cookies from the grocery store.
I've been there for several times. Every time, the service was fantastic, they are truly polite and friendly and they help you to choose the thing that you really want. Even when you don't have any idea about the food, they describe it in an understandable way. Shisha is a good part and don't miss the sweets which you never forget their tastes.
I have written a review on a seperate page for this place where you can see all the photos.This is one of the best places in downtown montreal for a delicious affordable fresh meal.They also have shisha in a seperate room upstairs.You are an idiot if you go to Al-Taib for a flatbread instead.  You have no excuse unless you have 4 minutes to get food into a bag.
After attempting to eat at Qing Hua just down the road and rudley told no close to closing time we stopped here and wow what a great find. I am not sure if we ever did this but we started with dessert. It blew our minds away how good it was!! WTF they put in there. I never had anything close to this but on the island of crete. then the food came which was all excellent. We tried as much as we can or the body can. I will be back and Qing Hua lost us as a customer...,.avoid very rude but good food.
Sweetness: This places rates on all 3 measures of Atmosphere, Service, & Food :O)Atmosphere:  Al-Baghdadi Pastry (ou Patisserie Al-Patisserie en Français) is located on Lincoln Avenue, a relatively quiet street just off Guy Street (near the Sherbrook intersection).  Since place is run by an Iraqi family (hence the name) - and it run very much as a family business.  The place itself if well lit, clean, and spaciously designed with a stone hearth welcoming patrons as they enter, and an elevated inner section where the full menu of freshly baked Arabic desserts is on display.  The place is not exactly designed for sit-down dinning, given that the menu itself is constructed of items often take-out to eat rather than enjoyed at a dining table (more on that below)Service: If Al-Baghdadi fails in anything - slightly - it's the service.  Not because it's bad mind you! Given that it's a family business, the staff seems a little undermanned and as such the serivce may be a little slow or rushed at times.  If you know how to speak Arabic (even a little) you'll find that the staff if very friendly and talkative - being very proud of what they do.  Good people.Food: Ah - you'll love to eat here.  This isn't a "slam, bam, thank you mam - type of place" (a good example of that is "Al-Taib" on Guy just a few steps away).  The wait may be longer but the food is always made in front of you, and is served piping hot.  From Zahtar (thyme) to cheese Manoushe, to spinach and meat triangles (Sambousek) etc.  Typical Arabic bakery food at its best (a little more pricey than the competition but worth it).  Al-Baghdadi, REALLY excels however is giving you the best (and I stand by that) Arabic sweets in down-town Montreal (if not all of the city).  They may they best "knafeh" (baked cheese sweet with warm sugar syrup), as well as other Cheese and Cream (Kashta) Filled Sweets in addition to Gourmet Baklava (many types) and Mamoul.You'll love the authenticity! Go!
I really love the food here. Cheap, fresh, and delicious. Order a Zataar and cheese all dressed, or the egg and cheese. Desserts are also super amazing. This place is the real deal, and the food is awesome. I even like their fruit cocktail drink, which is like a guava and assorted fruits smoothie. Amazing!
This review is based solely on their desserts. The first day I went there, with the intention of getting kanafe. I knew they would probably run out quickly, so I decided to give them a call. Their phone is constantly busy or they just don't want to provide proper service to their customers. It is probably the later. When I arrived to the restaurant, they did not have any kanafe, so I opted for the baklava. Their phyllo pastry tasted old. Their sugar syrup was lacking. The whole baklava was rather soggy. Definitely not the worst, but not best. Would not go for just baklava. The next day, I came for kanafe. I would give it an 8 out of 10. They serviced it cold, but maybe that was my fault, because I told them I wanted it as takeout. As for the customer service, it was horrible. I had to stand around waiting for someone to give me eye contact. I stood at the counter for 5 minutes. All in all, go for the kanafe, but be prepared for the bad customer service.
There is plenty of seating..and we were starving but the food took over an hour to come. Even though it was the middle of the day and the restaurant was otherwise empty.  However the food was delicious and fresh and hot. But not sure if I can sit through a wait like that again..brutal
Loved it. Huge brick oven, super-fresh bread and yummy pastries. And cheap for the high quality -- probably the best value for food during our time in MTL. Not sure how or when it gets used but there are two more floors of seating upstairs.
Al Baghdadi has perfected the mana'eesh like no other in Montreal.. It's done perfectly in brick fire .. Love this place for weekend brunches and late night hunger strikes .. Satisfying every time.. And luckily .. I live half a block from it..
Super  Arabic- style chicken pizza, as well as others, served fresh out of the wood burning oven. Piping hot,lovely crisp crust,tender chunks of roasted chicken,and not at all salty. I had a side platter of tabouli which paired beautifully with the pizza. I decided to hell with the calories and to just live a little, and ordered a good slice of cream-filled pastry,freshly made, for dessert, with a cup of tea to wash it down,and it was excellent. The restauarant is divided into 2 sections, the front preoccupies itself with  lunch/dinner items, and has only 4 tables, the large back section, is Mid-Eastern  pastries galore, but you  can order and sit where you like. There is also an upstairs, with waiter/ress service. Glad I came here instead of that "other" place,wish I'd only made the trip here sooner, will definitely be back!
excellent kunafa, baklava and other treats. Special Turkish coffee. And service with a smile. Can't wait to come back again!
Un petit restaurant - traiteur qui vaut le détour ! Avec son entrée au 1er étage, sans Yelp nous ne l'aurions sans doute pas remarqué. Accueillis gentiment dès l'entrée, nous nous sommes laissés conseillés. La pizza arménienne (Manakish) au Sujouk (boeuf épicé), et celle au poulet étaient délicieuses et légères. Nous avons aussi dégusté de l'houmous avec une petite salade et du pain. Puis nous avons fait le plein de patisseries orientales aux pistaches et noix de cajou. Un restaurant qui allie simplicité, qualité, gentillesse à un prix incroyablement abordable. Bravo !
Nice little coffee shop great latte a nice break before heading for a Movie just in front
Such a charming coffee shop! I had some tea, and it was delicious. The staff is beyond friendly, good music playing and calm atmosphere. I will sure be back for some coffee.
Best cappuccino in Montreal so farExcellent not overroasted coffee. Well done foam. Served with a glass of water. and nice place, quite corner off busy street with outdoor seating.
I tried latte. I felt it just latte, nothing special. But I really like the quiet environment. The almond croissant is good. I liked it, although Mr. Tang felt it a little sweet to him.
I wind up here at least once every visit to Montreal, especially if I take the Greyhound bus which stops right nearby. Solid coffee spot near St. Denis, and comfy little space to sit and work a bit. Loved the Kendrick Lamar soundtrack for my last visit.
Coffee was out of this world and high quality.  This is off the beaten path and looks more like a place for locals than tourists, I would absolutely go back again.
Delish. Great coffee and great tea (coming from next door - Camelia Sinensis). Absolutely delicious baked goods. I don't know where they're from, but I want to eat them all.Warm, cozy and bright. Friendly staff, decent seating, close to many things. Certainly worth the trip off of Saint Denis's crowded sidewalks.
Latte parfait. J'ai aussi pris le muffin pommes caramel avec ... Un régal ! J'ai failli céder pour le muffin citron-graines de pavot mais j'ai été raisonnable : ce sera pour la prochaine fois, car c'est clair qu'il y en aura !Seul bémol : le confort des chaises ... Un café aussi bon se doit d'être dégusté de manière plus "cosy" !Aussi mention spéciale pour l'utilisation du système Chemex ! Je ne pensais pas le trouver dans un commerce !
strong. bitter. acidic. best in moderation.not only are they open somewhat late but they are tucked away from the busy quartier latin main street making it not as sought as people rarely venture that far off from st-denis. sitting right near the movie theater, it's a great place to grab a coffee before a showing or if you're waiting for friends to show up before a night of drinking or if you're waiting for a table because the place you want to go is full and you left your number for a call back.it is not really made for studying though as the tables are quite small leaving you not much space.staff is very friendly and price wise, st-henri coffee has always been on the high end of independent coffee so expect to pay a bit more.nonetheless, amongst the many chains in quartier latin, it's good to have standouts
I finally found a coffee shop in town that does pourovers and it did not disappoint! So tasty I didn't need milk or sugar in my coffee and that happens so rarely. I must go back for a French press!
Their espresso is perfectly made; As such, their Americano is absolute perfection. This third-wave coffee shop always makes my evenings with my wife very special. There is something about the coffee and ambiance here that makes the conversations ever-so deep.Perfection; Absolute perfection. May this place remain perfect and exist as such forever across time and space.If I lived near this coffee shop, I would visit it many times a week.
My husband and I really enjoyed our visit at Café St-Henri Émery. Their small little shop is simple and intimate, and their coffee tastes very good. Our barista was very passionate about coffee and explained us well the differences between the grains available. I recommend the latte with almond milk; it's delicious! We will visit again for sure :)
One of the best places to get a coffee in Montreal, and tucked away down a small street. Staff are friendly and great small cafe atmosphere.
A cute little place close to St. Denis. Yes it is charming and quiet, but maybe not a very optimal place for studying if you need access to a plug. They are located up high and hard to use unless you have a super long cord for your laptop. Temperature was cold at first but the barista increased it when I asked.
Lovely little spot tucked down a pretty alley off lower St Denis, right where you might hope an exceptional cafe would be. Run by the St Henri folks, these beans are local and the roast is strong, clear and delicious. There's not many who can manage to balance taking something like coffee extremely seriously with a long list of coffee menu items at the door, detailed questions asked by the skilled baristas, beverages delivered with cloth napkin, cool water,  filtered coffee made in small batches for you with love; and love is the operative word. Not pretentious, not showy, just interested in care and craft and providing a wonderful experience. Enjoy your coffee, relax in the old wooden chairs rescued from local schools, rubbed smooth by generations. Maybe think about things like craft, learning and love. Or maybe just enjoy that sweet good coffee buzz. Your call.
I love the coffee here and the wait staff is super friend. The atmosphere is nice, though it can be hard to find a space.
If you love small, quirky, university town coffee houses this is the place for you. The big chains have conditioned me to know that the people serving the coffee know nothing about the beans. I entered and ordered, and then noticed the server was making herself a coffee...with a press and a timer!  Ok, let's see.  "What's you best coffee today?"  What she said nearly made me cry.  She KNEW coffee.  As we talked she even recommended other shops.  What a great place!
A quiet cafe just off St. Denis in the Latin Quarter on a quiet street called Rue Emery that you may not spot right away. Look for a teal round lit sign sticking out that says "cafe". The mocha was $4.75 which is comparable to most places in Montreal though the drink was a bit too smokey and dark and the chocolate was a bit gritty for my tastes. BUT, the barista I encountered here was super passionate about coffee and all things related. I was engaged in a very informative conversation with the barista; he told me a lot about the coffee scene here in Montreal and mentioned a few other recommendations. Loved his enthusiasm.
Hand pull, four grinders with beans of various origins, sweet espresso... Yes this is a place for the espresso hounds, coffee geeks, and pull purists.  As someone else noted, your espresso comes with a glass of water (no plastic) and a cloth napkin. Tres elegant.My major gripe: they open at 10. If they are striving to be an Institution, they need better hours. But perhaps the locals going to work are not in their audience?In any case, there really isn't much good coffee in this part of town, so if you're an espresso hound finding yourself near Berri-UQAM, this is your place.
This place is a must if in Montreal. Bought a bag of whole beans, was given a free espresso & cookie (no promises). Had a great conversation with the barista. Comparable to Blue Bottle.
Located near the end of a quiet street, this neighborhood cafe serves up delicious pastries and quality coffee with a dash of personality. Though it's not really staffed to handle large groups of visitors, the server was extremely friendly, helpful, and patient.  They feature African (Kenyan, this time) and South American beans.  If you don't like strong, herbal, slightly bitter coffee, try the South American beans instead. They also offer tea from the store a few doors down.
This is a cool little cafe just off busy St. Catherine street. They are open late and it is never too busy. Great coffee and you get free sparking water to cleanse the palate with every drink along with a cloth napkin. I love it!Didn't try the pastries as it was late in the day, I also found the chairs to be not the best for hanging out long term.
Good coffee, although the roast and espresso are a little on the darker side.  Good if you like your coffee strong.  Also, their sweet potato muffin was fantastic.  Quiet atmosphere, so its good for reading but probably not for socializing.
Great little place that makes you feel comfortable. The space is quite small but not cramped. I liked how when you make your order the barista offers you a glass of sparkling or flat water. The decor is cool with wooden chairs, small tables, music stands to showcase the menu and warm lighting. My macchiato was tasty and I like the cup it was served in. I didn't order anything else, but the pastries looked really good. To sum: friendly service, good ambiance, tasty coffee. 2 thumbs up.
I was wandering around the St. Denis area looking for a coffee shop to hang out at for a while and stumbled on this one, and was glad I did! Although really close to St. Denis, Cafe St Henri Emery was a little hidden if not for the "Cafe" sign. It was quiet in there with only a couple of folks, and was a really nice place to get out of the cold and relax and read for a little while. I really liked the quiet atmosphere. The cappuccino was excellent and well made, with local espresso. I ended up spending maybe 3 hours here, and could tell it was a local hangout or study place. I highly recommend if you're in that area to stop in!
Ah, Cafe St. Henri is my little oasis near my work. We have a decent automatic espresso machine in the office, but nothing beats an expertly pulled espresso.Attention to detail is what makes this place shine...you know just by the way the barista measures and re-measures to get the perfect tamp.I usually get a single espresso, a chug of water to cleanse the palate and I'm on my way out.Quiet atmosphere, great place to read or have a friendly chat.
In a city full of great coffee places and pastries, Café St. Henri is quite deserving of another rave review.  Despite our group overwhelming the small staff, everything was A-okay.  All our coffee drinks came with a palate cleansing shot of sparkling water (nifty idea). My very pretty latte was one of the best tasting I've ever had....and I've had many.  And the berry muffins were amazing, fluffy and chock full of actual fruit.  Can you ship some to me please?!
The espresso here is delicious. The latte is indescribable because it's perfection. The barista is really nice and bilingual. The atmosphere is pretty chill too.
An excellent little place. A manual machine run by a guy who knows what he's doing. Delicious muffins. Certainly on the top shelf of Montrèal's espresso joints, with their antecedent in St-Henri and Humble Lion.
GREAT place ,great stuff ,  coffee , very comfortable place to drink ur coffee ,u must try it as sooooooon as possible. I went with my frnd and it was amazing
A warm and cozy little gem hidden on a small offshoot from the busy Rue St. Denis. Cafe St Henri has fantastic coffee, well sourced and excellently prepared. Amazing! They also serve you coffee with the a cloth napkin and water to cleanse your taste buds beforehand. The baristas were dressed up in fancy clothing (dress shirt with waistcoat), befitting of the wonderful "theatresque" setting in the shop. Friendly baristas, awesome service. Cafe St Henri is a must-visit for all coffee lovers in Montreal!
Third Wave coffee @ it's bestWhat a great find. Nestled as the back of Hotel St Denis is this charming locale. So perfect in every way. Self and boy friend popped in one mid week morning in early November around 8:30am, I believe that it stays open until 10pm. Just one or two other customers. Our highly entertaining, engaging and thoroughly skillful Barista gave us a wonderful experience.  Shame I didn't ask for his name. We placed our order for a cappuccino and a drip coffee as well and accepted his recommendation for the most scrumptious sweet potato muffin and delicious almond croissant and were asked to take a seat. Now knowing that artisanal coffee takes time we were really taken in with the ambiance and vibe of Cafe St Henri. The photos on Yelp will give you a perfect birds eye view of the restaurant's interiors.Soon enough our Barista served up our coffees and pastries, along with cute glasses filled with good water and linen napkins. Because he wasn't so busy just then we were able to engage in conversation with him relating to third wave coffee in Montreal versus our hometown of NYC. He explained the history behind the coffee used at the cafe and the roasting. And just like a previous Yelp Reviewer mentioned, coffee made in small batches is truly coffee at its best.We fell in love. You just couldn't help it. Everything that should be right about a coffee experience was there at Cafe St Henri. It's so worth putting on your schedule to stop in when in Montreal and if you're a local who hasn't yet been? Well, you are missing out....Thanks guys and great job at service, food and coffee.
The layout is super cool: like a movie theater complete with a vast menu of coffee choices. I stuck with a plain old latte, but it was perfectly roasted and absolutely delicious. I love the colours of their glassware and the option of still or sparkling water to accompany your coffee.The service was impeccable and for the quality of the coffee, they don't even try to gauge you price-wise. I will most definitely be back as I had my eye on a cranberry/macadamia cookie that looked amazing and a half.
This microbrewery housed in a renovated modern space in what used to be a nunnery serves up some tasty beer. The space is perhaps a bit too modern as it felt a little too trendy, though perhaps because it was largely empty around lunch time on a weekday. With a larger crowd it might feel more appropriate. It was pretty awesome to watch the brewery in operation right behind the window inside though and made the beer taste super fresh. The service was incredibly friendly and helpful about the beer. They don't have a huge selection as they are still pretty small compared to many other brewpubs in the city. The beer they do have though is reflective of the focus and attention to detail being a smaller brewery forces on them. The golden ale was bright and crisp and flowing with flavor. If they continue to make beer this good, they'll be growing in no time.
It's a shame that we only had the one lunchtime to try this restaurant. I would have loved to give it another chance - the ambiance seemed like it would be a nice place to make your 'local' for slightly higher class (and price) food and after work drinks. Unfortunately we went during poutine week (apparently a thing in Montreal :-)) and they were packed. Thankfully we'd made reservations since we were a larger than average group. Not only was it loud (in a boisterous friendly way), they ran out of poutine (!!). The food we had instead was good and a generous enough portion for a mini express lunch. In short, we had fun, but it was a shame they didn't realize how popular they'd be and couldn't plan ahead.
We had the $16 lunch menu. The boar burger was pretty good, try it.  The pulled pork sandwich was decent but the potato soup was too salty, the potato salad was smoky and unflavored and the coleslaw side was tasteless as well. So in essence, I paid $16 for the burger.
Waited forever to orderThe food has not been seasonedCOMPLETELY OVERPRICEDWasted $30 on a plate full of unseasoned chicken. fucking disappointed
Am I in Montréal? Why am I listening to loud American classic rock music? Why do I think it's loud? Am I turning into an grumpy old person? OK no time to go there! Just enjoy the yummy food & drinks!3 appetizers, 1 cider, 1 beer and 1 main course= $36.76. Five of us were full and happy! Must order: CHOUCROUTE GARNIE-Beer and smoked boar sauerkraut with potatoes and bacon! Super hearty and delicious.*Note- there are three price points ($12, $14, $18) for the main course menus based on the portion size!
Well done! Brief beer menu, but what was available was phenomenal. Service a bit slow, but it being Canada day I'd give them the benefit of a doubt they were somewhat understaffed. Will be back to sample a more unique menu!
Beers were very good, ribs fall-off-the-bone tender, poutine a rather insane but admittedly tasty variation on the usual. Staff were friendly and we got a table very easily.
Awesome beer and excellent tapas!  Really like everything here and one of the few restaurants I seek out on a Montreal trip!
Another micro-brewerie, the beer is good i tried the white beer Camelia ( a tip to la dame des Camelia from Sarah Bernard !), it was a good white beer with a little aftertaste of sencha tea i like it as it's a genuine beer you can't  find at every corner.As for the meal it's a bit pricey as the main course are just a plate without fries or veggies, i order the wild meat stew with deer and buffalo and it was good but you don't have anything else on the platte and for 18$ i expected more than just a stew.My friends ordered grilled cheese that were good but a bit expensive at 12$.So it's a micro-brewery that expect young professionals to pay more for less in their plate but the beer is excellent.Bon un autre micro-brasserie à Montréal ! La bière est excellent j'ai  gouté la camélia (une allusion à la pièce de théâtre La dame au Camélia de Sarah Bernard !). C'Est une excellente bière blanche avec un arrière goût original de thé sencha .Il y a des bières originales que vous ne trouverez pas à chaque coin de rue comme les bière des 3 brasseurs !Pour le repas j'ai commencé le ragout de gibier avec bison et cerf et c'était excellent quoique pour 18 $ j'aurai espéré des frites ou une salade compris avec  l'assiette.En résumé c'est une micro-brasserie pour jeunes professionnels dont ça ne leurs dérange pas de payer plus pour avoir  moins dans leurs assiettes mais plus de qualité !Donc je ne sais si je retournerai à cette micro-brasserie, mais pour la très bonne bière c'est un excellent endroit !
Rude staff, got a lot of eye rolling and attitude when I asked her to repeat one of the options. Had the duck salad, was limp and drowned in an awful sweet sauce.
Arriving midnight after Igloofest this lower McGill street bistro wasn't packed and wasn't screeching with bumpcha bumpcha so we ducked in and sat on the couch against the wall and ordered giant mugs of stout, nuts, olives and homemade spicy beef jerky. The service was perfect; always there when you wanted it but discreetly disappeared when you were deep into a conversation, and even when we lost track of time and talked till 3pm we were never given the slightest hint of rush. The stout was delicious and giant mugs are both economical and swashbuckling, and the long list of beer imports certainly had me curious to come back for more. The snacks were fine, and gladly received given that the kitchen was already closed. The decor rubbed me the wrong way. Though the lighting is sexy and dim and attractive and the space holds all kinds of potential there is this forced "modernness" that is actually very 90's dated, cold and uncomfortable. Why all these hard chairs, and stiff couches with half backs where you hit your head if you lean back? Why with the window treatment of cold angled slabs, why so much metal and white? I'd love to see more stone, wood, a fireplace, a connection to the actual space and history all around in Old Montreal and even right there in the name. Huge potential here and I'll come back, but my quest for the perfect cozy Old Montreal bar continues.
Nice interior. Good service. Pretty good menu. (Potato is so so.) Beer is decent. Not too loud. Overall pretty good.
Great microbrewery! Walking through Old Monteal, we stumbled upon this place and decided to try it out. Really cool vibe - modern, clean look. Excellent beer on tap and great food. We loved the tapas - cool variety of unique options. We were really impressed with the service, as they made great recommendations for food and drinks.
Nice place.. the decor is a little odd (metal, glass, plastic), but  the ambiance was low-key. The two beers I had were excellent -  'Ninja IPA' +' I'm Batman' Imperial Stout.
Went there last friday evening before the fireworks at the Old Port. Place was busy... busy with loud (and drunk) men... The beers were good though not exceptionnal (tried the stout and the blonde). The food was good but you have to like smokey. We had the pork sandwich and the ribs. Plates were very small for the price and we left still hungry!
Two glasses of wine (30 dollars) on a windy sidewalk as the sun was setting. The service was friendly.
A new microbrewery in Montreal... one would be tempted to say what's new ? well everything. First thing to be reviewed in a brewery is the beer. The General Manager of this business has a long experience in brewing and it shows. These beers are just as good or better than what you would get at Brasseurs de Montreal, L'Amere A Boire and other good locations for beer. They have a decent choice. I tried many and they are all delicious in their own style. They also import rare beers. In short it is clear that the owners have a passion for excellent beer and deep knowledge. The staff is knowledgeable too and able to comment and make valid suggestions.Then comes the location. It is located in my favorite area of Old Montreal. Not right in the middle of the tourist traps, just a little bit west, where the real Montrealer has its quarters. The building belongs to the religious community of Les Soeurs Grises or used to (that remains to be clarified) and has been renovated with simplicity, sobriety and taste. You really feel comfortable to stay a long time there.Where the real surprise was, which prompted me to give 5 stars, was the quality of the food. They have a tapas menu and a bistro food menu, but none of them are standard fare. They all have their special twist. I had a grill cheese complete with Charlevoix cheese, chorizo and fig jam... it was pure pleasure. I love sandwiches but I never thought I could love them so much ! my friend had a BLT which he enjoyed thoroughly too. Next time I'm definitely going for the hot dog !I think this place is definitely going to become my spot for the months to come and I strongly suggest people to try it.
Dined here looking for a casual night out. Their specialty is artisanal beer coupled with anything smoked. I ordered smoked trout ($14) and a sauerkraut side ($4). Duck drumsticks w coke+cream dipping sauce to start ($8) and a brownie to finish ($6). Everything tasted good, the duck meat was tender and fell straight off the bone. Good beer selection too. The atmosphere was nice, however the table next to us was very loud and spoiled the ambience a bit. Too bad, but we'll be back!
I visited for the green tea bingsoo, the small size and I bought it to share! It was that big!! The bingsoo is shaved ice (very very very fine ice shaving, like very fine coconut shavings) plus GENEROUS green tea paste. It's not liquid syrup, it's like ice-cream texture! And lots of it! By the bottom of the bingsoo, we actually had MORE green tea left than the ice. So we have to mix it further.Very good service!!! The petite size bingsoo was about $8 but it's shareable. There are about 5 tables in this small cafe.
Green tea (matcha) bingsoo was A-MAZING! The small size is a rather big portion. Also the price comes down to about 10$ after taxes. I wish they served an XS size.
There was a week in October when I went for bingsoo three times. It was a good week.I think I've tried all the bingsoos, but my favorite is the mango one!!!
Awesome Korean pastry place~ I've been there many times and their patbingsu is a killing. This time, I tried the Strawberry one. It became my favorite flavour LOOOL. So fancy, the shaved ice literally MELT in your mouth. Food art is beautiful. Fruit game is strong. Totally good place for a date or dessert after a meal. I also tried their strawberry cake and green tea cake. Both are amazing. The flavour is strong. Food art is nice. I also tried the red beans one. I was disappointed. Red beans are on the top and it's full of peanuts. It's not what I was expected. Green tea and strawberry. Must try. Kpop music on big screen. Ambiance is relaxing.Overall good experience. Best patbingsu in Montreal so far.
Definitely should try their bingsoo!! The portions are big and they are authentic and delicious! You can mix and match, but only red bean and matcha. The bakeries there are awesome too! I love the puff and the bread. According to my friend, the strawberry cake there is good too. They have a discount for bread after 7pm or something.
Food: 4.5/5Service: 4/5Cleanliness: 4/5Price: 4.5/5What does Le Painnamou even mean? The word is fusion - obviously the first part (pain) means bread in French, and the latter part (namou) is Korean for tree. Together, bread tree!!!! Haha. Anyway, the name suits the little bakery perfectly and as I love Korean baked goodies, this place is a total gem in my books.The selection of bread they have is small but great; many of its selection is sold out when I visit too late during the day (tells you how popular this place can be!). During the Summer, my husband and I frequented the bakery on a regular basis to cool ourselves down during the hot and humid weather with their shaved ice dessert.This dessert is very popular in East Asia, and many of the countries have their own authentic versions of this dessert. In Korea, shaved ice has particularly been more popular than ever during the last two years even though the dessert itself has traditionally been served for over decades. The modernized shaved ice is almost always sold in any Korean bakery or cafe you visit, and Montreal is no exception. Le Painnamou has had one of the best and most authentic shaved ice we had ever tried, beating its competitors in Seoul, Los Angeles, Toronto and Vancouver!What makes the shaved ice at Le Painnamou better? Hubby and I believe it's the quality of the ice, which is pre-mixed with condensed milk then finely shaved to give it a dry texture that instantly melts in your mouth. The ice doesn't melt as you enjoy your dessert, which I find is very important. The bakery is also very generous when it comes to its toppings; we've visited many cafes where we were left with just regular ice at the end because there was a shortage of toppings.Our favourite flavours are the green tea and strawberry shaved ice, but there are many more to choose from! Mango, coffee, traditional red bean, chocolate... there is a flavour for everyone and each flavour can also be enjoyed by all ages! And it's very affordable as well - the dessert is available in 3 sizes (small, medium, and large) and all are under $10.Ever wondered if you can take the dessert to go?Well, you can! Hubby and I visited Le Painnamou one day in September to find it completely full with no place to sit. We asked if it was possible to have it to go...and we were surprised that they were able to do it! After receiving our dessert, we enjoyed the shaved ice outside (it was still warm back then). We quite liked the to-go version; it was very well thought out and efficient!So, before it gets any colder in Montreal, I recommend you head over to Le Painnamou and try one of their shaved ice desserts! Nestled right around Guy-Concordia, it's a great way to treat yourself after a long day of school or work, plus it's not that high in calories (at least I think...it's ice after all). We hope you enjoy it as much as we do!
Have been here twice now, tried the chocolate, pineapple and mango bingsoo. These are exactly what you need in this very hot Montreal summer! The shaved ice is very fine with milk favour. In addition, the fruits add another dimension to the dessert. Overall, not too sweet but super refreshing! This has become my favourite dessert place in Montreal. The reason I gave 4 star is they can never get your name right, my name always ends up being very "creative", which is kinda annoying.
Went there for their Bingsoo (Korean milk shaved ice). Perfect on this hot and humid summer day. 3 sizes available. ..we were greedy and took 2 medium bowls. Don't be fooled because they fill - up the bowl so it's like double the portion. If you are by yourself, take the small bowl. Medium bowl us best for sharing. Big bowl...at your own risk :pBingsoo flavor:Red bean (decent)Green teaChocolateMango (amazing)Strawberry (lacks flavors mainly because they use strawberries from the US)Pineapple Also tried the sweet potato smoothie and the flavor was interesting. ..really tasted like sweet potato but not sure I will order it again. Tried the strawberry cake and it was good but not amazing especially for the price (over $5 for a tiny piece).They also serve pastries, sandwiches and coffee. Definitely more pricey that chinese bakeries.Cash and debit only.
I went there a few times. Pretty flavorful bingsoos. Although my favorite is the red bean flavor, it was disappointing. It was basically red bean on top of the shaved ice. It was hard to mix both of them. Beside that, the other flavors have a layer of sauce which keeps the shaved ice flavorful. It is worth going there to try their sweets.
I went here with a couple of friends during our trip to Montreal.  I wanted to treat them to a nice patisserie but couldn't find one so we stumbled into this place.  We lucked out as this place had one of the best desserts ever.  We got the cream puffs, hot chocolate and the strawberry and green tea bingsoos (Korean shaved ice dessert). Highly recommended to visit.Food: 5/5, best bingsoo I've ever had in Canada. Snowflake and light ice that didn't melt at all with multiple layers of strawberry sauce and fruit at the top with sweet condensed milk and rice cake.  Service: 4/5, nice staff and everything was available.Ambience: 4/5, cool Christmas K-pop music with nice seating and very well-lit. The place also looked really clean.Price: 4/5. $10 per person which is not bad; the food is really good and totally worth it.
Ive been to this place several times and just keep going for the bingsoo. It comes in various flavours and so far the strawberry and mango ones were delicious. Unlike your usual shaved ice, this one is creamy and actually has a flavour of its own. Nothing to complain about the service, as they were pretty friendly. I would definitely visit this place again.
Their shaved ice cream is great! It's also a big portion, so I believe the small is enough for one person, or even to share with a friend. The only downside is to make sure they understood your order, else you get something different! - in my case, I asked for the mango flavor shaved ice cream. But instead I got the green tea flavor one. Else, it's a cute place.
I absolutely loved their bingsoo! It was soo good! The shaved ice melts in your mouth! I definitely recommend everyone to go especially in this very hot day in Montreal! I tried the green tea one which I was very scared of my decision but it was really good.Next time I'll be trying the strawberry or mango one.Bingsoo is a Korean shaved ice dessert that can have many sweet toppings such as fruits like mango, strawberry, condensed milk, chocolate syrup or simply sweet syrup. They're might be nuts for those who have allergies.  yum!
As expected bingsoos are the best on a hot summer day. I've been back and have tried both the strawberry and the red beans flavours. Strawberry was slightly too sweet and red beans was somehow too dry. Matcha is still my favourite.
Super good when you are craving for something sweet and refreshing. I recommend the mango because it's worth the cost and in my opinion the best compared to others. The dessert itself is filled with layers of sweetened shaved ice and mangos, topped with mochi. I use to always ask for extra mochi because it was really good and sweet, but now they make it dry and tastes like dough. Price is decent, not too expensive. Definitely recommend!
Le Painnamou is a cute little Korean bakery on Bishop with their most popular item being their bingsoo selection. On this occasion, my friends and I had the red bean bingsoo and also decided to try their new pineapple flavour. The red bean is definitely one of my favourites: red bean isn't too sweet, shaved ice is soft and fluffy, and the mochi also adds a nice touch! I personally wasn't a big fan of the pineapple flavour but the pineapple was still very fresh nonetheless. Left the bakery feeling satisfied like always!
Cute little bakery. Clean and friendly. K-pop videos playing on a screen. Ordered a small chocolate bingsoo, but the servings are huge. Definitely could've split this with one of my friends, which a lot of people were actually doing while we were there. The bingsoo was served with brownie pieces and marshmallows . It was so delicious and refreshing! My friends ordered mango and strawberry bingsoos, which they both loved. Ended up buying a coffee bun (honey flavor) to take home. It was very sweet and moist. Definitely will come back, when in Montreal!
This place needs more recognition! Today was my second time visiting this cute little pretty brand new Korean bakery on Bishop. My first visit I had the green tea bingsoo which is a Korean shaved ice. It was not too sweet, and was like a fancy, interesting, icy cold dessert with a mixture of green tea and what I thought were marshmallows but were (I think) rice dough/cake pieces. My Korean friend told me this particular bakery specializes in bing soo, so if it's your first time and you don't know what to order, go for the bingsoo! You will not be disappointed. They have mango, red bean, green tea etc. I'm not sure which one is the best, but I don't think you can go wrong with any of those options.My second visit, I had a latte and pizza baguette, with a red bean bun that I was supposed to save for my bf but ended up eating a chunk of it with my latte. Both were quite good. They aren't jam packed with flavors the buns and the baguette, but it's still good. I think it might be a good thing because it isn't overly sweet or saucy. The atmosphere of the place is very clean and modern. I really like it. I highly recommend visiting this bakery for a snack/dessert/coffee break if you are a Concordia student/live in the Guy area, or are downtown looking for a sweet spot to check out. Go go go!
Everything is so good from here!!i tried the tiramisu,they made that better than the Italian,it's not a joke!!it's just so good!!and I tried also the coffee bun and the moka bread,delicious!!!i'll be back here for sure!!
The best bingsoo I've had in Montreal hands down. Very quaint little bakery but have never tried the baked goods haha. They have lots of flavors too, but red bean and mango are definitely worth trying. Most bingsoos are made on ice or sugared ice but they actually make the ice from some type of milk/cream base! Everyone comes here for the bingsoo but make sure to try the honey toast as well! I feel like less people know about it but its just as good fosho.
Friendly employees and very welcoming. Perfect place for a date. The food was great too. Totally worth your money and it's right in front of Concordia for students who need to unplug.
This place is amazing! The bingsoo is a must order! I don't normally like eating bingsoo that much, but it looked so good that I knew I had to order it. The bakery has very reasonable prices and everything looked delicious. :)
TASTE OF KOREA. I've never had such good Bingsoo in Canada before. If you're a Bingsoo lover, you'll be able to finish a small bingsoo by yourself! Green tea & just regular red bean bingsoo are so good!
I love this place so much! It's really clean and cute, although I wish this place was bigger so. They have all kinds of korean food and pastries. The staff was really friendly. I ordered a small chocolate bingsoo and my friend ordered a small strawberry bingsoo.(bingsoo is basically korean shaved ice, sounds bland but it's very good!) We didn't wait that long for it to be made. There's a television that plays kpop music videos the whole time, which I enjoyed a lot since I listen to kpop. When your food is ready, you have pick it up from the counter. Representation was spot on! It was well prepared and looks so good. The small was quite big for me so I shared with my friend (I usually eat little so if you want to share with a friend you can order a medium size)The chocolate bingsoo was amazing, it had chocolate syrup, almonds, brownies and pieces of mochi. The strawberry bingsoo, had slice strawberries on top with almonds and pieces of mochi, they had some strawberry syrup under as well. It taste amazing and I will definitely go back there on a hot summer day for their bingsoo!
After living in Korea for a year, this place was disappointing. They don't even serve Korean drinks. I've been craving a sweet potato latte for the longest time. I was also hoping this cafe would be more like an upscale Paris Baguette. Not so much.
We ordered mango and matcha bingso. They used milk instead of ice. Best bingso I've ever had.
Went earlier today after hearing good reviews about the bakery on yelp. We got the strawberry bingsoo andbit was delicious! The shaved ice was creamy like it was made of milk and the strawberry was just so fresh! Combined it with the mochie and almond pieces made the desert a  very refreshing and yummy dish. We also grabbed a  couple of pastries to go and they were great as well. They had very interesting taste, sweet creamy and yet still savoury at the same time.
Brand new (only opened 1 week ago) Korean bakery/pastry store/cafe. Many Korean specialties (chestnut bread) as well as Western delights:fudge brownies(yummy& just right consistency),lunch breads,from pizza baguette to calmari-stuffed blackish bread stick! There are several tables at the side and back of the store,the baked goods are well displayed,hygenically sealed,or glass encased,easily accessible, (the cakes and pastries are behind the refrigerated glass counter),and competitively priced. The location is directly across from the Concordia University's Hall building ,so come this school year,this shop should be doing a very brisk business indeed.
I LOVED THIS PLACE!! Not only was the amosphere bright and cheerfeul, but the food was AMAZING!! I ordered the morning rolls and red bean pastry. And if that were not enough, there is a huge screen that plays Kpop videos right there in the shop!! IT WAS MY IDEA OF HEAVEN!! The staff was also very friendly. I just discovered this place last night. I will be a regular for sure :)
My wife and I had to find a caterer only five weeks ahead of our wedding.  Kimberly and her team at Miss Prêt à Manger (our main contacts there were Zoe Dascher and Jonathan Albert) answered every question and request that we had extremely quickly and set up tastings for us in no time. They were attentive to what we wanted, to our budget and soooo helpful. We were given great assistance with everything from wine and drink selection to finding a DJ.On the day of the wedding, everything went off beautifully. The staff were a well-oiled machine - but a machine that was attentive to us and to our guests. All of the food was delicious, guests' wine glasses were kept full, wine was served at the right temperature, drinks were mixed exactly right and we could not have been more pleased.To be honest, we were a little concerned because we knew that Miss Prêt was also catering two large events on the same night as us and there was always the lurking fear that our little event might be put on the back burner.  Wrong.  It may be that the personnel we had was the "C" team but even the "C" team was impeccable.  It is rare to find an organisation that does carries  its mission with soul and with tremendous organizational skill.  Miss Prêt à Manger carries this off with aplomb.Recommended without reservation or hesitation.
Let me start off by saying that I haven't eaten here yet. Why, do you ask, am I writing a review if I haven't eaten here? Because so far, the service has been exceptional.I'm getting married and was looking for a caterer. After going through about 50 different places and getting quotes, I landed on this business. I did some research online and saw that almost every single review was raving about Miss Pret a Manger.Kim & Zoe have been so helpful and patient (yea I'm a bit intense.. I'm European. That's my excuse and I'm sticking to it) with aiding me in choosing a menu specifically to suit my needs. Every single email was answered almost immediately and every phone message was returned within the day.So far, I can totally see why everyone is raving about the service at Miss Pret a Manger and I cannot wait to see what Kim & Zoe have in store for me food wise on that special day!!
The food is sensational. Beyond expectations. It is also very sanitary and health-conscious. The overall aura of the restaurant is super mellow. Thanks, Miss Prêt!Now, onto her music. I've been following her SoundCloud (@labluesy), soooo good! Her playlist is my playlist now.Thanks for catering the McGill Management International Case Competition. We had a blast!
I had the Asian sensation salad - made up with a big mess of really fresh vegetables; lettuce, shaved Napa cabbage, scallions, carrots, celery, spinach, red cabbage, tomatoes, chopped parsley and everything good for you that you know you should be eating. The salad is topped with a bundle of sesame peppered cold soba noodles and seared sesame crusted tuna with citrusy-soy tataki sauce. Jokes aside, the thing was substantial, paired with the trio of salads to start with, my insides were burning from all the vitamins and rainbows and smiley emoticons.I was full. Could it have been the slices of bacon or blue cheese baguette? Probably not. It's rare that I would write so encouragingly about a friggin salad, but I am - so please go out and purchase your lotto tickets accordingly. Yes, breakfast is most important meal of the day, but I strongly believe lunch comes in a close second. A meal that will provide you enough energy to sustain you through the afternoon before your evening dranks is equally as important, but not as important as keeping you awake and not knocking you out with a food coma once you get back to work. With a never ending rotating roster of inspired and healthy lunch specials, it's a great alternative for people who need a quick bite to go, or have the time to sit down for a proper lunch - all food groups represented.
If you have a special event that you want catered - you will not go wrong with Miss Pret a Manger. Kimberly Lallouz and her team were exceptional. We had a 50 people wedding party in our home that they catered. Miss Pret made it one of the nicest evenings I have ever had. The food was absolutely outstanding, the service was amazing, they cleaned up beautiful, they were fun (Zoe even danced with us a bit!) .. I can not say enough good things about these people. Thank you for making our wedding party a memorable, fun, delicious and amazing evening! Heidi & Lenny
Options for lunch in that neighborhood? The pickins' are slim, Jim! By and far, Miss Pret has the healthiest food on that dismal block (everything else is burgers and beer). However, the portions are teeny-tiny. I went a few times, each time ordering a different salad combo (yum!). But they would fill most of the to-go container (about two-thirds) with a few pieces of big lettuce leaves so that the main only filled one-third of the box. Each time I was left going, 'ok, so where do I go for a real meal now?' The kitchen also re-uses so many of the main ingredients across plates that in fact, you're left with few options in the end. i.e.) sweet potato is in many dishes, as is spinach etc.Every time I've visited they seem to be overstaffed (sometimes 8 people visible behind the counter when there are only 2 customers), and yet I've had to wait very long for my food.
I sampled the canapes at Yelp's Belle Mo event, which were provided by Miss Pret a Manger. I have to say, the ones I tried were not only delicious, but also really well-presented and cleverly put together. Canapes can sometimes get a bit dull, if you're going to a lot of events, and for anyone who is hosting an event and looking for something a bit different, I can highly recommend Miss Pret a Manger. The vegetarian cocktail sticks, with tomatoes and cheese were gorgeous, and the salmon pate was served generously on the crostinis.
This place was wonderful, possibly my favorite meal in Montreal so far! Go here! The staff was super friendly and very attentive, more than I can say for other dining experiences in this city. They were cheery and helpful, translating the entire menu into English for us with no attitude or annoying looks. We ordered and in the meantime were served a little taster size cup of their soup of the day, and brought out some little breads that had blue cheese and walnuts(!!!) Delicious. Our entrees were large and the healthiest looking things we had eaten since we arrived here. I had the salmon tartar, which was mixed with avocado and mango, and came with a behemoth sized salad. My boyfriend had the grilled bass which came on a bed of broccoli rabe and rice, topped with some sort of Mediterranean salsa. Both were fantastic. The tartar seemed to have the perfect ratio of avocado to fish so it wasn't goopy or anything, his bass paired with the greens was a wonderful combination as well. We split a "famous bar" for dessert, a graham cracker crust bar topped with chocolate, coconut, nuts, etc, which was the perfect sized sweet treat for after such a lovely meal. The prices seem about right for Montreal restaurants, and with such a friendly staff and fun ambiance I wish I was staying longer in the city so I could go back!
I stopped in at this restaurant for lunch on my last visit to Montreal. It was around 2 p.m., following the lunch 'rush'. I was greeted by Kimberly who was sitting at a table working on her computer. I was offered a table by the window, which is perfect on a rainy day to watch life go by.I ordered the Asian chicken soup, and a Salad with grilled chicken. Service was warm and friendly and very attentive. Chatted with Kimberly who interacted with every customer that walked in the door. Many customers are on a first name basis with the owner (Kimberly) and enjoy the personal attention.There is an open kitchen concept with plenty of amazing aromas finding their way in to the dining room. The food was great, beautiful presentation. Dessert ( Kimberley's carrot cake) was a must even though I was stuffed!This restaurant is not open in the evenings, so lunch is your only chance to enjoy this great venue.Say hello to Kimberly for me!
A chic bakery serving delicious pastries, coffee and small dessert items.  The breakfast pastries were light , fluffy, and full of flavors.  It has a lovey interior.  It's great for a leisure stop to enjoy the beautiful interior decor or grab and go.
Cozy and adorable little spot on Amherst serving pastries, sandwiches and salads. The coffee is not great (the cappuccino in a mug is HUGE, equivalent to a latte in general coffee standards) but the sandwiches and salads are unique and tasty. Loved the pan fried pork panini!Great little spot to sit and enjoy a book on a sunny winter day :)
I visited this cafe because it was walking distance from where I stayed, but it left me pleasantly surprised!I ordered a breakfast wrap that tasted more among the lines of a breakfast burrito, and my friend ordered a breakfast bowl with melted chocolate, nuts, and fresh fruit.I would give 3 stars for my order (nothing special) and 5 stars for my friend's order. It tasted divine! The gooey chocolate with berries, passionfruit, peaches combined with the almond slivers somehow had complex flavours that left me wanting more. I still remember the taste so clearly, and I hope they keep this gem on the menu!
I absolutely love this place!!The whole front is opened up (in the summer of course) making the atmosphere that much more amazing. White and simple interior that is stunning!Coffee and food are great. Nothing too mind blowing. Cute pastries and delicious sandwiches. My favourite and go-to is the TONKATSU. It's pork that is pan fried and the combo of ingredients is so yummy!! There are some laptop restrictions but this is a great place to go and catch up with a friend or read a book. - @cchehade
Let's start with the pros: 1. What a lovely place! I really didn't expect it, specially in this area! The interior design is really great.2. The food looks awesome! It's a decoration by itself. Now the cons: 1. Unfortunately, the food is not as tasty as it looks (greasy or too sweet), which is even more disappointing considering the average price.2. Laptop owners be aware that during lunch break (starting at 11.30 am) you won't be allowed to stay in the common area, you'll have to seat at the counter, the very smelly one (right in front of the kitchen), even if the place is totally empty. 3. It is veryyyy quiet. Don't expect to meet or talk to anyone here, as it is clearly not the purpose. Basically it's the kinda place where you feel lonely, but if it's what you aim for, go for it! Bring a book, and it would be your best friend!
Quite a big café, grabbed a cheesecake, quite good, didn't like the base though, not moist enough
Excellent pastries and paninis. They serve a daily soup indicated on the menu board posted on the wall.
Super cute café located in the village. Lots of Pinterest-like details in their charming decor. Not a lot of space so it gets filled here quickly, esp on weekends. I opted for the cappuccino bowl and it was HUGE. It was good but I couldn't finish it. Their egg sandwiches are wonderfully constructed. ****Free WiFi!
This is a quaint little bakery and teahouse. The prices were reasonable and the atmosphere was charming (light jazz). My wife enjoyed her chai chocolate and I had an Assam tea (kind of like English breakfast). Be careful of the milk dispensers.Overall, I would rate it as a quite nice place to relax for a short time.
+++Free WiFi++Very small, quaint, cute shopEgg salad sandwich with bacon on pumpernickel was good without being too eggyWife enjoyed egg on English muffinThat cappuccino bowl was F'ing HUGE. Its like 6 American cappuccinos, probably more. But, it's not as strong as American cappuccino. +Good coffeeAlthough we didn't order he price fixe brunche, it looked scrumptious, however it looked like A LOT of food...order only if your hungryDonut was good-For some reason, I expected more out of the orange juice
such a charming cafe. delicious sweet treats and yummy coffee. I love the decor and the little details - initials carved into the tables, crown moldings , beautiful pastries on display. it was so quiet in there you can sit in peace and quiet. neighborhood gem in the village
Lovely, bright café with a relaxed and friendly vibe. I stopped in for lunch and had an amazing sprouts salad, which was served with two slices of toasted homemade bread. I thought it tasted amazing, and 3/4 of the way through I saw the dressing hidden behind the bowl, added it, and the salad was even more amazing with the dressing. I branched out a bit and tried the lavender latté ... ce n'était pas à mon goût. Next time I'll stick with the standard kind. I was intrigued by the chocolate chai latté but it wasn't available dairy-free, so please try it for me and let me know how it is.Their baked goods looked delish but I had used up my budget on lunch & coffee. Another time.
Cute place. Fantastic bakery items. Very accommodating with English speaking customers. Highly recommend the brioche cinnamon rolls. They were amazing! We even got more to go for the next morning.
Very  trendy and cozy.  enjoyed  my Espresso in a very  relaxed way! Probably  not the ideal snack  place,  but if you are up for  a hot cup of coffee while watching the winter  outside,  the place is an ideal location.
Nice spacious café in the gay village, with the best coffee in Montreal, yummy pastries and décor with good taste. The atmosphere is relaxing and chill, music not too loud, and not as packed as many other popular cafés  in Montreal, perfect for those who would like to take an afternoon coffee break with a nice book and cake. Try the allongé if you are into strong coffee.
Friendly, fresh and nice atmosphere. The food is clearly made with care.
There are only a couple of decent joints near the CBC building on Rene-Levesque that I could recommend for a small bite in a pleasurable atmosphere. Thank goodness De Farine has arrived on the scene! The owner and chef has done a great job on maintaining a balance between friendly and efficient. Her innovative pastries are incredible: try the bacon and cheddar croissant, corn muffin, or matcha biscotti-like treat. Her sous-pastry chef puts love into every goodie she bakes. The smoothies are cray-cray (they accommodate for non-dairy too). The interior is visually unique to the Village too: minimal-baroque mixed with rustic, exposed wood. De Farine in a word? Charming!
I stopped in to pick up a few treats and stayed for a cappuccino and a brioche. The coffee was delicious, and the brioche (topped with icing and filled with raisins) was one of the best I have had. Though at first I was disappointed that it was a bit small, the taste was incredible. The ratios of bread to icing to raisins was perfect and I think the size was perfect, actually. The donuts looked delicious also, and next time I want to try one. Another patron was eating a salad which looked very good.I took home a small box of cookies to have with my afternoon tea, and they were all great. The earl grey cookies could have been a bit more flavorful. However, the taste of earl grey, or similar flavor profiles like lavender or rose, is also easy to overdue, and I would rather have too little flavor than too much. The other cookies I got were playfully decorated. I especially loved the chocolate 'bisous' cookies.I will definitely come back for a coffee and a snack. DFEF has a wonderful atmosphere - nicely decorated, clean, and quiet - and is great for getting some work done. I would consider purchasing one of their exquisite looking cakes, but perhaps only for a special occasion since they are a bit pricey. Still, you get what you pay for, and here you are definitely paying for high-quality foods that are expertly prepared.
Le meilleur sandwich au Saumon bio en ville!
I didn't get to stay but I did pick up a cake on the fly for a good friend of mine's birthday.  She's not much of a dessert person, but I do know that she enjoys a not-too-sweet slice once in a while. The service was great, I got some help picking out  a Coconut-Lemon Olive Oil Cake and found a cat cookie to place on top! (She's one of those cat people) I did notice how busy the cafe was, and wished to stay for a cup. They had these cute little cakes inside variety of cake stands.Side Note: I kinda love the business card, it's simple, and to the point, and not of typical size.Taste verdict: 8 of us enjoyed the cake a lot, and she shared the cat cookie with us, that for some reason tasted like berries to us! The cake was moist, not overpoweringly lemony, and most important not uber sweet! I can't wait to try the other products here.
Though I have only visited this cafe once briefly for a business meeting, even that quick coffee was a memorable experience. While munching on a piece of delicious passionfruit cake, all I could do was marvel at the beautiful woodwork detailing the restaurant. Handcrafted tables, sleek but warm design, and a state-of-the-art glass-encased kitchen to keep the cooking staff cool in the heat. Amazing! Friendly service packed full of charm.
I walked in after doing the night shift, it was 7am on a Thursday morning. An older guy was sitting in the back and one woman was working behind the counter. She greeted me with a smile as low music played through the speakers. I explained I was tired and hungry and I had never been there before. She gave me multiple suggestions till I settled on a waffle with fresh fruit, whipped cream and maple syrup. I ate quietly by myself while she served me. It was so good. The fruit was fresh and delicious, the waffle was made on the spot, the whipped cream was light and the syrup was local and delicious. Matté Latté was so good that I brought my girlfriend back the next afternoon. The place was packed both inside and out and we were served promptly. Prices are high but fair for the portions and quality you get.
Charming little cafe in NDG.Breakfast menu includes a a selection of waffles and crepes, baked goods, and "typical" breakfast items (e.g., bacon, eggs, toast, potatoes). We went around 10:30 on a weekday and they were also starting to put lunch items into the display case, including some amazing looking salads, wraps, and paninis. I was looking for something breakfast-y and sweet, so I ordered the Bananas Foster waffle and a latte.The waffle was perfectly cooked with a crisp exterior and a soft and chewy interior. It was topped with a mess of bananas, warm buttery brown sugar sauce, and vanilla ice cream that, although nothing special on its own, melted into the butter-brown sugar sauce to form a next level creation. Yum. My latte had a bit too much foam for my liking, but was otherwise very good.Service was friendly and casual. Prices were very reasonable. The decor was eclectic and inviting. I would definitely come back... Although I think I'd be torn between getting the bananas Foster again or to trying some of the other things on the menu =)
Yummmmmy !! Just had a wonderful crepe ... Banana Foster and a very good Tortilla soup and sandwich !Cosy atmosphere , very nice team !! Really appreciate the attention to detail !Stomachs are full... We are heading to the Pourquoi Pas Espresso Bar on Amherst.... We need an amazing latte to finish this meal !!
I love these guys! The place feels homey, the service is super friendly and the food is all home made and yummy. The only problem with coming here is that I never want to leave!
Walked in an checked out the menu full of waffles and crepesAlso eggs bacon yummy But I ordered a fresh baguette with butter A delicious cinnamon brioche And a macchiato All of this was amazing Couldn't wait for the next bite Get over here and enjoy
I've been there countless of times! The coffee is great, the staff is friendly, and most of all, the food is delicious!
Great affordable food.  No rush move along.  I was there for 4 hours and no hassle.
Found this great little cafe while looking for a different place in NDG - it was a fantastic little find.I had waffles with dulce de leche (the real stuff, not the sickly-sweet kind you sometimes get) while the gf had the banana foster waffles - both were outstanding. There was a bunch of other food on display that looking great, including legit-looking Argentinean empenadas (I'm going to go back just to try them).We had lattes, and the coffee was good (but not amazing). They were still better than most breakfast places in Montreal, so it's not actually a negative.The staff were really friendly. They offered to combine different things from the menu if we wanted, and gave suggestions when we asked, which was nice.They had a terrace-like setup of table and chairs out the front, taking great advantage of NDG's massive sidewalks - something I'll definitely be giving it a go on the warmer weekends.
Stopped in for a smoothie prepared with fresh fruits. Staff is friendly and they have a DVD exchange
A great place to get a monster (sized) cookie and a latte and sit outside to people-watch. I was so impressed with the friendliness and great service of this place that I wanted to write a glowing review -- but was delighted to see that many others have already done so. I liked how there are unique things to nosh on at this cafe -- empanadas and alfajores (which were both delicious) to name a few. Seeing that so many people also loved the service and food here gives me more confidence that our positive experience was not just a fluke, and I look forward to returning!
Stayed in Montreal in NDG area and went here for breakfast two days in a row. Had eggs and bacon the first day and they kindly refilled my coffee without having to ask. Second day I was hungover and one of the girls suggested a Mate Latte (a green tea concoction with honey) which was nice. Had the waffles on my second round and it was wonderful. Friends enjoyed their crepes.Good atmosphere, friendly staff and the owner Andrea has great taste in music. Really nice and family friendly place to chill.
A bit haphazard, with slow, inattentive service, but a friendly place that has good food.  Our "blueberry pancakes" came with no blueberries in the pancakes -- berries came in a little bowl.  Cook said she doesn't like to put berries in batter because they gum up the skillet. Pancakes were still tasty, but we'd have preferred to know what we'd get before it arrived. Our scrambled eggs and bacon were nicely cooked, with very good home fries.  The only coffee is dark-roast. If you prefer a lighter roast, you won't find it here.
The best! Beautiful people behind the counter, and lots of delicious items to choose from!!
I love this place. It is so down to earth, relaxed and the staff are very friendly. I really like that almost everything is made in house, from the muffins to the savory tarts. Their coffee works for me, and I consider myself quite picky. Overall, this place can only get better as they learn more and more of what works for their business!
We ordered the basic breakfast dish and the dolce de lece waffle. Basic breakfast was really good, the potatoes cooked to perfection. The dolce de lece and cream on my waffle was really good. For me, I prefer a little bit darker crunchier waffle. Still the cream and dolce de lece were delicious. What I think really makes this place nice is that you don't feel rushed out. It feels really nice to sip a giant latte and linger over the sun pouring in the front window. Great vibe and a really charming wait staff.
Great neighbourhood cafe, super friendly staff and delicious snacks! Only negative comment, needs some improvement on the wait time...
The alfajores are to die for but this café offers a great variety of treasures: Empanadas, torta tricolor, quiche, amazing and creative sandwiches, homemade cookies, cupcakes, etc. All healthy choices that looked fresh out of the kitchen. Everything  looked good and it was hard to choose! Thankfully,  I was served by Alvin, whom sense of humor is amazing and he was very helpful with his suggestions. The place seems to be family/friends run by people from the neighborhood. Definitely gives it a "home" feeling. Will definitely go back!
Not bad. I've had good and bad lattes here. Lots of room, outdoor terrace in the summer. I'd go back.
It's a charming beautiful place and the food is beautiful. Happy I found it as a spot for breakfast any day of the week.
Mate Latte is a great little cafe situated in ndg.  It has excellent food, great service and very friendly staff, I would highly recommend it to everyone!
This place was a great alternative to the greasy Cosmo's staple.  Much better breakfast that came with some white sauce that I can't quite identify, but put this from a 4 star to a 5 star.  Service was great!  Friendly, looks like it's family run, which is always entertaining.  A great change from the same old that most cafes seem to offer these days, lots of unique offerings.  I definitely plan on discovering more of them.
One of my favorite hidden treasures in Montreal! Such a great energy there! The place is family owned with friends helping so everyone is always so relaxed and happy which really rubs off on the patrons. The food is amazing, always fresh and different. Definitely try the Mate Latte, so good! Worth checking out and coming back. Thumbs way up, I havent found anything else like it.
Awesome service and and one of the only places I've found to get genuine Yerba Mate in MTL. Alvin was our server and gave the place a fantastic chill and laid back vibe. Will be sure to go back soon.
It's Sunday morning. Wake up, put pants on, and make your way to Hof. Guaranteed to be the best decision you'll make all day. I'm a regular at the Guillaume bakery a few blocks up, which is known for their French style breads. Hof, on the other hand, specializes more in Jewish style baked goods. Both are equally fantastic, just depends on your mood. But seriously, everything here is wonderful. Disclaimer I've never tried the in-house brunch (and have heard mixed reviews), but have had my weight in breads, cookies, babka, strudels, you name it. And oh my, this place is good. They also serve up a mad latte here. So grab some raisin bread and bialys and start the day right. Note: it's pricey, but yes it's worth every penny.
Hof Kelsten is owned by Jeffrey Finkelstein, who is known in Montreal as the 'bread guy.'  He supplies all the top restaurants with his various bread, and his creds include working at Toque!, French laundry, Per Se, and El Bulli.  His menu is strictly chef-driven, and offers items such as challah, ciabatta, baugettes, croissants, and also hot/cold beverages.  The hubs and I came here to try out some of their croissants - a regular croissant, a croissant sesame and amande, and a poppy seeded croissant with cheese - the croissants were all pretty okay, but I liked the croissant with the poppy seed and the cheese, as it had a nice little goat-cheese-esque hint to it with plenty of poppyseeds.   These were also pretty good when warmed in the microwave the next day for a quick morning snack!  I also saw a colorful special drink beverage, so I tried the Arnie P (can't pass up on an Arnold Palmer!) - this was super refreshing, a slight tartness, and yummy - I highly recommend!  The staff here are super friendly, and there are plenty of seats - the place is more modern and open, and I was surprised, as I thought it would be more of a hole-in-the-wall, industrial bakery place!  Lots of patrons coming in to get breads to go.+run by Jeffrey Finkelstein, the 'bread guy'+fresh croissants+Arnie P drink :D+friendly staff+cash on Canadian debit only!
GREAT FOOD, QUESTIONABLE SERVICEThe bakery is in a prime location on St Laurent Blvd. By recommendation, I decided to go with the GRAVLAX, a bold smoked salmon sandwich. It is definitely one of the BEST form of smoked salmon i have had. Strong smoked salmon with a layer of lettuce and tomato on soft wheat bread generously coated with cream cheese. The combination was perfect and the sandwich was truly delicious. Being a popular in travel magazines, I would assume that people visiting Montreal would want to try the place out. They are not an exclusive cash only place, but they have some strange issues going on with electronic payment (international debit cards). I was told by the staff that they do not accept credit cards (debit only) and they also do not accept international debit cards (USA). They do not accept payment in US dollars (conversion) and was pretty much only left with an option to pay by cash. Displaying specific instructions on acceptable modes of payment would be helpful. Even after withdrawing cash, there was some confusion among the staff to take payment before or after service. This confusion caused delay in service and sort of left me waiting in line while the food had already been prepared.
This is the bakery that serves all the best restaurants and bars in the city. Some great standards in terms of bread. I have had many from the baguette to Rye and many others and they are all great. That is why it has been rated one of the city's best. I haven't eaten any sandwiches yet but look for an updated review when I do. ONE IMPORTANT thing, this is the only place in Montréal that I know of the serves Biolys. Biolys are a New York specialty that are amazing....bagel like bread with an onion centre. I love it! Worth a try. Only a half dozen made each day.
Hof has a little something I can't quite put my finger on that makes you feel happy to be there.The bread here is to DIE for! You MUST try a ricotta + poppy seed twisty bread thingy (yes, it's an order). The coffee is good too and so are the pastries.
Fantastic small minimalist bakery with no name on the outside so you could clearly walk by. What I love about HK is the baked products are seriously some of the best in MTL. I've sampled the chocolate babka pain perdu (glazed with caramel) and also I took a sourdough bread home. The sourdough is the closest thing to SF sourdough that you can get to. Then also we brought back some scones which were buttery, flaky and delicious. One small dissapointment was the cappuccino. I believe it to be some small house indie roasted coffee but I thought mine to be a bit cold and not very strong. Beware not many places to sit and they fill up fast. My next visit will be a whole chocolate babka and possibly some challah bread. Delicious stuff folks. If you are a carb king then this is your royal palace! Check it out!
I've been looking forward to try this place for brunch for a while as I had heard good things about it.  To be fair,  my rating should be 3,5.  What I liked most and deserves 4 stars was the food.  I ordered the pain doré brunch plate.  The pain doré itself ranks in the best pain dores I have tried.  The fact that it's made out of homemade thick slices of bread and pure maple syrup makes it just excellent.  It also comes with a side of back bacon tasty as they season it. Also had a side of Kale which was fresh and generous.What made me note it down to a 3.5 star is the setting which is very basic and the fact that you don't have a sit down service.  I enjoy cozy and we'll thought out decors and although the small plants are cute, the setting lacks a bit of warmth and comfort especially since you don't get table service as this means a lot of people getting up to get their plates from the counter.  The good news is that both decor and table service can be added and updated to go with the deliciousness  of their pastries and brunch plates. Overall, I enjoyed my brunch very much as it was tasty but might take my brunch to go next time.
I really enjoyed the rugelach here, but the service left much to be desired. I came here because I wanted to try the challah bread, but I didn't realize they only served it on Fridays. I asked the staff just to confirm, because the menu was in French, and she was unfriendly and a bit standoffish when I asked her for recommendationsStill, would probably come back to try the bread, but I just wish the service was friendlier
after a year of sampling the shit out of Hof and doing my little taste test, i'm upgrading my rating for this awesome jewish bakery that, imo, redefined the game on many things.yes, it can be pricey and yes, some of the goods are misses but damn, angels sing whenever i'm there.the hof is a bakery that provides tables and chairs if you want to sit down to eat which is nice if you want to relax a bit. alongside baked goods, breads and brunch, you have coffee from parlor coffee, a roaster from brooklyn new york.the coffee, for me, is on point. not the best in town but still a good damn cup of joe and strong like i like them.and finally, every time i go there, i get this huge craving and the only prescription is more challah or babka so i try not to go too often. its seriously fattening.now, excuse me while i go lick the pictures of the goods i took
I had brunch here with two friends. It's very busy on weekend mornings. I got a sandwich, which was delicious. And i also got a pistachio croissant as a treat, which was also so good! My friends got the french toast and a salmon dish, and they really enjoyed it. I like the retro style of the bakery. They also have many other desserts and breads that you can take to go.
Hof Kelstein ranks #1 on my list of amazing Hofs, surpassing both David Hasselhoff and Germany's Hofbrauhaus. Why? Because unlike the latter, it makes me feel good about life. I mean, seriously... how could you eat one of their bursting-at-the-seam-with-cheese breakfast sandwiches and not have an optimistic outlook on life? And with latkes reminiscent of Channukah dinners or breads so fluffy you could use them as pillows, this is really all you need to be happy.
Hof Kelsten may not say much from the outside, since the store doesn't have any signs. Yet, their breads, pastries, and brunches speak for themselves. Who needs a sign, when you're that well known!The decor on the inside is unique, you may think it's under construction, but in reality.. It's not. You step into a world of amazing & fantastic quality breads and pastries, which are also available at some of the top restaurants in Montreal. Jeffrey(The owner) who makes you smile at all times, is one very talented, hard working, and great person. Once you met him, you understand why his pastries taste so well, he puts 100% dedication into them, with the finest & European ingredients. Now onto the staff, when I walked into the store, the greeted me so nicely, five minutes later I walked out with a box full of pastries, and a loaf of bread. The staff was kind enough to hand it to me, and open the door, also asked if I needed any help. All this being said, it left a warm, comforting feeling of wanting to come back again and again. Who needs an expensive French patisserie when you have a warm and comforting Hof Kelsten!
I posted a photo of the VLT sandwich. At $9 a pop, I definitely won't be going back. Nice service, though that doesn't make up for it.
It's a very ... pretty space. It's modern and makes you feel like you're about to experience something wonderful. I was very excited to go based on the reviews here, so I finally went one day and decided to try the ricotta and poppyseed bread twist. It was very dry, not particularly flavorful, just not good. I took one bite and if it weren't for the fact that I was really hungry, would have thrown it away. It was that bad. I might give Hof Kelsten a second chance (that strawberry rugelach looked so good, but then again, so did the ricotta bread thing) but not super excited to.
I've been here a few times since it first opened. Amazing bakery. The croissant is buttery but so fluffy. I've had the chicken club sandwich with veal bacon and a side of potato salad. It was light and very tasty. For brunch, I've had the challah french toast with pancetta and egg. Amazing the syrup brings all of the items together. It's a must try. I've also had the schnitzel. Lightly breaded topped off with a green salsa eggs and potatoes. The shakshuka is also one of my favorites. Tomato with mergez sausages with eggs comes also with piece of toast. The house lemonade is very sweet and sour. Downside is there isn't a lot of sitting area so you might have to wait a few minutes but every time I've gone I've maybe waited 10mins. So order your food by the time they call you seats would have opened up.
Challah makes me hollaaaaaaaa. Babka makes me wanna adopt a new religion. Hallelujah! Singing high praises for a bakery that brings us loaves of rye, semolina, whole wheat, white, baguette and all kind of carby  goodness that are kneaded with know how & made with whole ingredients. Sandwiches are some of the best in the city that go beyond a 'like' to enter the territory of love. As for the brunch - haven't been but I'd be down to try it. Amen.
Great latte. I enjoyed the danish I had, but until I have another pastry that leaves a better impression this place gets a 4.
First timer on a brunchy Sunday, and although I am not ecstatic about the Hof (yet), there are some great things to mention: atmosphere was very nice and the service prompt and friendly (thus, review should be 3.5 stars). Had the schnitzel brunch special with hash browns and 2 eggs that came with a green sauerkraut-sauce and sliced bread. For the price I definitely thought I got stuffed. Tastewise however it wasn't crazy special, rather on the bland side. The intriguing sounding sauerkraut-sauce was not really sauerkraut-y..?! Their coffee was good, strong and straightforward. Best thing about this sampling was their breadpudding thingy... The baguette's nice and crispy, but personally I prefer the one from their competition further up on the main... Nevertheless, I will go back for more coffee and try their pastries, croissants, challah and other breads for sure...
The best croissant anywhere in the world. The croissant has a little twang that is intriguing and delicious. The baker used to work with Ferran Adria and his training is definitely put to use make delicious baked goods and sandwiches.
I love the decor here!!! Raw/simple/wild/nice.They have good bakeries and coffee, come and enjoy your afternoon.
Came here to pick up some pastries for the office today and WOW, so freaking good. I got an assortment of the rugelach, danishes and a gorgeous looking loaf of challah that I saw being pulled from the oven. Everything is so amazing, as dense as it should be and not too heavy on the fillings and this is hands down, some of THE best challah that I have ever had (am loving the poppy seed and sesame seed mix.) I am a huge fan now and the staff kept me entertained while I waited for my challah to come out of the oven. I will definitely be a regular here!! The latte was also most excellent.
Location: On the Main. Street parking only.The place: I was actually surprised at Hof's size. For some reason, I'd expected the storefront to be teeny tiny. The shop is fairly airy and there's a decent seating area as well. The goods: Fresh bread, cookies and a few pastries. In terms of the bread, they offer a few varieties, such as Pumpernickel, sunflower seed, baguettes, Ciabatta etc. While I did eyeball the Pumpernickel, I decided to go for the Ciabatta because I had big plans to pick up some Italian salami at the market and what goes better with salami than CIabatta? Nothing, that's what. And, as luck would have it, the nice boy behind the counter sliced my bread for me. Score.  As far as the bread goes, you can't possibly get any fresher than this. Typically, Ciabatta is heavy and somewhat dense, not to mention chewy. My loaf? Light and airy and SO fluffy I could have used it as a pillow. In terms of consistency, it had a bit of chew to it and it was perfect. Service: The fellow who served me was awesome and super friendly. He took the time to explain the bread's 'make-up' and how to best preserve it if I wasn't going to eat it all in the same week. However, the chick at the counter, while (eventually) friendly, made me wait 5+ minutes while she flirted with the customer in front of me. I can appreciate the need to talk to cute boys and all that, but do it on your own time. Price point: On par with most bakeries. I think my loaf was $4 , but it was a pretty good size so you'll hear no complaints from me.
I have been dying to try German bakery Hof Kelsten for lunch after my mother brought their panettone to Christmas dinner. It was moist, delicious and certainly special, the best I have ever tasted. But, quite pricey. I went in this week for a sandwich and coffee. The VLT was fatty, chewy veal pancetta between two measly slices of white toasted bread for 8$ plus tax. The coffee was mediocre. The woman who served me was bitter and unsmiling, and rushed me to order. The decor has that unfinished or under-construction look to it which I don't get. I don't care if you are trendy, Hof Kelsten, but you gotta work on your sandwiches and your staff, you've left me disappointed and hungry. I will come back for pastries and update this review then.
Am I blessed or cursed to have two excellent bakeries in mere walking distance from me? With Guillaume just north on Laurier and Hof on Mont Royal, its a carbo-philes dilemna on St Laurent these days!My early review of Guillaume had that as my fave baguette place. Hof Kelsten is competing very closely for that spot. Its a dead heat at this point which baguette I prefer.One advantage Hof Kelsten has is their cafe latte's are great. Totally unexpected for a bakery! They do desserts too, which are on my to eat list, and have weekend brunch.So my preferred baguette genre - Hard crust which is crunchy and moist bread, 80% hydration. Lather it up with butter and nom nom nom!
Love the bread, but must admit to being underwhelmed by the brunch. The salmon was tasty but the latkes lacked crunch and flavour, and the staff were weirdly strictly against cooking the eggs in the way our friends from our of town requested (all eggs must be runny? I can't help but feel confused by this.) I think too the paper plate idea doesn't work so well with runny eggs, and it increased the feeling of paying too much ($17) for not quite enough.
I wanted to buy a perfect to make french toast.  Then I googled and found that Challah bread will be very good to make one.  So I went there.  It is surprising big.  I took the classic one, $6.5.   Taste quite rich and good since there are a lot of egg and butter in it, but easily gets dry I think.  That's why it's perfect for french toast I guess.  Their other baked stuffs look good,too.  But after bought the big Challah, I think I will go back to try their other things later. :)
Fantastic.  Croissants are perfect. The bread is beautiful. Wanted to buy loads of it to take home. Sampled quite a few pastries and everything was very good.  Decor tres hip - very nice.  Friendly service.  Very clean.  Well worth the visit.  Recommended.
I finally popped in to Hof Kelsten to try out how they matched up to Guillaume.  I was happy enough to see that the folks at HK aren't merely copying what Guillaume is doing en anglais.  Aside from the utilitarian vibe (cement floors, unpainted/unfinished wood walls, etc.) the two are apples and oranges.I ordered a special club sandwich which was an interesting twist on the classic club: some sort of herb-infused oil (I'm guessing tarragon, there was no explanation) and whole seeds of coriander which, while giving a nice burst of coriander flavour, weren't exactly pleasant to chow into.  There are these rad things called spice mills that could easily remedy that.My wife got a chicken salad sandwich which was nothing necessarily special to write home about.  Hof Kelsten chicken salad = chicken salad.Lastly, the bread.  I'm crazy about bread and that was easily the best part of the meal.  It would make sense that the bread is the specialty here, because it was the most redeeming part of the sandwich, but at 10$ a sandwich, I'd rather just grab a loaf and make a sandwich at home.We happened to come in around 13h on a Saturday, and were the first in line yet from order to reception of food, the whole process took around 15 minutes.  I've worked in plenty of delis and restaurants that make sandwiches and unless the kitchen staff happened to be on break as soon as we ordered, this is a long time to wait for a couple of sandwiches.  For a deli, this is pretty sad.All in all, unfriendly service, long wait, and overpriced fare.  No thanks, I'll go to Guillaume or make sandwiches at home.  If anything was organic or warranted the costs, it'd be a deal.  Knowing how cheap the ingredients must've been, I won't be back.
Over the past few months, I had heard plenty about a bakery right on the edge of Mile End. A place started by a chef who, turns out, sells bread to many of the best restaurants in the city - Joe Beef, Toqué! and Nora Gray to name a few - something that I had never known and that completely blew my mind. The fact that all of these places look to Chef Jeff Finklestein for bread speaks volume about the quality of his product. His new bakery Hof Kelsten now allows us common folk to get a fresh loaf for ourselves.Hof Kelsten is located just off the corner of Saint-Laurent and Mont Royal in what I recalled being an old super club Videotron which was confirmed when I noticed that the overnight return slot in still present with the sticker above it. There is no sign outside and the interior is relatively sparse - unfinished wood counters, a white tile wall, concrete floor and a few spot to sit down. The only indication of the name is the green fluorescent lights shaped into Hof Kelsten above the counter. Behind the bread wall, you can see the large kitchen where all the work is done.Hof Kelsten offers a variety of bread and pastries with a few weekly specials such as Challah only available on Fridays. For my initial visit, I went with a loaf of their sourdough. Now I love sourdough bread - it is pretty much the only bread I eat when in the States as it is readily available there. I have never been able to find good sourdough to bring home here until now. This bread was great - beautiful crust, great flavour and perfect texture. I finally have sourdough bread in Montreal. Thank the heavens!For the bread alone, I will be coming back quite often from here on out but there is even more. They also have a sandwich menu and a number of other items with a strong Jewish influence. Grabbing lunch, I went with the brisket sandwich with a half portion of Matzo ball soup and some latkes. The brisket is served warm with sliced apples, red cabbage and beet slaw with what appeared to be a homemade thousand island dressing all on the house rye. Just a wonderful sandwich. I never would have thought of apples and thousand island dressing with brisket but the combination works extremely well.The Matzo soup was wonderful as well - great depth of flavour in the stock (and surprisingly not as salty as I expected), generous amount of chicken and vegetables in the soup and the matzo balls themselves were great. A perfect addition on a cold December as it was.The last item was the latkes - quite large individually. Great crust on them while maintaining a nice texture inside. The surprising plus was the dipping sauce - a nice sweet addition that offset the lack of actual apple sauce to use instead (Note that I've always been a apple sauce over sour cream guy).All in all, Hof Kelsten is a great bakery that lived up to all the praise I've heard and then some. The fact that I am only a quick bike or drive (or longish walk) away means that I have found my new "neighbourhood" bakery. Getting restaurant caliber bread on a weekly basis will be a beautiful thing and something that everyone near and far should run over for as quickly as they can.Cheers!
Soooo. Good. We had brunch there (challah French toast was amazing) and ordered bread to go. Everything was made to perfection, and the service was just lovely. Highly recommended.
The baguettes and loaves are very good to excellent, although I prefer Boulangerie Guillaume's. The breakfast sandwich - white toast, American cheese, and a yolky fried egg on top - is simple and satisfying. At the moment, they are serving great coffee as part of a collaboration with Dispatch Coffee. The latte was very good -- better than Melbourne's across the street, and certainly at par with what the Dispatch truck served up this summer.
I was excited to learn that a new bakery had opened in the space previously occupied by the Superclub Videotron, on Saint-Laurent just north of Mont-Royal.  Designed by super designer Zebulon Perron, the shop itself doesn't give off a bakery vibe when passing by, and it actually took a friend to point out that it was indeed a bakery for me to take notice.  Instead from the outside it looked more like an industrial half finished space to me, reminiscent of hospital food prep areas.  But once I took the time to stop in (rather than just driving or biking by the big floor to ceiling windows), I realized that it really worked once inside.    The counter is long and there are all kinds of breads stacked behind it, and sweets tucked into the display case. There's a looooooong table at which to perch and nibble on goodies.  And those floor to ceiling windows are GREAT for people watching.  I especially liked the fact that they kept the after hours delivery box in the doorway, just in case people forgot the space's old vocation.But was it good?  It was!  So far I've only tried a chocolate danish and a loaf of ciabatta, but I'll be back for sure!  I'm especially excited to go back on a Friday when they make challah bread, a delicious egg bread.  They also make sandwiches at lunch, and I can see myself popping in for a quick bite during summer Fridays, when I'm too lazy to make my own sandwich, or perhaps not so inspired to stock my kitchen with goodies.  The chocolate danish I had was more of a chocolate cinnamon bun than what I would consider a danish . . . and that's a good thing.  The dough was rich but not too heavy, chocolately but not too gooey.  Very very delicious, for someone who takes her baked goods seriously.
This bakery is a must if you're in the busy area of the Plateau. There is a variety of choices to please everybody! Sanwiches, baked goods, coffee, breads etc. It's a great place to go during a lazy Sunday afternoon. The atmosphere is great and you can just relax and unwind. The owner is very dedicated to his buisness so the the food is always consistenly tasy and well served.
Great bakery. Love the raisin challah on Fridays and the chocolate babka. Hands down best challah and babka in Montreal.
Hof Kelsten is the latest addition to Mile End's boulangerie scene, and it instantly became recognized as a city-wide contender.  Baker/owner Jeffrey Finkelstein built up a reputation supplying many of Montreal's top restaurants with their bread before opening up to the public.  The approach leans towards Central Europe (caraway rye, rugelach, babka, etc.), but Hof Kelsten bakes some French loaves too (including my favourite Montreal baguette at the moment).  They also serve meals (lunch, brunch), but so far I've stuck to the baked goods.  The pastries are generally good, and they're definitely refreshingly different from the kind of fare one tends to find in Montreal's bakery scene, but I've encountered problems with undercooked items from time to time, so now I just focus on their bread.
The babka are heaven ! it's like drug ! you have to try.Coffee amazing, the brisket sandwich is heaven so is the chopped liver one too.Really a place to go again, again and again.Really a nice addition the area.
The menu is simple and everything looks delicious. I had the breakfast sandwich + regulach + latte + pumpernickel bread. All very good! The bad thing is that they serve everything in paper plates and plastic containers :( I would go back because their bread worth it!
Outstanding baked goods. The owner, Jeff, is a great guy and a master at what he does. Stop by for coffee, breakfast, or to pick up a loaf of bread to go. This place is world class.
Wow! Now you're talking about awesome taste! The best flavors ever found in a sandwich. The bread is delicate and tasty. The smoked salmon and beef were amazing, leveraged by very inventive tasty dressings. The service is very friendly. The place is rather cramped, but perfect for a quick bite. Both take out bread and deserts are worth the detour!
My young daughter and I went for lunch this weekend and we both loved it! Gravlax sandwich on rye was delicious. Great matzo ball soup (deep, rich colored broth). Chocolate danoise was amazing. The latke wasn't actually my favorite type of latke, however. I prefer a crunchier latke through and through, but I did love the dipping sauce. Oh, and the espresso? Fantastic. They have a great barista.
Just an outstanding place- they do only a few things, but do them extremely well. The cookies, rugelah, and Danishes are among the best in the city. The coffee as well is great- very rich and full flavoured. A nice repurposed space that used to be a video rental store.
Amazing bread, really great bread. A little pricey, but hey... it's worth it.
If you're looking for lunch downtown then no worries because your search is over.Order anything on the menu and be delighted be the freshness of the food. They always have one vegetarian soup of the day which warms my heart to no end. Their quiches are creamy yet light and their sandwiches are the perfect thing to grab and go when you're short on time. If you're feeling indulgent and want to treat yourself - you can't go wrong with their lemon tart or their almond croissant. Hope you enjoy them as much as I do!
Wonderful spot for grab-and-go sandwiches or delicious chocolate bread! The chocolatine is good and only $2. Their almond croissant is very good, not as moist as Mamie Clafoutis, but the crispy cookie top is yummy! Service is great.They also have cakes and other sweets, they look nice but also like they sat there for a while.Unfortunately the sandwiches are usually gone on the weekend. Nothing is left!!For weekday lunch and sometimes dinner, the sandwiches are good. There is seating upstairs for people watching. It's lovely in the winter storms where we watch 3 trucks fight their way through the little Peel street.
Great place to get pastries and sandwiches. The place is small and quaint. I love their hot chocolate on a cold day with a fruit tart. It's also great if you sit upstairs and people watch.
This is the best patisserie I've been to so far. The almond croissant is something you definitely should get there, it's extremely delicious. The price is also very reasonable. One croissant is around 3.5$ (tax included) and it is pretty filling. On the second floor of the patisserie is a relaxing, clean cafe, where you can enjoy the greatness of the pastries and sweets, along with a nice cup of coffee.
Beast bread local chain (or boutique if you want to get fancy) ever! Ok, maybe I'm biased. We usually stay in the neighborhood of the one near Sherbrooke and this always has a spot on our itinerary. They offer pastries, croissant, bread, coffee and sandwiches. I'm sure there's better but you can't beat the proximity and convenience of their hours (except Sunday's- closed!!)We usually stop in at some point during the day to pick up almond croissants, chocolate almond croissants and a coffee. All relatively reasonably priced and delicious. I'm always wary of sandwiches at bakeries, however, their sandwiches come pressed and are quite tasty. They offer free wifi and a seating area upstairs. Service is quick if you're just picking up bread or pastries, however, there can be a bit of a wait for sandwiches and lattes.
To be honest the Parisian style Macaroons, while good, were not great, and were certainly surpassed by their Almond and "plain" (classic butter) Croissants in quality. And those Croissants were DELICIOUS! great flaky textures and the Almond was the best ever. My recommendation is to buy at least two so that you will have one for later because they too good to postpone the enjoyment of eating one immediately.Service is friendly and efficient, prices are reasonable.
Pastry, pastry, my world for a pastry.I salivate whenever I walk by any bakery - I can never say 'no' to carbs. But take my advice and say 'no' to the chocolatines (chocolate croissants) here - I always hope they taste better than they look, but every time I've eaten one, they're dry/overbaked, with very little chocolate inside. On the other hand, you cannot go wrong with the baguettes, plain croissants, almond croissants, and almond-chocolate croissants. These are DIVINELY flakely, buttery, and melt-in-your-mouth. I've tried some fruit tarts and small chocolate cakes and they've been good too, but nothing has compared to the croissants and baguettes. Drool.
Love love love this place! Great selection and lines move fast. The sandwiches are amazing I always get one when I am in Montreal! I love the multi grain croissant with the ham or turkey both are great and it never lets me down!
fruit tarts!!!!that's the only reason i go here as i haven't really found the perfect fruit tarts. there's a pain doré in JTM but they don't have fruit tarts and première moisson doesn't satisfy me. that's why when i'm craving some tarts, this is the one i hit. there's something about fresh fruits, a barely sweet custard and the flaky shell. not soggy like other places and not rock hard break a tooth fuck i should sue you either. nothing of sort, just a flaky tart shell that breaks with a bit of pressure.have to say i'm not a fan of anything else though but the fruit tart, i can't get enough of that!
This is an adorable little place to grab a quick breakfast. I had the grilled baguette with butter and raspberry jam, and a cappuccino. My Sweetheart had the Sicilian Panini with coffee and we split a pan au chocolat. Everything was delicious and fresh and the service was charming!
Neat little sandwich shop and bakery in the McGill/downtown area.  I stopped in and got a turkey baguette sandwich (thin-sliced turkey, greens, and what I think was a thin layer of dijon)...nothing elaborate, but really delicious, mostly due to the freshness of the bread.  I also decided to try the pain au chocolat, which was good but didn't taste quite as fresh as the baguette.  In any case the whole thing came to a very reasonable price (around $10), so it was a satisfactory lunch.  They have a small seating area on the second floor, upstairs from the counter and register.  A good option for small parties looking to grab some quick, inexpensive, French cafe food.  The employees were friendly and the shop is bright and sunny.
They have the best creme brulee. They toast the top right in front of you and they are always friendly. Only bad thing is that they run out so darn quickly. Their lemon tarts are nice as well, more tart than sweet.
My friend says I have a regular stomach for meals, a stomach for desserts, and finally a stomach for bread. Pain Doré was right up my alley for satisfying all my carb needs. I remember walking by this place all the time during my first year in Montreal. It wasn't until one day when I decided to have a picnic that I finally paid this place a visit. I have tried their olive bread, raisin and nut bread, brioche, but somehow I always revert back to their classic old baguette. I think if I could only eat one thing for the rest of my life, it would probably be a baguette. Personally I haven't tried their pastries but that's because I have more of a "bread" tooth and a sweet tooth. Regardless, their pastry selection looks pretty damn awesome.They have a sister store called Brioche Dorée at St. Laurent and Prince Arthur. The selection of bread there is definitely not as diverse as the ones they have at Pain Doré. If you're a bread fanatic, this location is probably better suited for your carb needs. Keep in mind if you go during lunch hours, this place could get pretty jam packed with a line that extends out the door.  P.S. I just found out this place actually has two floors with a little café upstairs. Will probably go up there someday, enjoy a coffee, try out some pastries, and do some people watching.
A delightful little bakery with fresh breads, croissants and more. I love bakeries, so already having bought lunch, I had to check this place out.The cranberry bread had plenty of cranberries and a good chewy texture.  The olive bread was also good.  If I am back in Montreal, I would love to try some other baked goods here.
The prime location and mighty fine pastries keep customers coming back for more. Au Pain Doré is a Montreal bakery that has been in business for over 50 years, pretty sure it's not this location though. They have successfully spread across Montreal with a focus on traditional French tastes using artisanal baking techniques and quality ingredients.This particular location is actually two floors.  The ground floor is the busy section with customers coming and going while the baked goods fly off the shelves. Counters line the walls selling breads, pastries, and other baked goods.  The second floor is jam packed with tables and chairs and a small deli counter.Normally I don't head downtown for a loaf of bread, but their selection of loaves and baguettes get my mouth watering every time.  Usually I stop by for the pastries.  I just tried their superb cherry danish.  A light flaky pastry covered in a perfect glaze and topped with cherry filling. I'll be back for another one soon.  They build some pretty nice sandwiches too. Built on their fresh baked bread and packed full with full fresh ingredients they absolutely destroy Subway.Stuff is a little more expensive than Tim Horton's but is pretty similar to what you would pay at Starbucks.  The staff have always been helpful even when we aren't speaking the same language. It's a perfect spot to grab a treat if you happen to be downtown.
the confidence was the best! I think it's one of their most famous dessert and it's definitely worth the hype. It looks like a giant macaron, but I think it tastes much better. It's crispy and chewy and  has an awesome filling. The chocolate raspberry one is a must try! There's a little cafe upstairs where you can enjoy their baked goods as well as a cup of hot coffee. :)
This place has been my one of my go to spots ever since my first visit to Montreal. This spot is located on the main hub of activity and serves as a great alternate to bring something to your hotel room or a very good snack for your trip. I really like their baked good especially the croissants and palmiers. This trip was no exception I grabbed a Turkey sandwich for the trip back (on a croissant of course :) and a apricot and cheese danish for dessert. the dessert are the right amount of sweet and hit the spot for me.  People seated next to me on the trip back were envious and I ate till my heart was content. If you are leaving from downtown for your trip back this is a great option (other being the atwater location as the highway exit quite close)
After strolling the nearby McGill campus, my kid and I were hungry for lunch, so we popped in here for a light bite. I ordered a sandwich with goat cheese and veggies: I forget the name, but it was quite good (if not a tad plain), along with an iced coffee. My kid ordered a croissant. We went upstairs to eat, and the gal behind the counter upstairs prepared my coffee drink (which was excellent). The best thing we ordered was the croissant. It was superb. Extremely fresh and light and flaky and buttery (but not in a greasy way). Makes me want to go back and try their other bakery goods.It was nice to go upstairs and sit along the window and watch the hustle and bustle and the people of the city below.
Booyah!!!  This patisserie in the middle of downtown was one of the highlights of my trip to Montreal. Nothing beats authentic homemade french breads and desserts. I loved it so much, I made two trips in two days. I had a chocolate eclair, chocolate muffin and a mini croissant. My mom had fruit tarte, lemon tarte, almond croissant and tarte aux fine pomme. DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They also have breads, quiche, sandwiches, coffee and other amazing pastries.  The service is fast and friendly. C'est excellente!!
4.8... can always be better but clearly my favourite croissants in Montreal so far!buttery, tasty, fluffy... almost perfect!!!PS: I didn't try anything else there (nothing looks really appealing to me... perhaps just a personal feeling because of the display of boulangerie and salads and macarons so close to each other)
Just past St.Catherine on the east side on Peel. Little shop, with displays full of tasty treats. Not for those on a budget,  but a splurge worthy treat for your taste buds.
Nice and cozy place to buy sandwiches, pastries and cakes downtown Montreal. I really enjoy the fact that there's some decent space upstairs to sit and watch the traffic on Peel. I had a kale salad (delicious - one of the best I had in my life!!!) and a croissant. Unfortunately, there is not a lot of vegetarian choices... but so much good-looking delicacies to try!!!! It's obviously must-return ;)
A very good bakery with friendly service. I liked the chocolate croissant which had the right amount of chocolate and flakiness. Also had the chocolate twist that the server recommended, but it was a bit weird. The texture of the filling was a bit too slimey.I would come back for pastries for breakfast.
We ate here 3 times for breakfast last week instead of paying $30 per person at our hotel. The baked goods are so fresh, rich and delicious. We ordered chocolatine, almond chocolatine, blueberry Danish, pear and apple Danish, filtered coffee, green tea and chocolate milk (for the kids). Upstairs had lots of seating and free Wifi. There's a Starbucks across the street but we decided to take advantage of this local bakery. Much more variety of baked goods. Note: If you order coffee or tea, you can pay for everything downstairs, then bring the receipt to obtain your drink from the barista upstairs.
By far the most delicious almond croissant I ever had. Crispy on the outside, soft and tasty almond filling in the inside. So good, you won't regret it! Also tried their chocolate almond croissant, it's taste even better, but you need to go early for that, those sell out quickly. Their macaroons are lovely too, not overly sweet but packed with great flavour
I come here everytime I'm in Montreal...usually, to get 5-6 sandwiches/pastries for the long-ass drive home.Its unpretentious, relatively inexpensive, no wait, clean, near many of the main attractions.Hit it once...you'll be a fan.
I was walking up Rue Peel looking for a place suggested to me by a friend.  Suddenly, a smokin hot chick rossed my path and went into this place.  I thought for a moment, 'maybe smokin hot chick knows a really good place for breakfast. Maybe smokin hot chick and I can strike up a meaningful conversation, fall madly in love with each other, and be together forever?'     Not wanting to tempt fate and avoid ruining the happy delusion my brain had concocted, I entered. I asked the girl behind the counter about breakfast.  She told me I had to go upstairs.  Meanwhile, smokin hot chick quickly got a coffee and quickly walked out. My happy delusion crushed, I slowly walked up the stairs of solitude and inquired about breakfast again to the lady behind that counter.  She explained the specials, and I ordered it.  A croissant with ham and cheese and vegetables, a side of something and a beverage.  (I went with coffee and bowl of fruit.) Total was ten and change. The fruit was obviously canned, the croissant was cold Despite being squashed in a panini press.  The coffee was pretty good. AND I wasn't gonna live happily ever after with hot chick.      It was just an ok meal. I didn't however try their bread, which looked very good. So that might redeem it if you go.
This is a regular haunt for me & my family. While my favorite is the Brioche Au Sucre it  is far from all I enjoy there.With my sweet tooth I favor the sweet treats. Mom loves the Lemon tart, but like me will also enjoy the almond croissant and other danishes or tarts.I love to go when it is really quiet then I can get a seat upstairs and people watch.
hubby + i had been staying at a b&b which served up wonderful rustic bread from here. at first, we didn't think much of frozen bread, but once we tried it, it was clear this was a winner and we had to take it home!!before our flight, we stopped by rue peel street to this 2 story bakery + cafe. you can order things upstairs, too! by 5pm, most items were sold out, but right at the entrance were their delicious MINI RUSTIC BREADS .. frozen. :) we grabbed 2 bags (comes in package of 10) along with two express sandwiches (aka TO GO).the parisian and chicken sandwich were good and very filling. it's perfect for on the go. however, the real winner was still the frozen breads. we got back to the states ... baked them in the oven (3-4 minutes only)!!! and viola, that beauuutiful delicious bread... spread some cheese on it and oh, heaven!
As far as I'm concerned, Au Pain Doré gets five stars. I noticed this bakery at night and made a mental note to return for breakfast fare at 7am when its doors would open.The plan was to get seven croissants -- one for each person in our traveling group. When I saw the pains aux chocolat and the pains aux raisins (called "chocolatines" and "roulés aux raisins" in Canada), I asked for one of each because I was curious. As the employee prepared to grab a chocolatine, I noticed that they had mini versions of their baked goods! At a discounted price for six items purchased, too!I walked out with seven regular-sized croissants, seven mini chocolatines, and seven mini roulés aux raisins. As per my request they were all divided into several bags, which all fit into a five-cent plastic bag. The service was friendly and the prices were reasonable; I was pleased, to say the least.Back at the hotel, we sampled the goods. The croissants were soft and flaky with a subdued buttery taste. I prefer my croissants with a bit more flavor, but the texture was so wonderful and I was so pleasantly surprised that it suited me perfectly. I ate it so fast that I didn't have the time to think about taking a picture!Naturally I couldn't wait to taste the adorable mini chocolatine; this time I took a picture! It was every bit as flaky as the croissant. The chocolate was good, too -- it was all gone in a matter of seconds.I saved the mini roulé aux raisins for later. I ended up eating it on the bus; what a delightful little bite! Who could say no to a golden flaky custardy raisiny snack? Certainly not me!
We took a guided tour of Montreal on Saturday afternoon.  The tour guide told us this was a good place at the end of the tour when the bus passed by the place.  After the tour we stopped by to try the food since it was on our way back to our hotel.  It was almost closing time so they were not making any more sandwiches.  There were a lot of people ordering bakery goods so we also waited to order some to take them back to the hotel.The lady in front of us ordered 2 huge bags of croissants, which included several almond croissants.  We did not know what type of special she received since they were speaking in French.  I ordered 1 croissant and one chocolate croissant.  They were so good and we wanted more so we went back to the bakery.  When we went back the store was almost empty.  We ordered almond croissant and more chocolate croissant.  My daughter liked the almond croissant a lot.On Monday, we went back again and ordered more croissants.  Each croissant priced from $2.15 to $2.95.  We found out the special was on 6 items so we ordered 6 items.  My daughter also tried an apple cream pommes and it was very good.
walked in the store for some easy no frills food and i got was expensive food that was not terrible but i had better.I had the Dolce-vita sandwich that was mostly mustard flavor, bread was really hard but had great flavor. NOt a lot of meat on the sandwches..All 5 of my friends said the same thing..expensive food thats barely mediocre..maybe it was the day, slow day for them...
The only bad thing is that there is not enough seating. If it is nice out just walk down to Dorchester square, plenty of benches :)
I'm a sucker for french boulangeries.  Maybe it's my longing to be back in Paris and biting into a fresh baguette or the fact that the subtleties in flavor bring out your keenest taste buds.  My hubs picked up a vegetarian panini here a few days ago and it was so delicious I had to go back and get one for myself today.  The paninis are grilled perfectly and give you the nice crisp while maintaining the chewy softness of the bread.  I'm typically a lover of meat but the vegetable panini was filled with great veggies like eggplant and tri colored peppers that I didn't miss the meat at all.  What really hit the spot was their almond croissant.  Often you bite into the almond croissant, only to find that they were stingy with the almond filling.  However, Dore's croissant had the nice light crunch of a croissant, the chewiness of the bread, and the delightful almond filling to balance it all out. Though not as good as they make it Paris, this one comes real close!
Got the box of 6 mini macaroons & a cranberry pastry.  Thought that the cranberry pastry tasted a bit stale, but the macaroons were delicious.  Would def go back to try some other things here.
Love the sandwiches here -. Just baked french bread, your choice of cheese and some great meats or spreads. My preference is the Turkey sandwich. In the summer, I will pick up a sandwich and head over to Stanley park and eat it outside. Also lots of great pastries for breakfast.... or snack or even for desert. I always pick up a few things before I drive back home to Toronto. There are multiple locations around Montreal but this is centrally located if you in the downtown core. A great stop for a light  meal or breakfast.Highly recommended for a quick bite...
I don't know why none of the people in the reviews have mentioned about their Mango Raspberry Cake. I'm in so love with their Mango Raspberry cake and it's absolutely delicious :) it's so mouthwatering and I can have it at anytime of the day :) I haven't fallen in love with a cake so much, at any point of time. I would highly recommend the cake. It's a must try. PS: They also have mini cakes of the flavor, if you don't wanna buy the small sized cake for first try, but I bet the small size cakes, which has more cake, and raspberry flavor are the best. I love it!
Pretty staple place to go to get fresh bread and treats. Their 'pain d'erable' is only available in the maple syrup season and is definitely worth getting. I typically stock up and hoard it in my freezer so I can eat it all year because it is that good. Their fruit tart keeps me nice and fat while I am on fruit-tart binges. Also their hot cross bun is great. Muffins are good too. Actually, most everything is pretty good here and there are convenient locations all over town. Sure it is not your little unique-y place, but it is good, so do it!
got two chocolate croissants and 1 mini cake..  If i'm paying 2-3 dollar for a croissants at least enough chocolate for taste.
Boring, unsightly sandwiches but the pastries make me sooooooo hot. I wolfed down an almond croissant only to return a couple of hours later to share a plain one. Someone please teach me how to have more self control!!!!!!
Just a step from where we stayed while in town, we were so happy with pastries for breakfast we retuned for lunch. The coissant, and chocolate pastry were superb. I loved the turkey & brie sandwich with cranberry & onions!
Another of my go-to places for artisanal bread if and when I'm in the downtown area. Their baguette 36 heures is the real deal and their pain brioche is just buttery,calorie -dense wonderful, but at $6.25 you might want to watch the scarfing down. Their pastries are also just to -die- for fat heaven, but lately I seem to have lost the craving for French pastry, when it should hit me again, hello delicious calories and damn the cost(s)!
I've come here for breakfast twice and it's fantastic.  You get a delicious and filling breakfast of baked goods and coffee for very cheap! Go elsewhere and you don't know what you'll get.. I paid much more another day for a greasy omelet and toast.The cafe au lait is good, though for my taste they use a bit too much milk.  You may want to ask them to put more espresso or less milk.The baguettes are great, and they have for you to use butter, peanut butter, and jams.The apple pastry and croissants are very good.We also got some sandwiches to bring with me to the biodome to eat for lunch, which were very good.  If none of them in the case appeal to you, you can ask them to make a sandwich for you right then and there with whatever you like inside.  Thus, you have a delicious, fresh lunch that is far cheaper than going to an actual restaurant around here.I tried macarons for the first time here, and they were fine, although considering the fact that one tiny macaron costs about the same as a large croissant, it's not worth it to me personally.  But it was good to try.Overall, very nice place!
good for a quick bite and very convenient. the almond croissant was better than something you would get at ABP in my opinion
The baguette had a great texture, but the flavor wasn't there.  I wasn't a big fan of the macarons either (but I don't know what good macarons taste like...).  The croissant was good, but I've had better.Good seating area upstairs though.
Great service, awesome croissants, and  very interesting cheeses. I dumped like 30 $ there on a 10 minutes visit. Would totally do it again. The flower market across the street gave the place a real Parisian feel.
my fiancee and i came here for some french baked goods.. their almond croissant was a bit heavy for me.. their sandwiches were pretty damn tasty though as the bread is absolutely delicious.. i also recommend checking out their sweet potato soup which was quite good
Not a huge chocolate sweets fan, but this place knocked it out of the park. Everything on the menu sound amazing and the waffles with chocolate and ice cream was the best thing I've had in a while. The flavours are perfect not to sweet just right.Advice go with a few people this way you can all share each other's dishes.
I love the decor. The atmosphere of eating chocolate and watching the snow storm outside its huge windows is 5 stars!!!! The service we had that day was very good.Here it is more American menu options than Juliet et Chocolat. Lots of ice cream!!!!So badly craved the Black and White after seeing the pictures and I was NOT disappointed. Super good! Two scoops of ice cream with hardened chocolate drizzle on top, plus crispy chocolate dots for dipping. The waffle was great but thick! I like.Anyways it's 3 stars because they refused to refund my friend's $100 tip (this happened a while ago). Clearly a mistake! How dare they argue? It took 30 minutes to finally have them refund it. I think that's ridiculous.
If you're looking for a diabetic coma to fall in to, you have come to the right place! The smell of chocolate permeates the air of this crowded cafe. They somehow have managed to cram a large number of tables into their square footage while maintaining the navigability of the space.  With a menu so overwhelmingly large, it's a good thing the the staff is friendly and helpful and can help you navigate the sea of sweet that comprises their offerings. In addition to chocolate and sweets, they also have a selection of savory menu items, such as crepes and paninis. I ordered the breakfast crepe with spinach, feta, and egg. The spinach they used was fresh baby spinach and I was surprise to see the egg did not come inside my crepe but in the format of two perfect sunny side up eggs next to my crepe. As it turned out, I loved it that way! I got to dip my crepe into the runny egg yokes as one would points of toast. My only complaint was that Cacao 70 does not offer be channel sauce with their crepes, and so, the crepe was a bit dry.All in all, a great place to go as long as you don't mind leaving with a bit of a sweets induced tummy ache!
Perfect place for a date. After a meal, I was looking for a place to have fruits. Had a craving for fruits on that day. hahaShe suggested me Cacao70. We ordered a chocolate fondue for 2 :DI asked for extra fruits. Banana, strawberry, apple tastes good with chocolate.It was fun to deep fruits into chocolate. She was all excited about it. The waffle drives her crazy hahaStaff was very kind. Water cup was always filled up.The atmosphere was great. Great experience. I'm not a crazy fan about chocolate, but the extra fruits was really nice.Strongly recommend for date place. Excite her with damn chocolate haha
This place is utterly amazing, I traveled to Montreal for spring break (I know crazy right?), but it was absolutely wonderful! My best friend and I would go here every morning to order the illegal waffles, black and white waffles, the fondue, the best lazy breakfast ever and of course the Costa Rica 30+ chocolate drink. I wish there was something like this in the states. :(
Wanna get stuffed with chocolate (and/or sugar in general)? This is the place! Just upon entering the sweet chocolate scent hits you in the face. Come early in the afternoon or morning, since it can get pretty busy in the evenings (the place is rather small and craving a sugar hit, you won't want to wait).The menu is long, actually a bit too long if you ask me. It's very difficult to decide, unless you wanna come every day and try something different. Well, that was not the case here since we were in town only for a little while. If you are a party of at least two or three people, it's worth ordering an assortment of several things - Sweet Chocolate Experience or Sharing for Two or More, that way you get to try more and share instead of getting too stuffed by yourself.We ordered a Triple Chocolate Cake (kinda resembles Tiramisu), something we should have shared, cause it's too much for one person - too much chocolate in one go (if there is such a thing, you'll say... and there is!). Black and White Waffle - a huge portion of waffles, chocolate, ice cream and whipped cream (also a lot for one person), Hot Chocolate and a Strawberry White Chocolate Shake (a small one). A lot (too much) for one evening if you ask me. Everything was tasty, but tolling on our stomachs.Next evening we tried Strawberry and Cheesecake Crepe (the best decision I've made here), Tuna Sandwich with a side salad, Chicken Sandwich without sides and a Brazilian Coffee. Sandwiches were nothing special - too much bread and too little contents (in the end it's a chocolate place, not a sandwich place, sometimes I forget about these things). The crepe was a proper one and I would have ordered it again if ever in town. All in all a good dessert place, but try to hold yourself back a bit when ordering. Even if you're super hungry, you might get stuffed all too fast, so rather share and order twice, if needed. :)Staff is super helpful and they speak English - also the menu comes in English as well.
Food: Can't help it, love this place even though I don't like sweets that much! but the fondue is to die for! so good!!
This place is part of my top 5 places to go in Montreal! (Visit my page to read my other top 5 reviews!)Absolutely amazing! I always recommend this place to all my friends who visit Montreal. This little restaurant is an absolute gem. The place is very well decorated and very unique. Definitely in my top 5 places to visit if you ever pass by this beautiful city. I always get the "sweet chocolate experience for two." This place is the perfect place to go on a romantic date or have a great time with friends. What is more hilarious than laughing at each other with chocolate stuck on everyone's teeth? :)I would also recommend the crepes as they are really tasty as well! To be honest, anything on this menu is good. Highly recommended and a solid 5 stars! Well worth it I promise you!
Thank you for the wonderful chocolatey experience Cacao 70! This cozy cafe reminded me of Max Brenners in NYC. Looked like there was a mix of tourists and natives dining here. I'd definitely come back again and again as a treat for myself x) We ordered: - Chocolate, marshmallow pizza (came with strawberries and bananas which can be dipped in a small dish of melted chocolate) the bread was slightly sweet and combined well with the chocolate spread and the lightly toasted marshmallows. - American style hot cocoa (you can get this either with milk chocolate/ medium or dark chocolate) I got it with dark chocolate. Though delicious I couldn't finish it :P - raspberry parfait ice cream cup (loved the brownie bites in this one!)
It seems that the folks here in Montreal love their chocolate. We were overwhelmed with the choices on the "sweets" menu, but finally decided that you can't go wrong with chocolate fondue. The "single" Flaming Turtle  was plenty for the two of us and  included banana, strawberry,  pineapple,  waffles and brownie bites. The chocolate was a perfect consistency and the right amount for the items to dip. You could taste the mixed in rum sauce at the back of your throat....in a good way. We also ordered a spicy hot chocolate with curry and pepper. I would have liked it to be spicier and a bit hotter in temperature, but it was still delicious.   Other sections of the menu feature milkshakes, sundaes, chocolate for the purist, s'more's, crepes and waffles and on and on and on. It was slamming here on a Sunday night, but servers were friendly and unflustered. Seems like it would be a good choice for date night!
What a little piece of French Canadian Crepe heaven!  It's a great little brunch and dessert spot located near McGill that seems to be a favorite amongst college students.  On a Sunday morning around 10 AM we were seated without a wait. Fickle as ever we opted for the 70 salad, the Italian sausage frittata and the illegal chocolate waffle. The salad is a mixed green salad with feta and tomatoes topped off with a poppyseed dressing. It was quite good though I wished I had ordered the dressing on the side.The frittata was hot, came in a cast iron skillet. It was savory and filling. I was barely able to put a dent into it. The crown jewel of the meal was the illegal waffle. I will admit I like my waffle crispier than that but besides that it was a piece of heaven. The bananas were transformed into a "banana brûlée" with caramelized sugar. The order of operations was to then dip the banana or waffle in a chocolate sauce or whipped topping then top it off with these mini whopper balls. Unbelievable!They also have a dessert menu. No doubt we'll be back in the future. By the time we left it got quite busy so clearly this is no well kept secret.
It opens at 10AM, and there was already a line up! This place is super cute with a wide selection of chocolate as well. I think I ate way too much chocolate during this trip! We ordered a pretty big brunch, the bananas, strawberries and pineapples comes with it as a little treat! How nice! oh and don't forget about the melted chocolate dip!And brunch is served! That was such a nice little treat from the restaurant! I didn't expect that.My husband got the chicken egg sandwich. I got the egg, bacon, beans, bread, potatoes and sausages! They come in big big big portions!!! So make sure you go hungry!!I love the atmosphere of this place. Super cute! I would love to come back here for dessert!
Came here to try out a crepe and ended up having their chocolate stout. Really good food. It was light and perfect.
Cuteness overload. The front is a chocolate shop and the back is a restaurant good for brunch. The smell of chocolate wafts through the air leaving you hungry for sweets. Got the nutella and strawberry/banana crepe- portion was huge. It was exactly what I expected and wanted. My bf got the orange grand marnier crepe, which was good, but drenched in too much sugar. It was too heavy and I think I would have gotten sick from eating the entire thing (good thing he's a piggy and ate it all). The way they make the food here was like artwork. We sat by the open kitchen and watched the chefs skillfully drizzle chocolate on each crepe and decorate each dish to perfection. I think it was a fun experience to try it out, however, balancing a sweet dish with a salty one would have been smart.
Wow. everyone that visits montreal needs to stop by this place. Chocolate HEAVEN!!!! they have absolutely everything everything cocolicious you can imagine. I am not sure if this is a chain but i know that they have at least 2 locations in montreal.I came in on a week day for lunch after getting recommendations from a friend of mine and also reading about it on food blogs. I must say it does not disappoint! I went for the nutty waffle which consist of nuts with vanilla ice cream, nuts, whip cream, chocolate, nutty drizzles (i think hazelnut), bananas and strawberries. You can substitute your waffles for a crunchier type call cacao 70 for about 2 CAD more i think. I went with that and boy i devour that whole thing down in just a few. So goood!!! it' a bit sweet and quite a big portion for one to finish so i would suggest going with a friend if you can unless you are like me who is traveling on her own. so foodies if you are into nuts and chocolate i highly recommend this one! i was debating between this an the one on the special section "feel like chocolate" or the marshmallow and chocolate pizza. But both of the other ones seems a bit overwhelming for one so i went with this instead. Service was fast and pleasant. I would def come back again when I am in town next time around!
First time at cocoa 70, it's amazing...I had the brownie volcano with vanilla ice cream and it was out of this world...loved everything about it...the brownie was moist and rich and the ice cream so creamy. I also had cappuccino, loved it!!!
This place was a great alternative to my normal Montreal chocolate-centric restaurant which is Juliette et Chocolat. I honestly over did it on the chocolate here but every bit of it was worth it.My meal consisted of a waffle (very sweet, though i wish it wasn't candyish flavored) topped with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and chocolate fudge drizzle and white chocolate drizzle.  This included a side of warm milk and white chocolate to dip my ice cream of waffle in, if the drizzle was not enough, with an additional few grams of  milk chocolate ball toppings (I'm sure that there's some much more eloquent name for them).  The meal was very rich to say the least.  I OD'd on sugar and chocolate.  I only wish that the waffle wasn't ridiculously sweet and that one of the female waitresses wasn't  so non-attentive and nonchalant.  Overall good experience for a busy late evening snack though.
It was our first time here and it was a terrible experience. We were a group of 4 and the hostess and manager took over 20 minutes to get us seated. If there are no tables around, I get it. But there were 2 free tables that they could have stuck together, but when we asked the young girl who claimed she was the manager, she said it would be a (her actual words) "pain in the ass" to stick them together. I was shocked at her language. Who speaks like that to clients? At that point we did not want to wait any longer because they kept seating the people behind us, and did not seem to make an effort. We went to Juliette & Chocolat instead and enjoyed their professional and friendly service. Would never return here.
I was visiting Montreal from New Brunswick and had heard great things about this place. My boyfriend and I wanted something sweet after dinner, so we decided to give it a try. When we entered, we were seated immediately despite seeing a full restaurant. Service was friendly and fast (though it took us a while to figure out what we were going to get!) Once we figured it out,  (we got the "Feel like chocolate" plate to share) we certainly had no regrets! The only regret is that we didn't  have more time to taste all the delicious chocolate dishes! We also got boozy milkshakes (the Brazilian, I believe) and it was amazing. Such a great experience and very delicious treats! Will definitely be back again next time I am in the city.
Do you want Chocolate everything?And I do mean almost everything.It's like someone decided to single handedly support the chocolate market by opening this store so that Canadian chocolate lovers could get their fix.And this place is their dealer.Decent chocolate at average to above average prices.Crepes and waffles seem to be the popular thing here, but you know me, I'm all about the hot chocolate.After walking in the snow, who wouldn't want hot chocolate?Now all I need is a toboggan and a backpack for my adventure through Montreal.
The interior of the cafe was clean and organised, with lots of space in between tables so you can surely get some private time while dining there. Got the lazy breakfast and it was served with a mini fruit platter that came with melted chocolate on the side which was simply a treat. Coffee was pretty decent as well. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to have an exceptional brunch!
I still love going to Cacao70, but I think one thing I forgot to mention is the wait time. I was lucky that I only waited 20 minutes to get a seat. However, I was only with my partner. So  if you have a bigger group - it's definitely going to take a little longer. You want to take that into account. I believe the other locations (e.g. around Berri-Uqam) isn't as packed. But if you intend to meet here with a group of friends for, say 9pm, I recommend coming at least 15 minutes earlier.This time I went, my partner got a marshmallow and chocolate pizza, while I got the choco-nut waffle with ice cream. We always see people ordering the pizza, but I guess the idea never really sunk in to order one before. Definitely an interesting experience. Dough is basically pizza dough (I was expecting pastry) - with roasted marshmallows and drizzled chocolate. Mmm so good, but so filling. I don't know how he finished it. Especially since it comes paired with fruits and another mini-fondue of dark chocolate. As for my order - I loved the waffles as always. I also love the nuts on top - crunchy and sweet. The cream and ice cream melted really fast, and I'm not exactly the fastest eater - so my partner was taking bites here and there from my dish. I am definitely loyal to the Banana Split waffle - something about the caramelized sugar that seriously makes me drool. I do love how they also gave me fruit and mini-fondue though.
Breakfast is really great and staff are friendly. My friend and me had a very good time . Will come back again !!!!
This was my favorite meal in Montreal. I want to come back here a million times, alas.It was 10am and we wanted a french-canadian breakfast so where better to go than a crepe place? And Cacao 70 was even better than a crepe place, it was a CHOCOLATE place that serves crepes! Boy, everything we ate here was amazing!! Ordered the country ham, cheese and egg crepe which came with a small plate of six whole pieces of fruit with an AMAZING dipping chocolate sauce. The crepe itself was fantastic and literally bigger than my head, huge huge huge tasty crepe!!! We also got the nutella strawberry crepe with ice cream on the side which was even better (naturally, because of the nutella and chocolate aspect), even the ice cream was stand out. Not to mention the stand out cafe au lait and mocha ordered... mmmmmmmmmmmmHM perfection.All in all, favorite place ever. Need to come back to Montreal to eat here again.
We stopped here on the last leg of our weekend getaway to Montreal and were so happy that we did.  The place was pretty empty for a Monday afternoon so we pretty much had the place to ourselves.  Service was efficient and the crepes and milkshakes tasted wonderful.  This is a must visit place to get your chocolate craving extinguished!
Great place for desserts. Good location and nice staff. About the food:- chocolate and fruits crepe: not a good option for us. It comes with around 80% fruits, 15% crepe dough and only 5% chocolate. I missed more chocolate in the dish.- Mexican hot chocolate - delicious creamy hot chocolate. It comes with more chocolate than milk. - Triple chocolate fondue - deliciousTip: do the reservation, otherwise you will wait for a long time to get a seat.
it should be a 3.5. but soooo much better than juliette and chocolat. Fondue: gives you the option of one, two or three chocolates for the same price. The fondues are served with seasonal fruits, brownie and waffle bites. The portioni s large enough to share with two.the sharing sharing is a large portion that in my opinion can be shared with three people. Same at the fondue but is served with more stuff like a half nutella pizza. The pizzas are not good. The dough to topping ratio is not proportional and the dough is very dry making it hard to swallow. The caramelized banana waffle is very good. It's simple. waffle, with caramelized bananas and chocolate drizzled on top. The surgar on top of the bananas are torched making it chewy and adding a different texture to the plate. Satisfies a waffle craving for sure.The hot chocolate is not good, its too thick for it to be a hot chocolate and too watery for it to be a ganache and flavor is off. A very good date place and dessert for friends and lovers. I would recommend it
This place is amazing! I had the Nutella crepe and the Mexican Chocolate. It was soooo good! I definitely recommend this place, it's a must try.
Chocoholic. Period.Any chocolate lover should come here. The atmosphere is pretty casual and is a pretty good hangout with friends, but not to the point it's super crowded and uncomfortable. Their name says it all - chocolate. The fondue was amazing (you'll want at least 2 people for this); you get choices of fruits like strawberries, bananas, pineapple, marshmallows, chocolate brownie cubes (yup, more chocolate) and other surprises. My personal favorite was the brownie cube, it was super soft and chewy and would go great alone or dipped in some MORE chocolate. Also, give any one of their waffles a try - it's just more chocolate-y goodness. It might be a good idea to walk to this place as opposed to driving so you can find a place to burn off all that sugar you just inhaled.Just looking at their pictures makes me want to go back.
Sat down to have dessert with my wife today, cheesecake for me and crepe for her. The coffee was decent and the food was OKay. There was one little problem: fruit flies on the coldest day of the winter. That was it. Two or three fruitflies and we complained to the manager who didn't charge us for a partially eaten meal. She did ask my wife to pay for the coffee which we refused. Of course, If you see flies in this weather, it.means there is something wrong with the cleanliness in the kitchen. I also noticed there was an accumulation of furry dust on the walls which is off putting but the place was filled with eager customers. Go figure. Anyways, hygiene should be the utmost factorbin operating an eating establishment. We will never return.
Giant sticky menus, refrigerated counters of chocolates, a happy crowd of people laughing and quite possibly eating chocolate marshmallow pizza for dinner without judgement because why the hell not, super friendly chill service, in general it's hard to not be a fan of this place when you're in the right mood for it. I went with my family after a dinner in the area, there was no line when we arrived and we laughed and were dazzled by the indulgent menu but ended up sharing two ice cream parfaits, one with this delicious caramelized coconut topping and both with brownies, and it was good times.
Dont call "crepes from Brittany" when you obviously don't know what it is. Greasy and flavourless. Plus some clean would be nice considering this is just above the "kitchen".
There's not much that could go wrong when chocolate is involved; and this place knows how it's done. Been here multiple time and have never been disappointed. My favourite is definitely the triple chocolate fondue. I recently had their new homemade marshmallow dish with fondue and waffles for 2 which was also mouth watering. If you have never been this is definitely a place you need to go at least once and leave your diet behind you!
Ordered triple chocolate fondue. It came with fruits, brownies and waffles pieces. The brownie with chocolate fondue was really chocolatty!! If you are craving for chocolate this is a must! Mini waffles were disappointing, didnt taste like anything. Good place to go with girl friends. Prompt service good location.
I loved how they had an english menu but it was small and we still used the main menu which was all written in French! It was hard to decide what chocolate drink to try. I don't remember the name of the drink I chose but it was very chocolatey! I was hoping for some whipped cream or something fancy on top of it but I still enjoyed it. My boyfriend ordered some egg dish and I tried a bite. The ham was delicious! Probably the best I've ever eaten! I found myself asking for more, and luckily he was kind to share! We ordered the milk and white chocolate crepe but my boyfriend asked for all white chocolate. It was very sweet for me but my boyfriend really enjoyed it-he has a sweet tooth! We really liked it had free wi-fi since we both don't have international plans for our mobile phones. I don't really recall the prices but since we are from Los Angeles we didn't think it was any different. I also liked the waitress wasn't pushy for us to leave. We really enjoyed our time here especially since it was our first stop during our Montreal trip.
How to start describing the deliciousness of the chocolate, the waffles, the ice cream??!!. I go there all the time and absolutely love it
If you are a student and enjoy good company and good looking desserts, come here. Service at the kitchen and around the tables is not so great. Even with good quality products, the chocolate was room temp ( even after requesting to warm it up!) and server did not overlook our table after sitting down. We needed to request napkins twice! Anyways I don't think I'll come back with my wife and young kids again. We went to Juliette & Chocolat at DIX30 two weeks ago and it was far better than this.
This is one of my favourite places to chill in Montreal. Its the perfect palace for students and anyone who appreciates chocolate and its many forms. The fondue is the most popular thing on the menu, highly recommended, service is great but after 6 and during weekends can result in lineups near the door.
As a chocolate connoisseur, Cacao70 has made it into my top 5 places to go for a delicious and dangerous (in a good way) chocolaty treat. I'm not usually one to be out done by a dessert but that almost happened the night I wondered in here look for a sweet treat. I ordered the quadruple chocolate parfait which consists of chocolate ice cream, chocolate brownie bites, melted chocolate, chocolate whipped cream and chocolate sauce. It looked small compared to my companion's chocolate waffle topped with ice cream, but it packed a major punch. Every bite was just amazing. The restaurant it self was a nice size with a cafe vibe.  There's a display of different types of chocolates that you can buy by weight. They also have chocolate artisan candies on sale. I bought a small assortment for a friend and she loved them. This place is nice for small groups and kids. I'd recommend it as a cute place for a date night.
I went here for brunch with some friends and it was a nice spot with big open windows and friendly servers. I had the blue mushroom omelette which came with a small portion of fruits and chocolate fondue as do some other items on the brunch menu. Their chocolate is pretty good and they give a variety of different fruits. The portions are pretty generous too. My meal came with the omelette, 3 slices of bread and potatoes. It was good for the location and what we paid but the food isn't super unique.
Great desserts! Chocolate with everything. But get early. Had to wait like an hour to get seated
I went here expecting killer waffles.  The result were small, floppy and thinner than expected.  We took the platter for 2 which included a small flaming volacano to roast marshmallows, some strawberries and bananas to dip in milk chocolate.  I would have licked the plate if I didn't look like a fool.  I'll be back to try the other plates because nothing is better than chocolate.  It's slightly on the pricey side.
Went there for brunch with friend and thoroughly enjoyed it. Loved the menu choices and am looking forward to going back. The service was great & friendly.
Beware of the relatively big portions in this cacao heaven. The brunch omelettes have a side fruit dish with chocolate to dip in. Both omelettes and crepes are so well sized, by the time your cacao arrives you are already full. If you are cacao lover just focus on it as it is so good and is a meal by itself. BTW you can take your cacao home if you can't finish it. One thing for sure, chocolate beer, import from UK doesn't help either, but tasting a version of chocolate Guinness with your crepe seems to be appropriate although strange combination.  Service in this place is nice, on a crowded Sunday afternoon we were taken care of promptly. The only problem I had is all my cloths smelled deep fried after I left the resto.
Amazing dessert spot. Restaurant is almost always packed at night so get there early or you might have to wait in line! (granted the wait is never too long). Highly recommend the chocolate pizzas and fondues. I get them almost every time I visit and they're SO good. The chocolate pizza is definitely a sharing item cuz you might not be able to finish it on your own. The fondues come with fruits, marshmallows, brownie pieces and cookies so you can basically make your own smoore. Tried their chocolate drink once but it was actually pretty bitter so just a heads up to people who can't take dark chocolate that well (when they say dark they mean real dark). Highly recommend overall.
Slow service! Tried there spicy hot chocolate excellent choice. Don't think you can go wrong ..The vanilla and chocolate waffle was excellent, it's can be easily shared with two.
Nice decor, nice staff. Pizza is way too sweet for my taste, but crepes and fondues are pretty good. (Good food visual) I like to take their make your own parfait, portion is good for 2 people and not too expensive. Other things on the menu can be on the pricy side.
On the pricey side however the atmosphere is cute and cozy. I've been here a couple of times and the service is A+.-Good for brunching-The chocolate pizza is awesome-The crepes are decently large and quite good-Don't bother getting the sandwiches other things on their menu are a lot better and these are overpricedIt is a chocolate infused restaurant, so try something along those lines and dont be disappointed that their real food isnt up to your expectations.
Try their Fresh fruits with dark chocolate fondue. Hot chocolate with hint of orange was wicked good too. Fair warning - You may go nuts.
If you want to get your sweets / chocolate fix, this is the place to go. I went on a sunday night around 9PM and there was a short line up.We decided to go for the Choco-nut waffle and the Strawberry shortcake. Both delicious, except I found the shortcake a bit too dry. Would have added a bit more of strawberry syrup to make it more moist.Our waiter was nice and helpful, and service was quite fast.
Went here on a weekday around 4pm. There were only two other customers, and yet it took 15 minutes for them to take our order. The service is pretty nonexistent.We ordered a Nutella crepe with fresh fruits: raspberries and strawberries. The crepe was TERRIBLE. Both my boyfriend and I are French, and he is from Brittany (where crepes come from). This was not at all a "Breton" crepe like it claimed. The crepe was very thick (almost pancake like) and VERY rubbery. Really the worst crepe we've ever had. My boyfriend ordered the hot chocolate. He said it was really good, but not hot.
Cacao 70 is a great place to go to with people with different tastes, there's something sweet for everyone! The line to get in will be long (out the door even!) no matter when you go but don't get stressed if the host hasn't even looked at you, the time will be made up while (barely) waiting for your food after you order it! However, I would suggest asking them to bring you your bill at the same time as your food. I've waited for my bill for a long time before and having your bill with your meal allows you to leave when you want to and not have to wait all that extra time.For the atmosphere, it smells lovely in there (chocolate, of course!) and the decor is very chic. The tables for two are just the right size unless you each order a chocolate pizza, that's when it get's squishy. The last thing is that it's pretty hot in there so waiting in line with a jacket on could be brutal if you're someone who gets hot easily!When it comes to food, their chocolate fondues are the way to go! The chocolate is so rich that even a little bit is enough and having the fruit, peices of crêpe and brownies to dip in it only make it better! Their desserts are very decadent, leaving you with a chocolate high. Very nice presentation; very picture-worthy! Almost so nice you won't want to dig in- except for the fact that it looks so delicious!I would recommend having a healthy snack a couple hours before going here and not going on an empty stomach because it's just so much sugar! But don't have a huge meal either because these dishes, even when shared, are quite filling!It's always fun to try something new at Cacao 70 and free wifi is pretty great! I go at least once a month, definite recomendation unless you're impatient.
The classic chocolate fondue is really good, the fruits are fresh and the chocolate itself is very good (milk chocolate)
Posting the Byward Market - Ottawa location review here.Cacao 70 2nd Day opening - nice concept, thanks for opening in the Byward Market!!  Toronto next?  I think this would be BIG in Los Angeles Market - Irvine, Costa Mesa, Rowland Heights, Hermosa Beach, Santa Monica, Old town Pasadena??  maybe franchise it out?This is a chocolate lovers dream cafe...no calorie count posting!!Good service, by Adam.Loved the Chocolate Fondue.Good Luck Ottawa, hope to visit on my next trip.Get the Ottawa Yelp location updated!!
The ultimate dessert and chocolate place - must try!I'm well acquainted with Juliette and Chocolat which similarly specializes in decadent chocolate treats from hot cocoa to crepes, although I think Cacao 70 has a far greater selection.If you want to accompany some friends but aren't a chocolate enthusiast, they even have salads and wraps.Went on a Friday evening and it was pretty packed. There's a very cozy feel to the place, it's warm and a great setting for a date or groups to share good times over a huge fondue.I tried the tutti fruiti waffles served with a drizzle of milk chocolate, strawberries, caramelized bananas and vanilla ice cream on the side. For 13.50$, it is worth the size of the portion and could be filling as a meal itself. I also got their american style hot chocolate milk, which was extremely rich - I'm pretty sure there was more chocolate than milk in it and if let to cool down, it would solidify! Unfortunately it just gets too sweet and sickening, I was not able to finish everything I ordered despite having a light dinner beforehand.There should be a warning to consume in moderation. I will be going back as I'm eager to try some of their lighter desserts like crepes or cakes or perhaps just for a drink, they have smoothies and milkshakes too.
Walked in around 4PM on a weekend. The place was pretty packed but we were able to find a seat right away as we were a small group. Friend got the waffle and i went for the fondue. Both were good with really nice presentation, however unless you've got a serious sweet tooth this wouldn't be something i recommend. Both our totals came around under $20 tips included. Our server was super nice, helpful, and attentive. Reasons this place isn't 5 stars. 1. We asked one of the other servers for assistance since ours was halfway across the room, and we were kinda blown off. 2. It's pricey. I know i know pretty much all trendy places are pricey and this place was no exception, but still $14 for a waffle?! (Price is an estimation. I don't recall specifically) Anyways if you're fond of sweet things (and i mean SERIOUSLY fond, i couldn't even finish my fondue and i have 7 fillings from my sweet eating habits), this is a cute place to stop for a nibble.
I had the half portion of the chocolate marshmallow pizza, and it is VERY sweet, but good! I went with 3 other people and we each had a slice and were satisfied. Although it would have tasted better if the dough part was crispier. I also had the grilled vegetarian sandwich, and it was extremely bland, I wouldn't recommend it!Also had the Milk Chocolate Milk Shake - AMAZING! very tasty!The service was EXTREMELY friendly!!! Very good service! Atmosphere is also really comforting and relaxing!
Stopped for a light lunch. Staff very friendly, menus in both French and English. Had a ham and cheese crepe, was really nice light meal that came with a simple salad. Wife, being on vacation, went for straight up chocolate fondue. It was really good, came with fruit, brownies and waffle bits. Waiter saw that I was on the fence about having some and without us asking brought over some extra fruit for me to try. Nice touch. Probably a little pricier than it should be but still good overall experience.
We were in Montreal for four days and came here twice for brunch! (My sister has a chocolate addiction.) I opted for the fritatta, which was served with crispy bread. It came in a HUGE pan and was quite tasty, although watery at the bottom of the pan.Service was a little inattentive, although friendly. The other negative would be that the wooden decorative wall that we sat against had large clumps of dust that we were slightly worried about falling into our food.
Waited for 20+ minutes around 9pm on  a Saturday. Table management needs improvement but desserts were good. The main thing is the fondue. Dark chocolate fondue was good - how does the chocolate stay smooth without a flame? We had the one with pineapple, strawberries, bananas, brownie bits (dense and moist!), and waffle bits (fluffy!). I also had a chocolate crepe with banana (too ripe for my taste) which was ok, would be better with some icecream.
Great coffee and good fondue experience. This place should be a good visit for an authentic breakfast
What a treat!! Sooo decadent. We stopped for a snack and then couldn't even think about dinner. Delicious hot cocoa.
It was pretty cramped when I went. Food was ok but the presentation was really nice. Service was decent too.
After visiting Cacao 70 twice, I can say I was quite pleased by its food and atmosphere. They have a broad menu with an interesting variety of chocolate drinks, food (waffles, crepes, baked goods, ice cream, etc.) as well as smoothies and, for the ones who would prefer eating a proper meal, sandwiches and salads. Their brownies are moist, fresh and warm, and their hot chocolates are rich and tasty, yet not overbearing. As for the waffles they are good as well but, in my experience, a bit hard to digest. I would definitely recommend this place for chocolate lovers and I am looking forward to visit Cacao 70 again to try something new!
Really cool chocolatey place, I prefer over similar places in Montreal so if you want to have a pure chocolate delight you should definitely give it a try.Alternatively there are salty crepes for brunch :-) but why bother
My boyfriend and I visited my cousin in Montreal three weeks ago. We got to try a popular chocolate dessert cafe/restaurant called Cacao 70. They offered a limited selection of coffee drinks but I wasn't there for the coffee. Since it was brunch time, I was desperate to have some content into my stomach. I didn't want to order dessert because I had nothing in the morning and didn't want to be filled up on sugar. So I ordered one of their savoury crepes, The House Special (I think, I'm basing it off their online menu since I forgot to record it). It came with fruit appetizers that you could dip in chocolate before the main entree came. I definitely enjoyed the food! It was not crazily mind-blowing and unique, but it definitely gave me a fill and I was definitely content.I really liked the atmosphere and their chocolate-themed restaurant. You could also buy chocolate to take back with you if you wish. I didn't buy any only because they were a bit pricey for a bag.If I was to come back to Montreal (which I obviously am), I would definitely try their dessert crepes. Even if you hate chocolate (like my boyfriend), there is definitely something there for everyone.
Amazing! Melt a marshmallow on a fire that reminds you of a camp fire or have the fondue. Must go here if you love chocolate!
In need of Saturday brunch our hotel's concierge recommended this place. It was amazing. The restaurant is really cute and has an upbeat fun cafe vibe. It smells like chocolate as soon as you open the door. The menu has tons of options so everyone is bound to find something they would like. We both got frittatas which came served in a cast iron pan. They were perfect. To our surprise the frittatas came with fresh fruit and melted chocolate for dipping. I'm not a big chocolate fan but I have to say the chocolate was really delicious. The service was great. I would love to visit Cacao 70 again when returning to Montreal in the future.
I had a veggie fritata for brunch and it was sooo good. It was served with fresh fruits and melted chocolate which was also great. The tables are very small but the environment is comfortable. I will definately come back when i have extra money to spend
Good place, the location is convenient for me cause it's close to where I live.. but it's not my favourite desert place in MTL.. I don't like the taste of the chocolate that they use to be honest.. Their sandwiches are OK, noting special either.
Excellent crepes! I was so impressed with the quality of food and service! Would definitely recommend!
This is the sort of place that looks good on paper. An all chocolate restaurant? What a brilliant idea! Of course then you try it and it's good, really it is but it's expensive and well, it's fucking chocolate. You could melt your own to your tastes and not pay this much. The other problem is tha it's so rich, after a few bites, you're full from the 18$ treat you just got. If you're going to eat here, bring a group and share everything so you don't waste money on being full and queasy seconds later from a cocoa overload.
if you are in Montreal, you need to come to cacao 70. You won't be disappointed with their menu. Everything I eat here is amazing.  Each time I have a friend visiting me, I bring them here. Try the Lazy Breakfast or the black and white crepe for Brunch. You won't regret.
Now as I am not a chocolate lover *GASP!*, I don't quite have the capacity to fawn over the majority... or almost any of this menu. BUT, I do know that the staff are knowledgeable, friendy, and that the atmosphere is terrific. I have seen cute couples enjoy the fondue sets and have an appreciation for their tea selection. The menu is about 90% chocolate so I found myself eating a Turkey sandwhich, and although it was a little over my usual cafe budget, it was soooo tasty (blueberry AND cranberry sauce - YUM). You can't call yourself a chocolate fan if you've never been, please have the s'mores so I can live vicariously through you!Food:  8/10Service:  9/10 - friendly and informative, personalized staffPrice: 9/10Atmosphere: 9/10
I stumbled on in here 7 minutes before they were done taking orders -- yes, I remember the waitress specifically saying I had 7 minutes left to order. I wouldn't call that the most humble welcoming, but it's fine. It didn't bother me much because I was too out of it to care. I ordered a nutella crepe, and just like anything involving nutella, it was amazing. The crepe was perfect, not burnt and not undercooked. The nutella was rich and they aren't stingy with their serving of it either.Cacao 70 is any chocolate-lovin'-sweet-tooth addict's heaven. You won't be disappointed!Fuhrealz.
I could have died happy after eating at Cacao 70! This was the perfect establishment to get my crepe fix when I was in Montreal on vacation.Firstly, let's start with the decor. It was chic and trendy with a touch of hipster, so I was immediately obsessed with everything they were about. Though the extensive line was a bit discouraging, my friend and I decided to stick it out. The wait wasn't too bad, but it definitely helped that there were only two of us. We seated right by the open windows, which was appreciated on a beautiful summer night, and we were given our menus that were a small example of what you could be served if you were in heaven. I chose the chocolate raspberry crepe, and oh my goodness gracious, it was sweet, tart, and absolutely delicious. What I experienced is what I like to call a "food-gasm." It's exactly what it sounds like. I couldn't have asked for a better crepe to make my stay in Montreal perfect.Though the place was terribly crowded, I did lose myself in the food and found myself ignoring everyone around me. For an establishment to do that was quite blissful.
Been travelling all around the world and I must say this place is amazing. Went there with my date and we had an amazing time. Service is excellent, the ambiance is great. Desserts are amazing and will go back again. Thank you Cacao 70
Was originally directed to a poor table next to the cash, asked for window, then was asked to move from it.  Ordered a vegetarian sandwich; sliced tomatoes and spinach, chunky-melty white stuff.
Funny thing. I'm not sure if I really like or somewhat dislike this place. The chocoholic in my loves it. The hot dark chocolate is yummy and who wouldn't like a chocolate dessert style pizza?!? That said, I also find the open industrial unfinished rustic look too cold and uninviting for the warmth and coziness that chocolate represents. The menu, which is a tad predictable and unoriginal, could benefit from more creative dishes and I was disappointed by some of dishes on more than one occasion. If ever you have a hankering for a chocolate & oatmeal breakfast, I'd avoid it here. Rather lacks in any taste and the use of milk chocolate instead of dark only adds to the blandness. That said, do try one of the sweet creamy cocoa oozy dessert pizzas. You'll feel like Miss Piggy, but it'll satisfy that sweet tooth for a while!
Went back to Cacao 70 this past weekend and was really hoping that they made the leap to homemade marshmallows. Sadly, not :( I was particularly disappointed for two reasons, one because they told me the first time I visited that they were going to be switching to homemade, and second because they were making a big deal about their s'mores. I still like the place, don't get me wrong, but I really think that marshmallows are just too easy to not make from scratch, especially for s'mores.
A place completely dedicated to chocolate, ahhhhh!! I was so eager to go, I took a good 30 minutes at home to check out the online menu beforehand. After much deliberation, I picked a chocolate pizza, and decided then and there, that that would be it. If you don't make your mind up pretty quick, be warned, you might fall into a stupor! Will you have a...waffle? a...brownie?a...sundae? The options are mind-blowing, but if you happen to be with friends, a sure bet would be their plates for two, so you can sample everything. We were seated very quickly, and as so many other reviewers have mentioned, the space is lovely, if a little cramped. I guess what they lack in space, they make up in portion size! My chocolate-ricotta pizza arrived on some sort of marble counter-top, which was odd, and incredibly heavy. Sorta tough to maneuver when eating. The pizza was good, and had a nice balance of salty and sweet. The waffles are beautiful, but I'm not sure the spongy texture is my thing. The mini-brownies on the other hand are great! The highlight of the meal was the raspberry-chocolate sundae. That thing is pure decadence. It's massive, it has brownie chunks in it. Gah! Would totally recommend!I wasn't crazy about the service though. My biggest gripe about the place is actually the chocolate. Sad face. It's very sweet and I wonder if they don't prefer the use of candy-level chocolate as opposed to the purer stuff..
Great place, lovely decor. Was really crowded when I came, but the food was great! A lot of the items are really pricey though. I liked that they allow substitutes for marshmallows.
I had the nutella raspberry crepe and it was one of the best thin crepes i ever had, in terms of texture and taste! The staff is extremely friendly. The atmosphere is so cute ( perfect to bring ur date guys!). I went with my girlfriends and we absolutely loved it! ++ very affordable for the quality AND quantity served!!
even on a busy night & made-to-order menu items.. the food arrives to your table in such an awesome timely manner it's amazing... BECAUSSEEEE ... the desserts are so delicious! even just reading through the menu makes you drool. i've had the pleasure of indulging in the Choco-Nut Waffle on two different occasions while on vacation in Montreal earlier this month. the batter of the waffle is something i've never tasted here back in the states & it's a flavor i will continue to crave until i find my way back to canada. fluffy, warm, & tasty complete with that made-from-scratch touch. items are pretty pricey here, but everything in canada is expensive. luckily the price is completely justified in the quality of food. service is wonderful & you gotta love when a cafe is all hipstered out perfect for your instagram pix lol. love this place, 5 stars no doubt.
God damn addictive!!!! Nuff said .. Lol it's like a diner, their sandwiches are really good and the pizzaaa, sugar overload!!! Never get tired of this
Crowded place, I went with friends on sunday afternoon. The chocolate is good bu a bit pricey.Now the service is TERRIBLE! We were 3 friends and got a table (after the looong line). Then 15min later a 4th friend shows up at our table and the waitress refuses to serve him. Apparently it is against their policy to serve 4 people on a small table. We told the waitress we could accommodate, the boss came and told us that we would have to go back to the line up. Again. How retarded.
Oh yeah! This place knows a thing or two about good hot chocolate, waffles and crepes. If you're craving something sweet, you owe it to yourself to visit Cacao 70. My personal favourite is Cacao 70 Vintage Strawberry Shortcake for $10.25. The service was prompt, the atmosphere was good and did I mention their Grilled Marshmallows Cacao? mmmm it's delicious. I'm salivating just thinking about this place. If you have a sweet tooth, you'll be thankful you stopped by that place.
On my last last adventure I visited the lovely city of Montreal.I saw this restaurant  and had to try it. Oh my Goodness this place was Sooooooo Good! I went back two days in a row.The first day I had the veggie frittata and to my excitement it came with a tray of fresh fruit w/chocolate dipping sauce!The second day I had the raspberry chocolate crepe with a bowl espresso and milk Mmmmm delicious!If I had more time in that wonderful city I would have gone there everyday to experience a different plate of chocolate and food.
Upon entry, I was seated immediately despite the restaurant seeming to scream "no more, too many already". And it was a good spot too, at the back with 3 chairs, even though it was for just me and one other. Place was like a sauna! Sweat gathered on my nose. Not complaining 'cause it was a snowy day (hopefully the last for this winter and note to those from warmer cities like me, there is snow here at the end of March sometimes). Waitress was cheery. All smiles. I wasn't seated for even 5 minutes and she asked me what I'd like to drink while waiting for my friend. Just water was fine. And what was super great was that they gave a water jug and 2 glasses with the menus! Not many places do that apart from some Korean restaurants. Yay! I ordered the banana split waffles and my friend took the choco-nut waffles. They were similar except that she had strawberries with her bananas and I had choco wafer balls with bananas, which were, in addition, caramelized. Oh! And hers had whipped cream (I was slightly jealous about that). All in all, a good meal at a good price ($14.5 + tax). I walked out thinking this place is a tad better than Juliette et Chocolat. Bigger portions and wider selection of desserts and non-sweet dishes.
Food was good, not great. Service wasn't good. Mildly dissapointed. Very cool concept though.
My to go to dessert place! Awesome for casual meet ups! Its afordable & delicious what more can one ask for? Ive tried different types of dessert snd my top 1 is the pizza , its just so tasty! I love it
The chocolate offerings which we sampled (100% and 55% hot chocolates, single dark fondue) were "A-OK". I might even say that the hot chocolate was a pleasant surprise. My girlfriend ordered a house special crêpe - it was also acceptable. Not too impressive, but surpassed passable, considering that this is a specialty chocolate spot.The staff were hard-working and pleasant. The environment was busy, a touch cluttered, but comfortable.The sole detracting factor of this location was the abundant presence of fruit flies. We were swatting away at our food and drink during the entire experience. It's March...Final note: at the time of our visit, their Internet was failing intermittently.
Wow!! Love this place, great vibe, perfect for desserts after dinner, whether you are on a date or with friends, perfect to satisfy a sweet tooth. Their desserts look really good, especially the hot chocolate. We got the chocolate fondue because we were way too full from dinner. Got a single order to share between the two of us, the triple chocolate fondue allows you to have three different kind of chocolates swirled in the pot. We had the dark, semi sweet and white chocolate. It comes served with pineapple chunks, strawberry, waffle bites, and brownie bites. I wish there was more varieties of fruits but it's still a good value at under $9. I'd totally go back.
it's a bit on the pricy side but totally worth it..i go there mostly every other weekend and oh do i enjoy it!! their coffee is always on point and all the waiters are friendly even though it gets so busy especially on sundays..the chocolate pizza,classic hot chocolate and the sweet experiences are all must trys
Service is terrible, TERRIBLE. Its like they are actually paying us to go and have food there. This place is so crowded and loud, you can't have a proper conversation . I think it's a little bit overpriced too, the plates are well presented and everything but it's not wow. I went there twice and I think i'll end up going to juliette et chocolat instead, much much better.
Friendly prompt  service. Clean restrooms. She had the 'lazy breakfast', a hot skillet of scrambled eggs, baked beans, bacon, sausage (tasty), ham (sugar cured and not to my taste), potatoes, and toast. I had the 'blue mushroom omelette', mushrooms, spinach, onions and Swiss cheese. It was very good and accompanied by seasoned, roasted potatoes and toast. The meal came with a surprise appetizer of fresh strawberries, pineapple, banana and delicious warm melted chocolate for dipping. We had planned to try one of the desserts for which they are known but were pleasantly full after our breakfast and will have to go back again to try the desserts and crepes. She had a hot Americano she said was "strong enough to bounce a bull". I was disappointed with a weak nearly flavorless iced coffee. In all a satisfying way to break the night's fast and after a brisk walk back to the Sheraton, a pleasant morning.
Well...looks like Juliette et Chocolat has a competitor now..although the charm of J&C  is still my fave, the quality of this place might slightly surpass J&C.Cacao 70, for those of you who don't know, is a newish chocolate place nestled between du Fort and Chomedy on St Catherines. It's a cute little place with a MASSIVE list of chocolate options ranging from drinks to crepes to ice creams to cakes and even to chocolate pizzas! I've been a handful of times, and each time I push myself to try something new. Happily, I'm never disappointed! It's a little on the pricey side (at ~9 for a hot chocolate), but totally worth it! Go try it out - I promise you won't be disappointed!Oh and, they even have savory snacks (amazing sandwiches!)
Ordered the American hot chocolate, semi-sweet and it was very creamy and tasty.  Very nice to have a real hot chocolate somewhere, especially in cold canada!
Hands down my favourite place to eat in Montreal!  When I stumbled on this little gem online the fat girl in me was ridiculously ecstatic!  A restaurant that served mostly chocolate?!  I was sure I'd died and gone to heaven.  It was recommended for brunch or dessert(can't figure out why), so I thought my daughter and I could go there after the half marathon.  Wrong.  I was too tired after the half and went back to the apartment to sleep.  When we woke up we figured chocolate for dinner was the perfect post race reward.  They don't take reservations on weekends.  We arrived around 8 pm on the Sunday night to a small line.  We waited.  Glad we got there when we did because that line quickly grew.  I knew we'd made a good dining choice when people waited in that long line.  After maybe a 15 to 20 minute wait we were seated.  Our waitress kept coming around to take our orders, but we were so overwhelmed with all the chocolate options we didn't know where to start.  Finally we started on beverages.  I ordered a chocolate raspberry soda and my daughter got the chocolate orange one.  They were so tasty!  All my sodas should be chocolate!  We finally decided on meals.  My daughter got the the Black & White Waffle and I chose the Banana and Nutella crepe.  Afterwards I wished I picked raspberry instead of banana as I can get the banana kind here in Calgary(although not as good... not gonna lie).  However, I loved it.  It was a huge serving and was delicious!  So much nutella and lots of banana.  My daughter's waffles was huge with a scoop of chocolate ice cream, whipped cream, black & white chocolate sauce and little chocolate crisps.  I managed to eat all mine.  My daughter maybe ate 1/3 of hers.  We split the rest for breakfast the next day!  We were hoping to split a dessert(yes, on top of chocolate loaded dinner), but that did not happen.  We were much too full.
The dark chocolate milkshake is arguably the best milkshake I have ever had in my life.  The waffles were also great and the fondue was good.  The Sweet Chocolate Experience, meant for two, was huge. The menu is big and diverse with an impressive selection of chocolates.  They also have several items of regular non-chocolate food as well.  The service was good and the staff was knowledgeable.
I'll start off by saying I'm really not a chocolate person and just walked into this place with a couple of girls for a coffee... We chose the "sharing sharing experience for 2" and let me tell you, it was well worth it. The plate had chocolate fondue, marshmallows, strawberries, wafers, waffles, dessert pizza, and it goes on and on. Every single bite was better than the one before. Although the caloric intake is through the roof, it was well worth it!!
Quite expensive. Although, that doesn't seem to stop the long waits and lineups. Dessert pizza is very tasty but again, the price doesn't seem justified. The service can be very poor. For example, on one visit, I literally gave the waitress the last bit of money I had in my wallet... 5$. She had brought us 2 dishes and had returned once to ask if everything was to our liking. That's it. That's the extent of her work. 5$ was a very decent tip, just under 18%. I like to tip well when service is good. Which it was up until then. As I handed her the 5$ I said "this is all I have..."   She took it , her grin changing to irritation and she turned around and walked away without so much as a thank you. I left knowing I would never return. I can eat some Nutella at home, thank you very much. I don't need some waitress with entitlement issues giving me attitude. If someone gave me all the cash they had in their wallet, which was by no means a bad tip, I would thank them kindly. Not be a miserable b to them. Unfortunately this was enough to make me never return. And honestly had I known she would react that way, I'd have kept my money. I work hard too.
This is how you do business right.Nice place, great food and drink, knowledgable and energetic staff, and consistency.Keep it up guys this is why you are always full.
Stopped by for Sunday brunch.  Both the food and service were excellent.  We were seated as soon as we arrived and for the entire meal the service was fast. Our waiter was friendly, attentive, and answered all our questions. The menu is full of choices, so we will have to return again and again. Our crepe was very good and came with an "appetizer" of fruit and chocolate dip... a nice touch.  The granola with fruit, yogurt and chocolate drizzle was also very tasty. We highly recommend Cacao 70, but time your visit carefully, it can get very busy.
The best chocolate and brunch restaurant. Its a great place to hang out with friends and enjoy all kinds of chocolate foods including pancakes, foundues, chocolate pizzas and much more! Go check it out you wont regret it!!
They have quite a bit of diff chocolate items to choose from. Drinks, food, etc. tried dark frozen hot chocolate, the Italian pudding like cocoa, and chocolate pizza.  Get ready to spend a bit though for dessert 1/2 pizza is about $14 and drinks are @ $9 so this can be an expensive dessert experience. Items are rich so keep it simple as over indulgence is a given here.  And there is such a thing as too much chocolate.
This is a delightful place, especially for brunch! Our server was very knowledgable about the menu, and was appropriately able to recommend items to us. The portions are large, but not immense. The melted chocolate with fruit is delicious. So are their waffles, and smoked salmon ciabatta sandwich. Service was rather quick and the ambiance is relatively vibrant. The only thing was that the manager on duty (doubling as a host) was a bit inattentive (took ten minutes to seat us (there were tons of tables available, but one has to wait to be seated), primarily because he was engaged in conversation with someone instead of manning the host area) and had a severe scowl on his face (so I hope he was just having a bad day). Otherwise, great place to go!
People wandering in off the street always seem a little bit confused after stepping inside Cacao 70, but if you are a chocolate lover than without a doubt you're in the right place.  The staff are friendly, they'll get you seated in a nice place with menus and water, and sample of one of their delicious chocolate drinks.  I'm a fan of the warm natural wood interiors and chill feel of the place. Free wi-fi is always a nice touch.Select from any of their huge selection of chocolates from a variety of regions and they'll turn it into a rich and silky smooth chocolate drink that makes this place unique.  A stop at Cacao 70 isn't complete though unless you sample one of their chocolaty desserts, honestly I drool over every one, but perhaps a chocolate pizza is a great choice, or maybe one of their warm chocolate lava cakes for a more intimate occasion.Their complete focus on quality chocolate drinks and desserts are really what make this place stand out from the crowd, but as others have mentioned it's a bit pricey.  Over $10 for a drink and about the same for a dessert, add in tips and it's a certainty that you'll walk away lighter in the wallet and heftier through the waist.
the waiting time is long but the food is always amazing, my all time favorite the marshmallow bbq and choc crepe, it has become a traditional between me and my friend to always take our dessert at cacao 70 after our meal on st-catherine, i always bring my visting friends there, its a must in Montreal !
I would strongly suggest that if you go to Cacao 70 you REALLY like chocolate. There is barely anything on this menu that isn't chocolate, chocolate infused, or extremely sweet. The good thing is that I really like chocolate.The service is really slow here so I hope that you aren't in a rush. It took about 10 minutes to get my coffee (iced) and in the end I had to send it back because my husband watched the guy make it. He used his FINGER to stir the coffee. The waiter understood and brought me a a new coffee and obviously at no charge. I was trying to find something relativity healthy to eat for my daughter to no avail. We ended up getting her just strawberries.  The food simply wasn't as amazing as I thought it would be based on the Urbanspoon ranking of "10 Top in Montreal", so maybe I went in with high expectations.I would probably go back if I was having a chocolate fit.
Love love love this place.  So glad they are expanding now, such an amzing concept.  Chocoholics heaven.The  chocolate is sooo rich so pace  yourself.  I know the menu is super hard to choose  what you  want, and everything looks so good but I would recommmend only  a few chocolately things in one sitting. Great date place, with awkward  chocolate fondu mess- very sexy. Recently had the nutella ricotta pizza, love how they pair some things you don't  normally have with chocolate.  I would love to see more unique twists and combinations, more spices etc. Of course to really experience it you have to  get a Cacao;  so many to choose from and then  you make it just the way you like it with the  right chocolate type and  milk ratio.Of course  most of the chocolate drinks are super duper rich  so you  will be spending quite a while here to enjoy them; perfect for a cold  rainy day.  I know alot of first timers feel weird asking for a to go cup to take their cacoa but it's totally normal.
This place is amazing. The hot chocolates are shareable and the brunch items are too.
If you're a chocoholic then Cacao 70 is your version of Heaven.  They have a wide variety of chocolate-related goodies on their menu and, in my opinion, absolutely give Juliet et Chocolat a run for their money. That being said, I don't particularly care for J&C as there's nothing extraordinary about them and I've found their desserts to be somewhat lacking in chocolatey goodness. Anyway, the first thing to note about C-70 is that there always seem to be a line-up so be prepared to wait. I stopped in on a Saturday night around 10pm and waited about 30 minutes for a table.   As I looked around, I realized that everyone had gigantic portions of whatever it was they were eating (C-70 is definitely not cheap on portion size!) so when the waitress came over, I told her I wanted something relatively light and you know, not the size of a soccer ball. I ended up ordering the Raspberry Brownie Parfait.... which was huge! It was made up of real raspberries, whipped cream, chocolate brownie, melted chocolate AND chocolate sauce. AND ice cream. Holy Jesus, that's a heart attack in a glass, just waiting to happen. I did opt out of the ice cream part of the show but regardless, this dessert was VERY rich, although be it delicious. I was only able to eat half because my body just couldn't handle so much chocolate overload in one sitting.   I had also ordered a latté.... not realizing that they were going to make it with chocolate milk (using real melted chocolate). SO, I got a double dose of chocolate insanity and I didn't sleep all night. Definitely worth a trip, though I suggest sharing something or going on an empty stomach. Mmmm.... choc'late.
Extremely packed with people at all hours and overpriced for what it is. The cake I had was fine, nothing to write home about.
I am not a huge fan of chocolate but the place really gives you the choice. You can have a cup of single origin hot chocolate and it's fantastic. Deserts are amazing, waffles and crepes but too much of a chocolate at the same time. If u come to try every bit of something each time you come it's definitely worth it. Nice location and place is very coz inside. As you can read I do not have a sweet tooth but for a chocoholic it's a place to go.
I visited Cacao 70 again tonight, and was again astonished by the quality/originality of their desserts! This time, I ordered the triple chocolate pizza, and didn't regret my choice AT ALL. Scrumptious sweet, indeed. I literally died inside! My clothes might be slightly tighter tomorrow morning, but every single bite was worth it! :)This place is a GEM! The ambiance is very laid-back (great music), and the service makes you want to come back to taste some more of their baked goods. Will be back for sure!
my girl bought me here. we ordered the banana split waffles and the cheesecake.The waffles banana split was more show and no go. Lots of Belgian waffles with a single dollop of ice cream. One sliced banana with caramel on it, side of chocolate balls and chocolate sauce. The whole thing was too dry for me. It was pretty to look at, but didn't have the awesome, wet ice cream dripping, fudge dripping taste that im used to in a banana split. I felt like I was eating bread with ice cream. With a little bit of decoration on the side. They should instead use like 3 scoops of ice cream and douse the entire thing in sauce.The cheese cake was a mound covered with whip cream. Its not a traditional slice. Imagine a dollop of cheese cake covered in a mountain of whip cream. The actual cheesecake was much more on the tangy and sour side rather than being sweet.Im sure it's a good place, I guess I just like a different style.
This place is chocolate heaven. Went here on a winter night when visiting Montreal.  Everything from the chocolate and the ambience just hit it out of the park. I've been to another chocolate establishment in Montreal (The name of it is Shakespeare inspired, so I'll let you guess.) yet this place is so much better.
This place was packed when I went. Tons of college students. The service was mediocre. They seemed to be having trouble with the high volume of customers.I tried a waffle and a fondue. The waffle was way too sugary and the ice cream was icy and bland. The fruit (strawberries and bananas) was okay, but overall it was just sugar overload. For how much you pay, I was expecting higher quality food.Next time I'll head to a bakery for dessert instead.
this is more of a 3.5 stars but since we cant give half a star..its chocolate heaven but its pricey. im guessing its because i can get better chocolate for a tad less. nonetheless, its a good place to relax and enjoy with some friends, go on a date or do some eavesdropping if by yourself.. i usually stick with the chocolate beverage as its the best deal
One star for terrible service.We came here for a late brunch on our last day in Montreal. No complaints about the food. I liked the fresh fruit and melted chocolate that comes with the brunch platters. Nice balance to the savoury sandwich I had. I had the open faced chicken and egg sandwich which was quite good. Chocolate pizza was pretty good as far as the chocolate goes but the dough was a bit thick and overwhelmed the chocolate.We were seated at a tiny table which would have been fine if we were drinking two mugs of hot chocolate. However, the plates for brunch platters and the chocolate pizza are enormous. You can really only fit 1 plate comfortably and 2 if you really squeeze. Our server brought out the fresh fruit and melted chocolate part of the brunch platter first. Within 5 minutes, before I had finished the fruit, they brought out NOT the rest of the brunch (i.e. sandwich and omelette) but the chocolate pizza. We thought it odd to serve the sweet stuff first before brunch but ok, whatever. We worked on the chocolate pizza. AGAIN, in less than 5 minutes, the server showed up to announce that the brunch entrees were out but that they would wait until the table gets cleared up a bit more after we finish the pizza. Clearly our food was getting cold at the pass while we tried to eat the pizza as fast as we can. Before we could finish the pizza, the server just came out with the brunch plates and put them down on the table anyway despite just announcing earlier that he would wait. At this point, the plates were spilling over the edges of our tiny table and we are literally contorting ourselves trying to eat. The napkins had nowhere to go and our server just tossed them on top of the FOOD and rushed away. Needless to say we were completely flabbergasted by this terrible treatment that was completely non-sensical. Even when we had finished the pizza, our server ignored our table and did not take away the stone so that we could have more room with our plates.Would never go back.
On our trip to Montreal, my friend and I bookmarked this place for a sweet dessert experience. We had dinner and then gave ourselves a couple of hours of museum time before heading here for our lovely chocolate experience for 2. I am a chocolate fiend so I was very excited to come here in general and the atmosphere didn't disappoint. We were brought a bucket of marshmallow roasting supplies and waited for our plate. I took issue with a couple of things right off the bat. First, I know it comes with one milkshake, which as an experience for two is kind of lame, but this isn't a beautiful tall shake. It comes in a short tumbler and it's basically a tasting portion. That being said, it's one of the best milkshakes I've ever had.The other thing was that we were supposed to get strawberries and bananas, as per the menu, but we got pineapple in lieu of strawberries. It was fine because I love pineapples but it would have been nice to have been warned about the substitution.The waffle tasted a little weird and my friend pointed out that it was a little undercooked in the middle. We didn't really touch it. The grill for the marshmallows runs out so after that, play time is over. The dipping sauce was great and the crunchy wafer balls were as well. I saw a couple of other delicious chocolatey concoctions at other tables so I'd return to try those. But it's a lot of dessert even for two people.
Really cute place to have a hot chocolate.When we first walked in we were promptly greeted and seated with the menus. Atmosphere is quite nice; woody chalet feel with good lighting which is ideal for someone who wants to study. Shortly after sitting down, a waiter came over with a cute bottle of water and two little cups filled with both the dark and milk chocolate bases for the hot cocoa. Nice complementary touch to help you decide what you want to drink and eat.I had the lactee superieure hot chocolate with the milk cocoa base. It comes in two parts.... 1) you have a high ball glass with the bottom filled with your choice of chocolate 2) a cute metal measuring cup with the base of your choosing. You have a spoon to mix it and voila!!!! heaven in a glass.  My choice of chocolate was really good..... it smooth and velvety. Drank it with no problem :)My friend had the Milk frozen hot cocoa. She drank it all and really liked it. I didn't have a taste so i can't explain it in great detail. But she seemed to enjoy it considering it was gone within 5 min. :)Prices are on the steeper side..... 10.50$ with tax for my drink, not including tip. It is to be expected considering it is premium chocolate. Too bad we had just came from the noodle factory or i would have had something to eat.Next up at cocoa 70......... The amazing pizzas or maybe a waffle?!?!?!  stay tuned for my review :)
To preface, I must admit that the reason why I'm about to give Cacao 70 such a blah review is because I built my expectations up so high from reading all the wonderful reviews on urbanspoon and yelp. So I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by how warm the ambiance was. I liked the large open kitchen and the wooden counters. I liked the fairy lights and the spacious seating area. My friend and I were lethargically greeted and seated by a guy who looked like he wanted to just get out of there. My friend got the Cioccolata Calda (Italian-style Hot Chocolate) and I got the %70 Fleur de Cao which was different than her's which was hot chocolate where as mine was cocoa based. We also ordered the Cacao 70's Cheesecake. The drinks came and they were actually really delicious. I have to say that I've never had hot chocolate/cocoa this good. They were rich and thick and creamy. If anyone has seen that scene in the film Chocolat when Vianne is pouring cocoa into the cup for Armande and it's perfectly dense and rich... well that's how our hot cocoa/chocolate was. I liked her's more, it did have quite a thicker consistency, allowing her to drink with a spoon. I wish mine also came in a cup instead of a  fishbowl-like glass which made it hard to drink from since it was quite hot after pouring in the cocoa. It also detracted from the warmness that you should feel from drinking cocoa, I feel. But what I didn't like...well a lot actually. First the price. I'm sorry but $8-10 for hot chocolate? Really? Sure it was really good, but I'm not used to paying so much for hot chocolate. Secondly, the cheesecake. Presentation wise, I'd give it a 1.  It gets 1 point for drizzling red raspberry sauce on the plate, ok fine another point for nice cut strawberries. Otherwise, it really seemed like they scooped (yes scooped) the rest of the cheesecake that was left and plopped in on our plate, smothered it with whipped cream and called it a night. It must have been some excellent quality whipped cream that we were paying for then because that's mostly what we ate. The little bit of cheesecake I guess was okay.We couldn't finish our drinks because we were too full. I don't think there will be a next time for me but I'd recommend just getting either a dessert or drink. The drink would've been satisfactory for me. Whatever you do, just don't get the cheesecake.
AAAAAAAAMAAAAZING! That is all that can be said about this delectable dessert place. I had toasted my smores on the table, and on another occasion had their black and white waffle. Yum yum - n'uff said! You have to go and try it, but be sure to make reservations! It gets really crowded.
Poor customer service!!!! If you see  a lot of people waiting there, it does not exactly mean that the place is good. It is probably because the waiters don't give a F*** about the customers that come in. After 10 min of waiting to be sited,  we finally got a good spot. BUT after 5 minutes the waiter demanded us ( not asked) to move to another table because he wants to put a group over there of three people ( on table for 2) . I don't know about their food quality but the service is Horrible!! If you want a good service, good food go to Juliette et chocolate it is much better , and few steps away
What can i say - its crepes , chocolate , caramel & other good stuff. And this place has pizza deserts! WIN
A friend of mine mentioned that he came here a few times, on dates.This place does seem totally designed for dates, many items are for two :) and what's more romantic than chocolate?? When you walk in you will inevitably draw a comparison with Juliette and chocolat...Decor wise, this place seems more cosy and inviting. But menu and dessert wise it's on par with Juliette and chocolat.The menu is extensive, and it gave me a case of I don't know what I want-itis...What we ended up having was a banana split, NYC chocolate shake, and volcano, which is a brownie with a scoop of ice cream.The NYC shake, is not creamy, made with mostly ice, so good for those who are lactose intolerant, but then again a shake without cream or ice cream is in my opinion, a tragedy!!! but it was very chocolaty and less sweet.The banana split was the best thing we had. But ice cream, banana and chocolate sauce is hard to miss. The volcano was too sweet, the brownie was too sweet even though it had a lot of chocolate flavor. It was topped with a scoop of ice cream and drizzled with chocolate sauce, caramel, and strawberry sauce... too many sauces, and sugar over kill. Again, another nice concept in theory, but things didn't pan out as we had hoped. I do want to go back as there were some things I wanted to try out but could not since we were full coming here...My wish is to have something made with chocolate incorporated in it, some cake or something, not some dessert with chocolate sauce on it... it seems unimaginative, plus we have plenty of that at Juliette and chocolat, why can't we get something different?
Excellent service, free samples, versatile menu,. I love this place.They offer brunch, and lunch special crepes as well as tons of dessert options. I actually came in for lunch, not dessert with my bf and ordered the special crepe called Rosbif with roast beef, cheese, and mushrooms. Yum! Very delicious. It came with a salad and I wished I asked the waitress what the salad dressing was because it was so good. My bf ordered a waffle with semisweet chocolate sauce, and a salted crepe. His waffle was not too soft, not too hard....just the right texture. The semisweet chocolate tasted great, it melted in your mouth. That's when you know it's good quality chocolate.Waitress was very attentive and I enjoyed the free American style hot chocolate sample. I will definitely come back again and try more of the desserts and drinks. (I noticed there was a chocolate soda!!)
Stumbled across Cacao 70 on our way elsewhere and decided to try it. So glad we did! Thankfully we weren't too full from dinner, but even so a single parfait worked perfectly for two. We got one with chocolate-mint ice cream. I was a little worried when it arrived -- oftentimes green chocolate-mint ice cream is lower quality than white -- but it was great. It's two generous scoops of ice cream (and they happily gave us another bowl so it was easier to split) plus a whole slew of toppings. We really got a kick out of the options this provided. We dipped the fresh strawberries and the chocolate wafers in the hot fudge to create a mini fondue, as well as experimented with the various toppings in different combinations with the ice cream. The hazelnut "crunchy bits" were wonderful, and the brownie -- a very generous portion -- was excellent both plain and with the ice cream.  The missing star is for the price. This place ain't cheap. But it's definitely worth it as a special occasion place. And I suppose it's good for our waistlines that most of us can't afford to eat here regularly! Sadly we didn't get the hot chocolate samples other people got, but there are numerous varieties, including several types of cinnamon and/or chili hot chocolates that I can't wait to try. Discovering Cacao 70 is making me look forward to my next visit to Montreal even more.
The absolut  chocohilic meeting place! If you think you know everything about chocolate and how you can have it, think again!! Vast menu, more than 30 variety of chocolate, crepes, waffles...brunch, lunch, dinner, snacks...chocolate, chocolate, chocolate!!! Beautiful decor, cool ambiance, very good staff. Don't wait! Doctors say that chocolate is good for you, so...go and enjoy!
GREAT, superb chocolate and desserts!!You really should go here.Docked one star because I showed up with a group of 15 or so about twenty minutes before they closed down, and they told me 'sorry, we're closed,' and then agreed to serve us takeout only, and not the full menu.  There's nothing wrong with closing when it's time to close...it's just that some places would go above and beyond instead, being more concerned about earning 15 repeat customers.
Great Desert Place.Creeps don't compare to the Waffles
This is one of the best crepe places I've been to. The cappuccino is absolutely perfect. Not too strong not too weak. Creamy and smooth. Their crepes are always well cooked. Their service is great always quick. The staff is super nice and friendly.
The good news: The sandwich bread is delicious. The chocolate quality is, indeed,1st rate. The bad news: They got 1 of our 2 orders wrong and an order at the table next to ours. My chicken salad was so full of mustard flavour that I could barely finish it though I was famished and too much of the mesclun was rusted. Yet, when my friend asked for mustard for her supposed beef crepe she was told they had none. To boot the crepe had a super thin single layer of beef and almost none of the advertised mushrooms or cheese besides being too sweet to be called savoury. Our mugs of hot chocolate were so huge that we could not have finished them in a million years and the orange flavour advertised was no where to be seen. Service was impossibly slow but they appear to be understaffed and what staff there is appeared under-trained. Verdict: The bad outweighed the good too much for me to go back. There's better elsewhere.
Went here for brunch with my lady on a Sunday morning and it was fantastic. The café mocha was more like a bowl of delicious coffee chocolate love. Our waiter was attentive, polite, and really nice to talk to. While we waited for our crepes to be made they served up some delicious fresh fruits and some milky choco . The photo says it all!
We are completely hooked on Cacao 70s uniqueness since its opening, 2011. We go to Cacao 70 at least once a month usually to enjoy their divine hot chocolates and amazing crepes. Just love their crepes so much!
Best breakfast for anyone with a sweet tooth. Had waffles drizzled in dark and white chocolate. It's pretty hard not to overeat at this place!
Pure decadence!  Delicious chocolate.  A cornucopia of selection.  From the healthiest antioxidant packed cocoa to the sweetest desserts, this place has it all.  Huge menu.
I had the "The Breakfast" crepe and my wife had the "Feel Good About Yourself" crepe.  They were both excellent and authentic.  The hot chocolate was to die for.  I would recommend the Bolognese hot chocolate which had the faintest orange twist that was awesome.  We wanted to taste the chocolate fondue, but we were afraid that we might end up in a food coma.  We were able to get a table within about 10 minutes on a Saturday morning around 11:30 am.  Service was OK for how crowded the place was.
Nice little chocolate haven!! I think they can do better at highening the aroma of chocolate even more =PEnjoyed a little sexy chocolate drink in a margarita glass.... Soooo good!!
It's like Charlie going to the Chocolate Factory!  Yummy chocolate is oozing from practically everything!  Our waitress, Amy, is the awesomest!!!  Had the waffle--portion is just right.
OMG! I can believe this place exists! I could feel my blood sugar levels rising when i walk thru that entrance door! I could no believe all the chocolate i could try.  Its wonderful, good quality chocolate. The "restaurant" is big, open concept and very warm feeling. From Hot Chocolates to amazing desserts. Definite try!
Updated with our second Visit (4 days later - Read First Visit below if you haven't done so already)Second VisitThis visit we ordered a whole bunch of things:- Raspberry Brownie Parfait (again, but the first time was better as it came with chocolate cream)- Quadruple Chocolate Parfait- Triple Chocolate Pizza- Chocolate Nutella Ricotta Pizza- Chocolate Peanut Butter Pizza- Waffle with Ice Cream, Fruits and Chocolate- Raspberry Crepes with ChocolateYes, it was insane. The Pizzas were good but we ordered way too many and after a while you can only take so much. One slice per person is enough and I suggest getting something that isn't ONLY chocolate otherwise you go crazy (i.e. Quadruple Chocolate Parfait was good but near the end...). The waffle didn't taste like a waffle, it tasted like a sponge cake that was put into a waffle machine and I actually liked it better this way. As for crepes, it was good but a bit too soggy (too much jam on whatever the liquid was) for my taste. There are pics on my blog!First VisitAfter our visit to Kazu, which if you read about can tell that I was still super hungry (Satya actually cooked up a supper when we came back right after going to Kazu and Cacao 70!) we decided to try out the now chocolate place, Cacao70. I think it was a Presse Café before and the transformation into a chocolate bar was a good one. The place is aesthetically pleasing, well lit and makes you crave chocolate in every way. I am a huge chocolate lover and used to pound down tons of chocolate as a kid.We started off with some samples of hot chocolate. Despite the varying degrees of sweetness, I must say that the texture and taste of all the types were amazing.The Raspberry brownie parfait was great. The whipped cream was chocolatey and the ice cream went down really well with the brownies and raspberries. The triple chocolate cake was ok but the cake seemed to be more of a marble pound cake than a chocolate one. I haven't tried the chocolate pizza yet but it seems to look yummy. Maybe the next time I go.
A wide selection of everything chocolate you can think of! From brownies to fondue, from hot chocolate to cakes. We were a group and we ordered of bunch of stuff. Everything tasted wonderful and full of flavor. One of my friends described it like he hit a new high. Their hot chocolate was so thick, so it tasted like melted chocolate. The fondue was awesome with so many food combinations. The cheesecake tasted so good. On top of this, pricing was fair. Overall, a great place to sample some of the best chocolate desserts.
I had the "Illegal chocolate waffle" - Classic waffle drizzled with a 36% caramel chocolate sauce, milk chocolate shavings, served with caramelized bananas, crunchy chocolate wafer balls, chocolate sauce on the side and whipped cream. Now if that picture (shown in original post on my blog) above doesn't look like some sordid orgy of everything you know of breakfast, brunch, chocolate, and sin to be true and what you'd think the last room service order to Britney Spears' hotel room looks like before she shaved her head... then I don't know what does.
Every time I go I try something new - so far, I have never been disappointed. Spot on!
Clearly don't go here if you don't like chocolate.  We had the bitter selection for two.  Hot choc good..nice and bitter..fondue just enough..marshmallow toaster was fun, but also good for keeping warm.   What spoiled it was it the seats.  It's January, it's freezing in Montreal.. So being put at the,table that gets the blast of of arctic air whenever the next lot of customers feel the need to,keep both doors open as they try to get in.  Not a pleasant way to eat chocolate.. However the chic was great!  Get a proper porch!
I just love this place! It's beautiful, the food is incredible and the portions are big! My new chocolate place! :)
OMG...This place is amazing.  The chocolate is transcendent.  I would just drink the melted fondue chocolate by itself.  I had the choc-nut waffle.  The hazelnuts on it was delicious, beautifully displayed, nevermind the melted chocolate being delicious.There was a wait on a Saturday night, but well worth it.
The fondue was a good portion for the price and really good, although some things look a bit expensive for what they're offering other things look like unique offerings. I personally would not spend ten bucks on drinking chocolate. The service was a mix of competence and incompetence depending on the employee.
We stopped here for dessert to take to-go. Being a chocoholic, I found it very hard to decide on what to order because everything sounded appealing. The server was so helpful and strongly recommended the chocolate cake. I am SO glad he did. (Do NOT be deceived, this is not your average chocolate cake!) It came in a cup (maybe bc we ordered it to-go), and it took all our strength to wait till we got to our hotel to eat it. It was HEAVENLY! Layers of mousse, cake, dark chocolate syrup (that was CREAMY), and other things I couldn't quite identify. The texture came together and just melted in your mouth, though the distinct flavors truly spoke for itself. How can something taste so light and yet so rich?! I couldn't stop thinking about that dessert for the rest of the day. A bit steep on the wallet for a cup of cake ($11ish after tax), but boy, it was definitely worth it! Would not recommend sharing! Preserve your relationship and buy your own! ;)
Whenever I'm studying, I love ordering from here as they have awesome food. It's a bonus that they have several gluten-free options - very accommodating for those with allergies.Their menu is super detailed and you know exactly what ingredients every dish includes. The portions are perfect, and the prices are super reasonable. Two doors north of the store they even have another store where they sell some of their dishes/ desserts as well as several other vegan things. The only downside was that the service was a little bit slow, but the food definitely made up for it. I would 100% recommend Aux Vivres!
The sandwich are okay, the portions are really big though. The tempeh was really good, especially the sauce coming with it. Planning on going back to taste other stuffs on their menuI was really impressed by the gateau fauxmage A MUST seriously. The staffs are really friendly
Meh, try once kinda place. I love vegetarian food and all but just wasn't feeling this place you know? We came right when they were open so maybe the kitchen wasn't ready yet so my sandwich took awhile to come out. I saw the BLT sandwich on Yelp and it looks so good. They saw us struggling reading French so they finally gave us an English menu. They should just always leave out English menu! |BLT sandwich| 11.25 CAD About $8 US money for a sandwich is not bad considering it's vegetarian. So they replaced the bacon with coconut pieces that had a lot of flavor on its own but too dry for a sandwich. We bought a small box of it on the side for our road trip and it tastes better as a snack. What its lacking was the sauce. It was too dry with all 3 ingredients: coconut pieces, lettuce, tomatoes. I'm glad I shared and only had half of it. Could barely make it through.
If you're looking for delicious and affordable vegan cuisine, this is my number one pick in the city. They recently expanded, due to the constant flow of people, which has really helped minimize lineups. The food is fantastic and offers a mix of Indian, Greek, Thai, Mexican and other inspired flavours - but all with the Aux Vivres twist. My usuals here are the curry lentil soup, the Thai & Dragon bowls with tempeh, the Thai choupati wrap and of course one of their fabulous desserts, notably the GF banana-chocolate torte or the apple-chocolate cake. Yum!
it was my first time at any vegan restaurant and it was a great experience. even though I am a meat lover , the bowl I took (dragon bowl) had great flavors and taste. It was pretty big and filling , I had trouble finishing it
Vegan comfort food with great deserts and a liquor license.Prompt service regardless of how busy it is. Delicious smoothies- particularly the chocolate one and the blue monkey. Big portions- awesome for lunches.
​​I've never been to a completely vegan establishment before since I'm an omnivore, but a friend of ours suggested us this place while we were visiting and I thought, why not.Can't explain how surprised I was ​by the deliciousness of things. We only came for coffee ​and a dessert, but still. Maybe if we return some day I'll order a main dish as well (or just a ton of desserts), but for now...... the desserts were amazingly good (not cheap though, keep that in mind). I had the Gâteau Faux-Mage. Heavenly! Seriously​!​ It was waaaaay better than a typical cheesecake you can order anywhere else.​ I'd kill to have the recipe and be able to ​make it at home ​myself ​over and over.Husband ordered Apple Pie which was great as well, but the Uncheesecake got me so bad I hardly wanted to try his dessert. :)Coffee came with almond milk and so did my Earl Grey tea. Both great.This place has very friendly staff. They speak English and menu has two sides - French and English. What ​​more could one want? I'd give them 10 stars if I could. :)​
Generous portion, reasonable price and fresh ingredients. I had the buddha bowl (with tofu), which came in a large colorful bowl of veggies and rice.My only small complaint is that I wish he proportion of rice to veggies was more equal, as there was way too much rice and not enough veggies to balance it. However, the sauce was very good and complemented the meal well.   The price point was very reasonable. $11 for the sandwiches and $13-15 for the bowls. I wish i had the room to try their desserts as they looked so so good. Will definitely return to try the sandwiches and chocolate desserts !   P.S. Their menu is extremely extensive, so great place for non-vegan/vegetarians as well.
Always busy...even on Monday nights!A sign that there is not enough vegan restaurant in Montreal...Vegan fares that will make you come back for more...not all dishes are a hit in my opinion but some are highly addictive! Try the pate samples with chapati or the dragon bowl.The vege lox is quite surprising, it does really taste like smoke salmon! Delicious smoothies and fresh juices! Friendly service. That's all you need to know!
I'm not a vegetarian but I enjoyed my meal here. I had waffles for brunch. Wasn't crazy about the soy "bacon" but the rest was really good. Haven't been back in a while but would recommend even if you aren't vegan.
Good vegan food! I am happy there is an all vegan restaurant in Montreal. Au Vivre has a good size menu, the huevos rancheros for the weekend brunch menu are so good. Good coffee as well and great combinations for fresh juices, the popeye is green power and delicious.  They also offer cakes and desserts, I am excited to try some f those.The restaurant itself has a diner feeling to it.  Nothing special.  The service is good and fast.Prices are reasonable.  Overall, a good vegan option!
Staff are calm, attentive and not over bearing. Food was fast but it was just a salad so cannot judge. The Dragon Salad was delicious! $12. Brown rice was tasty and a good soy and sesame vinaigrette but I was left a little hungry ( just a bit more vegetables) and the grilled tofu could of been marinated for flavour or seasoned and cooked more than the mere scorch line it bore.Overall a great spot for a Sunday light supper that seems to attract all ilk.
Came here for brunch on the weekend, which was busy. I got the yogurt with granola. It was my first time trying nondairy yogurt, and it was actually really good. I would definitely go for one of the veggie bowls next time, which was what my friend got and it looked so good. I also got a mango smoothie; I was hoping that the smoothie was thicker though.
I've been to Aux Vivres more times than its worth counting for over the years. That being said, I've seen this place change somewhat radically in terms of atmosphere, food and service, which makes it all the harder to review. At another time I could count on a quality Mekong sandwich large enough to be shared between two broke folks- now I find the lunch and dinner quantities underwhelming and the sauce overbearing. Definitely not the kind of meal to be shared. This is also accompanied by a different atmosphere- it's not the intimate little vegan nook it once was.I wouldn't recommend visiting the joint for anything other than brunch- which is the only legit. vegan brunch I can really vouch for in the city (check out that perfectly cooked polenta!).
Pretty decent vegan place that I frequent when I am in the plateau/mile end area. The portions sizes are decent and the prices are pretty cheap. When the food is good, it's really good, when it's bad, it's downright awful. Good : The Sirocco wrap, if you get in the take out section is only $5.49. The Dragon sauce is probably the best to compliment that wrap. The 'cheese' scone and 'un-cheese' cakes are probably my personal favorites and I would go out of my way to get those. The Mezze Mediterranean w/ Chapati will not disappoint either!  Bad : Avoid brunch if possible, the blueberry crepes are really dry. The chili fries were a bit cold...and dry. Not impressed with their portobello burger either. There's not much flavour in the tofu, I think it's grilled without seasoning. Bottom Line : I have my favorites, but this is not the place to be adventurous because most stuff are pretty bland without the sauces or just really dry. However, it's still my go to place for cheap vegan foods.
Get the dragon bowl! I got a burger when I came here (which is not bad), but when I took a little sample of my friend's dragon bowl...oh the regret! Definitely coming back here to devour the whole thing myself. The decor here is simple and clean. The waitress who served us was very helpful in giving us recommendations and we had a nice little chat about that secret sauce in that dragon bowl too. I heard their smoothies are pretty awesome, so there's another thing to add to my "to try" list.
I find this place overrated !!! Their food isn't that much big of a deal. That being said, i like the concept of a whole, vegan and healthy food joint.The place was jam packed. Im glad that the service was really quick and friendly. The waiters are so patient and helpful. They explain the menu and try to guide you along side. For starters, i got the smoked coconut. It was really small but very delicious.  I had the Buddha bowl for the main dish and I was very disappointed :/ My rice was bland and overcooked. The veggies were suppose to be steamed as indicated. Yet some  were just raw and unappetizing. The only steamed veggie in the bowl was the spinach. The bowl was filling so I'm glad about that. It looks really small but very filling. If you're not vegetarian or vegan, don't waste your time here it's not food that can be savoured. I'm a foodie and for me it did not satisfy my palate.It was weird on my stomach, i won't lie. The ambiance is very hipster and raww not classy at all.
One of the most legit vegan restaurants I've ever been to, period! And I've been to many! The bowls are fan.fucking.tastic. And I'm an unapologetic omni. I could turn veg if I had access to this place on a regular basis. I love bowls with raw veg in them for some reason and they make it so, so, so, good and not like some cheap imitation of omni food.
One of the best places to eat in Montreal. Maybe Anthony Bourdain considers skipping Joe Beef next time he's in town and trying this place instead to test his anti-vegan views --- dude, the food here is really good! Some of best brunch and lunch food in Montreal. Just happens to be vegan. If you still just want steak, at least come for the dessert. There is no reasonable emotional objection to at least trying a vegan dessert.
Let me start by saying that I'm a meat lover, which is the reason I can't give this restaurant 5 stars. Having said that, this place is sublime...they're food is absolutely delicious!A friend and I arrived a bit before 1pm on good Friday and the place was full, but they gave us a table within a few minutes. As the meat lover I am, I had a hard time navigating the menu so I asked the waitress for help and she helped me very diligently. My friend got the Dragon Bowl with tempeh and I got the Buddha Bowl with tempeh...I didn't even know what tempeh was! Food arrived and we devoured it, and I can stress how surprised vegan food can be so good! For dessert we even shared an "uncheesecake" (in French the pun was better, at "gateau au faux-mage") and however they make it, it tasted exactly like cheesecake. In the end, my friend and I each spent about $20.If you're a carnivore and you're looking for a small break from meat, or your date likes vegetarian/vegetalian food, this place will be appropriate!
Ok, I'm addicted to the Vege Pate.I had to run over to their take-out shop next door and buy some for home.Aux Vivres was one of the best meals I had in Montreal.Everything is vegan and perfectly executed.I had the dragon bowl because I wanted to try this dragon sauce that  I have heard so much about.  It was creamy, nutty, rich, and soooo good.The bowl was so big I couldn't finish it!  Beets, carrot, red cabbage, daikon, lettuce,sprouts, and in-house made tempeh ($13.50).As for fresh juices, the Popeye (5.95/7.50) was a magical spicy blend of cucumber, celery, apple, lemon, cayenne pepper.I'm totally coming back here next time I'm in town!
This was sooo yummy! I had the blueberry pancakes and my boyfriend had the huevos rancheros. The service was lovely and our waitress was super sweet and nice. The place was clean and so were the restrooms. This was our first time in Canada and I was so happy to find various vegan food places. I'm vegan and my boyfriend is vegetarian. I definitely want to come back here and try more of their food, I highly recommend it!
Spent a year traveling weekly to montreal for work - aux vivres was my go to spot. I'd eat here at least 2 meals a week - i got to try most of their menu! Love everything ! Tons of flavour and variety - from heavy to light meals, lunch and dinner, there is something to suit your mood. Yummy desserts and great loose leaf tea selection too. Reminds me of 'Fresh' in Toronto - similar vibe, menu and style.
I had been wanting to go to Aux Vivres for years, and after the build-up, the disappointment seemed inevitable. Now, I don't like either rice or tempeh, of course being a vegan establishment, most of their menu is based on both. Sadface!I wanted to maximize the variety of food and eat something warm, so I ordered the cornbread, a small chilli bowl, a creamsicle smoothie and a side of coconut bacon. The cornbread is not really an appetizer, it's massive, 4 sticks of bread + sauce! Umf. It's surprisingly sweet, with peppers baked in. Not at all what I expected since I come from a garlic cornbread background. The chilli was good, but not remarkable. Now the side of vegan bacon is pretty massive. Delicious, crispy, actually close to bacon in flavour, but sooo salty! I'd actually recommend not ordering it at your table and instead buying it at their store, it's a lot cheaper. The smoothie was the highlight of my meal, and made a fantastic dessert: the taste is exactly that of an orange creamsicle, but with only vegan goodness inside.The space is beautiful, and surprisingly homey, that being said, my waitress was surly and oddly avoidant. Minus points! I left ridiculously full, and a bit miffed. They do seem to have delicious desserts, so I guess that'd be a nice occasion to change my mind..
Was my first time at a vegan restaurant and I was pleasantly suprised. Food was really good. Had some tofu scrambled eggs as part of my breakfast and taste was great. Only downside is that you don't have free refills of the coffee, which some people  I went with were disappointed but since I don't drink coffee I did not mind.
My husband and I were visiting from Toronto and paid this place a visit. The restaurant is huge and the service was so fast, we were shocked. Our burger and salad came in less than five minutes!However, it made sense when the food arrived. It's canteen-type prepared food that was put together in a minute presented under the guise of gourmet vegan fare. It was still a big healthy meal that was fresh enough but lacking vibrancy. The flavours were there but nothing really blew us away, like there was a special touch missing.
Came here end of August with my surprisingly open-minded father (furthest thing from vegan)! I loved it. I got the Thai bowl with tofu which was served with a delicious peanut sauce and brown rice. My dad tried the Tempeh satay sticks with peanut sauce and the cornbread with veggie butter and guacamole. He loved the cornbread, not so much the tempeh (but I think as a meat eater he might have been put off)! Overall I loved it! And I'll be back :)
I went to Aux Vivres with my parents (who are vegan) and we weren't too impressed. The dishes had exotic flavors which I appreciated, but I didn't leave satisfied at all.We had the dragon bowl, the buddha bowl with tempeh and the coconut blt wrap. All were okay. I probably wouldn't go back.
This place has almost a cult following for its coconut bacon alone, but the rest of the food selections are equally rich in character, and delicious. I've been here a couple of times and always leave stuffed and completely satisfied. It's decently affordable, too. The juices will give you *super powers* (just kidding, but it feels like that when you drink it), the servings are really substantial and there's excellent selection, whether you're vegan or not. I've gotten chana paratha, which is an entree but was plenty enough eats for me, along with a juice (although I wasn't starving when I got there). I've also gotten the Assiette Mumbai, which was simple fare, and also really tasty and satisfying - seems I have a thing for chickpeas. Next time I go, I'm trying their famed Dragon Bowl. Honestly, you can't go wrong here. The staff is sparkling, there's a ton of seating and you're being good to your body with every bite.
Great food here! There were so many good looking options, which did make making a decision hard. We got the Bombay smoothie which had masala in it, yum! We also got the spread platter served with chapati, probably my favorite. We ended the meal with the Thai peanut bowl, which was also very fresh, yet hearty. Servings are large so you get quite full even though ingredients are plant based.We went on a Monday during the lunch hour and they were so busy the servers were literally almost running around. The service was slower than what you would expect, but it was fine given we're on vacation.
Being able to get a healthy dinner at 10 in the evening - priceless. I go to this place whenever I am in Montreal for business and I always come for a late dinner. (Never been there before 9pm)The staff is friendly, the food is great. I always try the soup of the day and know all the items on the menu by now. Also, the quantities of food are large, I simply love it.
I am not a vegan, but I still enjoy this place. Never ate in but ordered out a few times. I go pretty often to their little grocery store next to the restaurant. The prepared pita wraps are good... Some very good. Steer away from the scirocco... The taste is ok but the condiments wet the pita making for a very mushy sandwich.The desserts are decent. The salads are great. The guacamole is particularly good.Where it felt short: the famous BLT. The first bites are good, but it is SO sweet, you will be unable to finish it. Same problem with the cornbread and the peanut sauce. Too sweet!Why only 2 stars: they charge 34.99$ for a regular apple pie! I never complain on price, but that is unacceptable.
great place you walk out feeling UNGUILTY about eating ofcourse the sauces r fat but so what
This was the first vegan restaurant in Montreal and I was super surprised to learn that it was the best food I tried during my weekend visit there! It has not only provided an example for other health/compassionate establishments, but it has kept up the pace as more competition appears in the vegan resto realm. Service was fabulous. Huge portions with beautifully displayed meals, a late brunch (score!), lots of protein (tempeh!) options, and delicious, DELICIOUS ingredients and bites. I wanted to eat here every day (and almost did). There are lots of options including juices, big salads, veggie bowls, and more. I had the blueberry pancakes and it even came with a chai latte. If you are vegan, or even open-minded, you MUST go here - you will not be disappointed.
Oh I wanted so badly to give this place five stars! The food was magical. It was the best carrot cake of my life, no question. But the server did not check in, except to order our dessert, and did not even bring a water refill once, not even when I asked for one. Otherwise a wonderful dining experience. The latke burger is crazy good!
I'm a fan of the food you can order at the express counter. Their dragon sauce is an all time favourite. We can't stop eating their sushi, sandwiches, dragon bowls. Healthy and nutritive.
Very good food, and smoothies! The pancakes for brunch and bowls for dinner are amazing! Deserts and especially cheese cake are awesome!
I do not care if you are vegan, vegetarian, carnivore or omnivore, but you have to try this restaurant out!I came here on a Saturday night with my girl and here's how it went:Pros:- Extremely friendly staff, smiles on everyone's faces- No wait or minimal wait to get seated- Fast service (Saturday night from appy to dessert took us only 45 minutes)- Delicious smoothies! I had a Bombay Banana smoothie and miss awesome had a zesty lime-celeri smoothie (forgot name). They were made on spot and were refreshing!- Generous portions: had us rolling after we were done- Food? YUM. We had the large Chili and a Mekong sandwich and we couldn't finish them all. But we saved space for a choco-banana cake! Cons:- Price-wise is alright but not too shabby!- Mekong's peanut butter sauce was a bit on the sweet side, but not that bad!Extras:I am actually omnivore but I really enjoyed it! I will definitely return. Thank you Aux Vivres for being vegan-friendly.
Delicious food and a great atmosphere. Additional pre-made items in the refrigerator make this a great stop for lunch and snacks to get you to your next destination hanger (hungry anger) free. Had the seitan gyro and a can of Yerba mate tea. it was filling and delicious. No regrets.
Also so good, healthky, full of colors, and so delicious! Always have tontake the dragon bowl (12$) worth alll the penny. The restaurant is now twice space as it was.Veryconfortable, sunny seats and banquette.No wifiAlso the boutique allows us to bring back good food at jome. All vegan, all flavourful - so many things to try.The cakes can be brought home for a birthday or party.The smoothie has a perfect snack.But try to take away just one thing. Everything is so appealing
Alright. I found it. The best vegetarian restaurant in Montreal (and believe me, I've spent a lot of time and money searching).We had the sampler plate of spreads, served with warm chapati. We were blown away by the beauty and creativity of it. Tofu cream? How cute! Olive tapenade - mindblowingly delicious. We promised ourselves we'd eat lightly - but everything disappeared! Who stole the chapati? We couldn't have eaten all that?! Ok, ok, fine. We just had to.My dragon bowl is what I wish every meal could be. Warm, filling, delicious, and exciting. Hello, delicious, incredibly unique and inimitable sauce! Where did you come from? Can I marry you? Why is my friend kissing her BLT? Does she want to marry it too?There's also great music playing and a great, brightly-lit atmosphere. Waiters are all warm and attentive. The desserts make symphonies resound in your head for hours.Next time I'm bringing my sleeping bag and never leaving.
This place is amazing. We could hardly believe everything was vegan. We're pretty sure the food is made out of angel livers and unicorn poop.Particularly mind-blowing: The carrot soup and the brownie with nuts.Guys, please open a restaurant in San Francisco!
Outstanding food, sensational service, and superb company made this a place to remember.  The staff is friendly, efficient, and generous with the coffee, and even the most finicky eater will find a favourite here. I had a Bombay banane smoothie to start, with sweet dates and spicy ginseng blended with cream soy coconut milk.  Indulgent yet light, and the perfect accompaniment to a generous portion of chick pea curry that I inhaled whilst awaiting my friends.  The curry was savoury and nourishing, and could easily satisfy a lunch time craving by itself.  I had a Bouddha bowl for my entrée, and it was more than I could eat even if I'd begun on an empty stomach, so yay for leftovers!  The vegetables were perfectly steamed and crisp, with an excellent Japanese sauce that blended well with the fresh veggies and brown rice as well.  My friends shared a stunning cornbread starter with vegan butter, and fresh green salad, and BLT that quite honestly made me wish I'd heeded their advice. Arriving on a fresh chapati, the layers of juicy tomatoes, verdant lettuce, vegan mayonnaise, and coconut bacon, had me transfixed on what I could only imagine to be the best tasting vegan sandwich ever.  My friends seemed to know, yet didn't offer even a single bite.  Well played.
This post will be like most other on here, I'm going to sing the praises of the aux vivres BLT, it's simply the best sandwich I've ever had. I will say that I have almost perfect this sandwich myself all that's off is the chapatti bread, I can't seem to make it the same way. The coconut bacon, has a smokey, sweet and salty flavour, as well as a slightly greasy aspect to it because of the fat in coconut. The secret to that sandwich is the vegan butter sauce that they spread on the chapatti before applying the vegan mayo, Bacon, lettuce and tomato.  I've also tried there new breakfast burrito, it's great, a generous portion plus a coffee or tea for 5$. Other items I've had include, the portobello burger, the channa wrap, veggie lox, the veggie pate, chilli, faux cheese cake, choco banana pie, many smoothies and fresh juices.  I've been here 20+ times in the past 3-4 years, I've never had a bad meal, the only thing I hate about going to aux vivres is when my meal comes to an end, I just never want to leave. I've been a vegetarian for about 8 years and   I'm trying to be a vegan, this restaurant makes it that much easier.
Aux Vivres is a perfect take-out option and also a great spot for a quick, affordable and different meal ! I absolutely love their Dragon Bowl but many other great options are yours to discover ; fresh juice, vegan chili and BLT sandwich wrap (made with coconut bacon) will please even the strongest meat lovers !
I have never been to the restaurant itself as me and my roommate have only been ordering online, but I cannot wait to find the time to actually go there. We have a bad habit of ordering food when we're tired instead of cooking (really, ask our banker, he's not very happy with us right now) but we are still trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle. We were very happy to find Aux Vivres and it has become our undisputed food provider for lazy days, and for others too. We are both vegan and it can sometimes be tricky to find good, fresh and healthy food for a reasonable price. Now I won't say Aux Vivres is cheap, but the food is worth the price, and we have not been disappointed once. Not once! And we've tried a lot of different things, from their burgers to their sandwiches, their specialties to their desserts, and even their brunch! (You can tell we have a lot of "lazy days", I'm not even ashamed)I have to say, one of the best thing about Aux Vivres is that even if it is considered a "trendy" place, your grandmother would still approve of the portions (you know, the one who keeps saying that you need to "put some meat on those bones")! I had a hard time finishing the sandwich in one sitting, and you can be sure that every single item on the menu will probably fill you up! (One thing to remember when you want to order dessert, take something on the lighter side before! And no, not the sandwich!)We would recommend the Chili Fries, the Vege Burger and their brownies, especially for non-vegans eating there! Otherwise, everything else is absolutely delicious and it mostly depends on your personal tastes!
Super cute vegan diner with ample amount of choice! I had the Thai bowl, but it was a little underwhelming compared to some of the rice bowls I've had at places in Toronto, like Fresh. The flavours were a little bland and nothing really stood out. However, it did taste okay and it was a good, sizeable portion. My friend got the sirocco chipati and it was massive! It's definitely an item you can share amongst two if you aren't extremely hungry. Overall the service was great, the staff really knew the menu items like the back of their hand. I only wish the food was slightly more flavourful!
I am by no means vegetarian or vegan but I really enjoyed this place. I had the dragon bowl. The sauce was soooo great! Meal wasn't too expensive and I even had the "Gateaux au Faux-mage" or Uncheesecake. Very good food :)
Service was really fast which is great! We came on a very rainy Tuesday afternoon.We ordered a small salad for $6. It was tiny but the dressing was really great! The small indian soup was also excellent. We ordered the kosmos dish and it was OK.. However, the setian tasted strange and I'm generally a fan of tofu.The carrot cake was also OK.. a little dry.Since I frequent these vegan/veggie places often, I know what is good and what should be charged for what I get. The food is a solid 4 stars, service is a 5, but I'll give it a 4 since it's so expensive I feel like that should merit small ding.
We had the dragon and Buddha bowls. They were very good but as other reviewers have mentioned, rely on sauces instead of more flavorful ingredients. No kids menu.  Fried potatoes were dry.
Love it here! Polenta brunch with beans and tofu scramble. The guacamole is awesome.  Vegan brunch goodness galore!
We went on a Friday night and thanks to their renovation and added tables, there was virtually no wait time to be seated. The menu offers a fair amount of options-- I might even say too many, as some of the salads and bowls really have only one omition or addiction of ingredients separating them, making it somewhat redundant.I'm vegan and it really seemed as though the two non-vegans who dined with me were more keen on the food than I was. My perception of Aux Vivres is that it's basically another trendy, Plateau hipster haunt that's geared towards capitalising on the vegan craze, targeting non-vegans more than vegans themselves.I don't tend to cook with tons of seitan, TVP, tofu, tempeh, etc., nor do many other vegans I know, and yet most of their meals are laden with them. Fresh produce and inventive use of veggies (plus a chia seed there or a nut here) are more than enough to create an appetizing vegan meal. My veggie burger and fries were extremely, extremely heavy. The fries were more like soft slabs of potato than crispy French fries.My two friends split a bowl (Dragon, I believe) and a BLT. The BLT was drenched in sauce and wasn't a taste I particularly enjoyed from the bite I had. I won't hurry back to the restaurant despite its relatively good service due to its overhyped, overpriced and under spiced food.
Great food if you're looking for mostly fast food vegan. They offer a variety of options, everyone is sure to be satisfied and not left hungry. Meat lovers approve!
that monstrous BLT with the coconut bacon!i really have nothing else to say. that faux bacon speaks for itself. its so good, i've recreate that recipe at home and i eat it like chips or sprinkle it everywhere like fairy dust!service takes a while especially if there's a lineup, even for takeout. price is a bit on the pricey side but its still good enough to warrant many visits.never done a sit down meal but i should next time, they really play some good 80s-90s classics. that's a winner already right there and with the diner vibe, how can one go wrong?
Stumbled upon this gem after a road-race - absolutely delicious!!!
Yum! Great food. Reasonable prices. Long hours. Need anything else? My two favorite dishes are the pancakes and the lasagna (take out only). So tasty!
Great vegan joint! The place is clean, service is fast and friendly. In terms of a vegan restaurant they might lack diversity or "originality" in cuisine but the food is great, portions are healthy and the price is worth it!
Stop whatever you are doing and go here. Now. Vegan or not, the food is amazing. If you don't like sweet main dishes (and I don't) avoid the dishes with the Thai peanut sauce. I found them to be horrendously sweet. However, the dragon bowl is on a higher plane of existence. I hate beets but loved them in here. The tempeh burger is so good that I actually enjoyed the Taste and texture of it. I really don't like tempeh. The chili is warming and comforting. Avoid the chili fries. The potatoes are cut too large for it to work well. However the chili and corn nachos is worth it. The blt with coconut bacon is refreshing and not as weird as it sounds. I've never et bacon before, so I have no frame of reference but as a sandwich the dish is a solid win. Cheesecake is dense and rich. Carrot cake is loaded with big flavour. The mango lassi is creamy and tart but not too much like a yoghurt drink as I recall lassi to be. Still tasty in its own right. The creamsicle smoothie is exactly what it says it is. Waitstaff are extremely friendly, and attractive. Decor is a little like a diner but still nice looking. Prices are reasonable for the mountains of food you're getting. Sandwiches are served on chapati and not bread so they are easier to pick up and eat. Not at all messy. Great place to bring a date. Just get one appetiser, one main, and one dessert to share and you'll both be pleasantly full. This restaurant has  its act together.
Still one of the best vegan joints in town; special brunch options on weekends, though they recently changed the brunch menu and added heuvos rancheros and replaced their awesome waffles with moderately okay pancakes.If you're going for weekend brunch make sure to go early, massive lineups after 12:30 (parking is free before 1pm also)
Excellent vegan food. Fantastic menu! Generous portions. Can't go wrong...especially when you live a three minute walk away like I do! They have a diverse menu. Smoothies and juices, comfort food, salads, sandwiches, bowls, burgers, cornbread, chilli, and deserts. They also have brunch on the weekends which I have yet to try but it looks really tasty! The Mexicali Plate is very satisfying for a chilly day and completely filling! It is house chili, brown rice, guacamole, sour cream, tortillas, and a side salad. It is one of my favorite things on the menu! The chili is so delicious you won't miss the meat! Another favourite is the Dragon bowl or the Dragon sandwich. The sandwich is very big and served in chipati which is so tasty! It is stuffed with goodness: tofu, beets, carrots, red cabbage, daikon, lettuce, sprouts, and their special 'dragon sauce'. The bowl is essentially the same thing as the sandwich, but in a bowl served on brown rice. They also offer tempeh for an additional cost. My absolute favourite desert there leaves me so happy that I get it every time and I haven't ordered any other deserts because I don't know if they will be as good as this: the chipotle brownie. It is huge! I think it is $4.25 but totally worth it. It is a chocolate delight! I can't wait to try more of their menu! They also offer take out but you order it in the store entrance rather than the restaurant. They have a nice little bar you can eat at in there and it has much more of a coffee shop feel than the restaurant.
I don't eat here very often because my boyfriend is allergic to soy and nuts (I know, I know -- poor me :( ) BUT when I do come to Aux Vivres I milk it for what it's worth. First, what I like about Aux Vivres is that the staff is always very welcoming and friendly, the establishment is always clean, and they have booths (a.k.a privacy). You always see a mixture of people from stay-at-home moms in Lululemons, hipsters, tourists, yogis, business people that work in the hood, etc. so it's wonderful for people watching while you're waiting for your meal (in the privacy of your booth, obviously...)Recommended dishes (and drinks): Bombay Banane smoothie (I swear that I hear the voice of angels singing when this drink is brought to me), corn bread and the Dragon Bowl with tempeh (mmm..).The brunch is always solid -- le complet is delicious - to reduce the soy intake, I like to have palenta rather than scrambled tofu for an additional 2$ - and the pancakes are tasty and filling (order with appetite).Also! According to my friends who love Aux Vivres as much as I do, the BLT sandwich and the carrot cake come STRONGLY recommended for all you fat vegans/vegetarians/omnivores out there. My only complaint about Aux Vivres is that it's always busy and you may have to wait for seating ;) Enjoy!
Holy giant/cheap/delicious vegan sandwiches, batman! This is a must-do when I'm in Montreal and anyone who joins me adds it to their must-do list as well. We were on a tight schedule so we did a call-ahead order. Hmm... there are going to be 5-7 of us eating, so maybe we'll get six sandwiches? After all, they're only about $10 each.We picked up our order and started unpacking the sandwiches. I thought I was cutting them in half, but really I was slicing each half into a quarter. These are like giant burrito sandwiches (I would call them wraps), and one is easily enough for two (hungry) people. As you may have guessed, six sandwiches was about twice as much as we actually needed. But it worked out, because we wrapped up the remainders and saved it for dinner to-go the next day. Every item was tasty, but stop everything and get the BLT. Flaky and tender smoked coconut ("bacon"), lettuce, tomato, and vegan mayonnaise. We have smoked coconut at a place here in Rochester, but this is easily superior. It has the meaty texture of coconut, the smokiness of bacon, but still a strong sweet coconut flavor. Get your hungry tummy over to Aux Vivres and fill it up right.
I've been going here since 2009 - this place goes from strength to strength. Expanding continuously, getting better food and more acceptable ways for pick-up. Sold! It's great. More please!
I guess this place needs no more PR, but we really had a great experience here.Awesome curious menu with so much variety to choose from. All vegan, all specially made and unique enough to warrant trying. I am not vegan and it all looked really appetizing. Not bad prices either.Got their with gf about 5pm on a Saturday. Super nice server, which surprised me as I expected passive aggressive judgmental vegans, to a degree. Ordered lentil soup, veggie pate. Both were just awesome. I had a burger, and gf had the BLT. BLT is huge, but as close and amazing to a real BLT I had ever tasted. Really good. And my burger was really good too. Though it left me with that full vegan burger feeling for a while after. We also had two Kombuchas.Everything tasted really unique and GOOD. I'm not vegan, but if I could figure out how to cook like that, then shit I'd probably give up meat in no time. Really great stuff. Had a great experience and will definitely go back.
I'm so in love with this restaurant! Their menu is diversify and everything is good. I already taste the dragon wrap and the deluxe salad both are delicious. Even if you aren't vegetarians you will love it.
One of my favourite Vegan places to eat in Montreal! The absolute best is the Dragon Bowl - it will become an addiction!
We are in town from Virginia for a few nights, traveling with our 3 kids, ages 12, 9, and 4. My husband and I are vegetarians, but our kids love meat whenever possible. We decided upon this cute little vegan spot based on reviews and proximity to our VRBO condo. It didn't disappoint. We ordered gyro, Portabello burger, a Thai tofu bowl special, chili, cornbread, and humus. Ingredients were fresh. Portions huge. Nobody left hungry, but we all felt healthy. Our 9 year old couldn't believe there was no meat in his chili (and he loved it!)Highly recommended for healthy, tasty, family-friendly meal.
Came here for a lunch on a Sunday around 11:30am- surprisingly no major line up!We ate:- Mexicali plate (3/5): the guac was awesome, but the chilli was cold and lacking the wow factor. A+ tortilla!- Portobelo mushroom burger (3/5): While the mushroom itself was delish, the toppings and potatoes left more to be desired.- Fresh apple juice : (4/5) umm 6$?Overall it was okay,  but I could find these dishes at other non-speciality Restos and it would be probably better. Ps. Upon leaving at 1ish there was a crazy line!!!
Finally made it to Aux Vivres after hearing the hype for many years...and it does live up to its reputation. There were about 7 choices on the menu that could have been my #1 choice but I went with the chili fries with sour "cream" ... tasted like the real thing but no bad side effects from dairy afterward. A big win in my books. I hope they'll start stocking their sour cream in the store soon so I can bring some home and have it with pierogies.Serving sizes were pretty large so if you have an appy or a juice, you might have to take home half your roti sandwich for lunch the next day. The food came very quickly and our server was very pleasant.Next visit: dragon bowl or buddha bowl, creamsicle smoothie, maybe the potato/chickpea curry roti or "lox" sandwich... Oh, man. There are going to have to be many next visits to fit all these in to my belly!
Astonishingly great!! The Dragon sauce with Dragon Tempeh bowl is so fresh & fantastic! I do enjoy a good steak once in a while but this food will make you feel like your glowing from the inside. Delicious!!
This is an EXCELLENT vegan restaurant. I'm a huge meat fan but I know it isn't good for me or the environment, but I can't help loving what I love (mmkay?)I came here, ate the dragon bowl and LOVED IT. It was so delicious, satisfying and not at all "vegan" which you would think would not fill you up but it was so good. I am definitely re-energized to become a vegan / vegetarian again. That dragon sauce is killer. Delicious. DELICIOUS. I want to eat everything on the menu now.
So a few years have passed and I think it's time for an update! Food, as usual, is delicious. Lots and lots of fresh veggies. Good flavours. Lots of choice. And service is excellent! Not sure if its the newfangled tablets the servers use to take orders, but everything went a lot more smoothly and quickly than in the past. And our waitress was so kind, checking in with us on a regular basis, and even chatting a bit about our days.
Excellent vegan restaurant and my favourite!! I eat there regularly and everything is always fresh and delicious..very generous portions as well!!
The food was delicious and the service was excellent. I'll eat here again the next time I'm in Montreal.
What a great restaurant! The asian inspired bowls are better than anything you can find in china town. Fresh veggies with amazing homemade sauces and great presentation make this a visual delight as well as mouthwatering, delicious, and healthy. The food is filling and satisfying. My daughter always orders the greek platter. Best tzatziki ever.Then there are the vegan desserts. Fantastic!This restaurant is all around amazing.Decor is cute, staff is attentive, and location is prime.If you're in Montreal Au Vivre is a must!
Aux Vivres is one of the few vegan/vegetarian restaurants in Montreal and is located on St. Laurent. It's a great option if you're looking for healthy, fresh and tasty cuisine. The restaurant itself reminds me of a dinner (so it's very casual), and the staff were very friendly. I think they have a terrace somewhere but.... I didn't see it so maybe that's just a rumor ;-)I started with the Tonic (ginger, lemon, apple) - my immediate reaction was to purse my lips and widen my eyeballs because DAMN it was tart! But it was refreshingly delicious once I got over my sensory shock!As a meal, I opted for Le Complet (tofu scramble, Tempeh bacon, cornbread,fresh fruit, salad and sweet potatoes). The tofu scramble was good - I liked the texture and flavor. The cornbread was delicious, as were the sweet potatoes. The salad came with this amazing Dill vinaigrette that was so good, I bought a bottle before leaving. The Tempeh bacon did nothing for me. I can't say I enjoyed the taste or texture at all.  Overall, the portion size was quite good (for me, anyway) and the price was appropriate ($11 for the plate).  I plan to go back and try one of their infamous bowls - I've heard they're amazing!They have a small shop out front where you can be pre-made meals, or other items like their vinaigrette, baked goods etc.
LOVED it.  Amazing Vegan food, huge portions, good prices.  The place is super crowded, we went for Sunday brunch, and luckily found a seat.  The service was super quick (if not a bit rushed, but I get it, they were busy), food came quickly, and service was good. No complaints here.  I had the big breakfast with tempeh bacon, tofu scramble, cornbread and sweet potatoes.  Very filling, and kept me energetic and going all day.What a treat to have the creamer be soy creamer!!  Very exciting to be able to pour cream in my coffee!!Very exciting to find a Vegan restaurant in Montreal!!
I bring all my friends here. My favorite foods for take out are : The veggie butter is amazing and a great addition to a sandwich or just a plain bread. Coconut bacon is an awesome meat alternative. The texture and flavor is so unique and very distinctive, you can add in your salad, to give it am extra crunch My only issue with aux vivre is the Indian food, maybe my standard are a bit high . I have eaten Indian food my whole life and I know what it is suppose to taste like. There is little to know flavor and the chickpeas are always hard. My friends that visited me from India agreed with me.
Order a Ginger Tonic as a drink. With a coconut BLT. So good.
No visit to Montreal, historically, has been complete for me without a visit to Aux Vivres. While a bit of a challenge to find the first time I trekked up that way, it remains probably my favourite Montreal vegan restaurant.On my most recent visit in town for Pycon, I managed to get here twice. Looking forward to my favourites, the Montreal Smoked Meat Sandwich (where else can you get a good vegan version?), and the delicious brunch waffles.ALAS! Neither remain on the menu. Instead, on visit one, I had their gyro, splitting an order of chili fries with my dining pals. The gyro was great, made cool and tasty by the tzaziki. The chili fries were a little so-so - about 10 wedges, on a bed of chili, topped with sour cream.The second visit was a bit disappointing. I branched out into trying the Dragon Wrap, with a side of sauerkraut. The calling card of this dish, I assume, is the "Dragon Sauce", which is best described as "orange". It was maybe a bit like French salad dressing. I don't know. All in all not too impressive a sandwich, and I had some serious FOMO towards the BLT that a dining pal was eating, and the gyro that my ghost data from the day before was eating.Topped it off with a coco-cashew cream pie, which was actually pretty excellent, and turned it into a pretty positive experience overall.Still, do I yearn for you, O Montreal Smoked Vegan Meat Sandwich. Maybe I'll try making one at home. I really had my heart set on it.
I love love love the food here! If I lived in Montreal this would be my go-to place for everything. After partying it up super hard - this is the place you wanna go where your body is just going to vaccuum up all the nutrients it lost the night before. Electrolyte love! My body is like a dry shriveled up sponge when I come here and I just suck everything up till I'm wet... wait a sec... this food porn thing is going a little far.I am back home in Vancouver, WISHING we had a place like this, where you can get yummy veggie food and have decent service, and not pay an arm and a leg to get it. I am already looking forward to my next trip to Montreal in September so I can gorge all I want and not leave feeling like I do right now after this festive seasonal break people call Christmas. All I got for Christmas this year was fat, but that's just more of me to love less!
Just ordered a Dragon Sandwich from Aux Vivres.  Didn't come with any sauce.  Anyone who's had anything from there knows the sauce kind of makes their food what it is.  So between no sauce and the high prices, it's competition wins out.
We were visiting Montreal for a long weekend. After trying brunch on the first day we came back every day after! The chai was delicious and the pancakes were the best I've ever had!
My friends and I are vegetarians that enjoy trying interesting vegan fare. We ordered a Thai bowl, Mexicali plate and the Dragon Wrap. The wrap was rather bland and tasted very raw, but the Thai bowl and Mexicali plate were flavorful and filling. The atmosphere inside the restaurant didn't seem that nice, but we ate outdoors in the back patio area which was very cute and relaxing. The menu is offered in both English and French, which turned out well for us since we don't know a lick of French. Overall an enjoyable meal!
Huge portions, the server was very nice, food itself fresh but essentially a giant thai bowl of carrots and three wedges of tofu with undercooked rice. The desserts looked amazing. I feel like this sort of place has built such a rep that they focus on image expansion and commercialization as opposed to actual food, there are cheaper vegan restaurants with better food in the city.
This was just an okay meal for us on our trip to Montreal.  We went for lunch and the food was too heavy on sprouts without enough dressing or flavor.  The breakfast foods look more promising.  The staff was fine, just nothing that stood out to us above average.
As a vegetarian, this was my favorite restaurant during our Montreal visit.  First time, we ordered take out via the ala carte delivery service (like seamless in the US).  When the food arrived (Buddha bowl, a wrap and the apple pie), it was cold due to the winter weather and didn't warm us up after our long day snowboarding.  Needless to say, we were disappointed.  This was the place my best friend recommended us to try in Montreal.   Second time, we decided to give the restaurant another try in person and we came on a sunday night, the last supper of Montreal.  Surprisingly, it was packed.  The red seats and decor are intimate and trendy, suitable for a romantic date.This time, we ordered the Masala plate (chickpea and potato curry with chutney) and the chocolate banana pie for dessert.  The entree was warm, fresh, tasty, and filling.  And dessert was delicious and more impressively, it did not leave a poor after taste as most desserts usually do.  For drinks, we had the chai; it's unique because it uses soy milk instead of dairy milk.  My girlfriend, who is picky about food, was impressed with Aux Vivres. We would definitely come back here if/when we come back to Montreal.
We were starving and in a hurry, so found this place quickly on urban spoon and glad we did. Great menu to choose from, we went with a Buddha bowl and a dragon sandwich, or was it the other way around?! Cornbread to start with and the dip was superb. Really light and fluffy bread. I had a chocolate shake, really thick and rich but not too much. We bought two corn breads and an apple crumble to take home! Yummy when toasted and reheated later. My small dislikes were the incredibly squished in tables - we couldn't get up to use the washroom with asking our neighbours to move their tables.
We were greeted by a very pleasant waitress the moment we stepped in. I like that you have the option to either sit in the restaurant or in the cafe. We stuck with the cozy booth seating. The interior is very clean and I loved the art that was hanging up. I even walked around the restaurant to look at the prints.The souvlaki-style seitan and tzatziki were fantastic! The vinaigrette on the salad was a bit too strong, but the seitan, cut in thick 'meaty' chunks, was flavoured nicely. The soy chai latte was tasty but could have been a bit bigger. My friend devoured her chili. The only disappointment was that her dish was served lukewarm. I just wish that the brunch was available on weekdays; I'll have to try it the next time I'm in town. Solid all around.
They have very tasty fake cheesecakeI always take their special of the day and it's always good. Very fast and good service
The food here is substantial and delicious. This tied with au pied de cochon for favorite restaurant in Montreal.Mekong was delicious, satay sauce and normal fillings.The lox spread is out of this world. Amazing. Exactly like real lox. Magic from dulse and carrot pulp.The multi-spread appetizer is a great intro to the food here.BLT is also amazing. The coconut is smoked/salted just right to swap for bacon. Maybe too much lettuce and not enough mayo for me, but very good.Souvlaki is good. Burgers are amazing and meaty.
So Aux Vivres has excellent food, it really is comfort food. They make everything themselves, including the ketchup! In the week we were in Montreal, we went there 3 times just because there were so many things we wanted to try. They have a special on every day and we tried it twice and it was delicious! The paratha with homemade veggie butter is not to be missed and their juices and smoothies are excellent. They also sell take outs and desserts as well as their own sauces next door. The only problems are that because the place is very popular, there is a long line up after 7pm, and the tables are quite small and close together so you end up hearing everything that happens around you. On the first night, we had to put up with a loud couple who on top of that were rude to the server so it was off putting. The restaurant is also quite noisy. All the desserts we tried were amazing. I wish we had an Aux Vivres in Vancouver!
Wow! Very happy to have found this place. It seems like in Montreal all the vegetarian/vegan places are insanely expensive for what's actually put on the plate. This place, on the other hand, satisfies every bit of hunger I have for under $13. That aside, it's actually really really tasty and they have plenty of options. It's worth trying and ill definitely be taking some friends there!
My first time in Mtl, and friend who lived here recommended this place. Went around noonish on a weekday and it was packed! It was just the two of us so no wait. Lovely, bright place, good service and lots of variety in the menu! We ordered the soup of the day, I think it was curry lentil, and I had the Mekong wrap/sandwich. Soup was delicious, full of flavour and not too runny, with a good consistency. The Mekong was HUGE! I got it with tempeh instead of tofu (first time trying it) and it was really good! All the flavours went really well together. Would definitely recommend it and would love to come back to try more of the menu!
I love this place! It has become a superb must for me on the regular. They make the most delicious & refreshing food and drinks- it's unbeatable for breakfast, brunch....yum!!!!!!!!!!!! go here now!!!!
Smoothies here (Banana Blast with a touch of cocoa for me and Blue Monkey/Tropicana tries for the girlfriend) are delicious treats. They should not be passed up.The food is equally wonderful. Healthy, filling portions of quality vegan ingredients. The salad was huge and colorful. I added coconut bacon from the BLT to it. Great choice. Girl got the Buddha bowl and enjoyed it. We came back again for sandwiches and shared half-each of the Dragon and Mekong sandwiches. Lovely food. Although it's on the pricier than bang-for-the-buck side, it's not enough to detract from a five-star rating in my book. They're open till 11pm on weeknights: THANK you. :)
I'm definitely a fan of this place. I will certainly make it a habit to stop by every time I find myself in Montreal. They do an excellent vegan brunch (a very good tofu scramble). And the dragon bowl is pretty good (would like to see the tofu marinated). But all in all a great place. The whole experience was pleasant both times I've gone. No matter how busy they are, the staff never rushes you.Great atmosphere, great staff and great food.
It's odd that I haven't reviewed Aux Vivres yet. Maybe in an alternate universe I did, but anyway, just to make sure I'd like to note that the bright clean design, the light wood benches, the relaxed funny staff, the leafy back terrasse and convenient takeout counter are all soul soothing. Most welcome though is the hit of fresh, healthy, and tasty always to be found here. The dragon bowl and vegan bacon are my usual picks, but my personal highlight is the creamsicle smoothie. Coconut juice and all manner of healthy things winningly combined to taste exactly like those orangey ice creamsicles you remember from sunny kid days at Grandmas (If you don't have this memory you can borrow mine and then go to Aux Vivres to re-live it. I hope you enjoy!)
Very good restaurant. Nice, hip, yet friendly ambiance which is tough to pull off. Food is healthy and extremely tasty. We had a girl put together an awesome tasting menu for us with what in her opinion were the essentials which included: The Dragon Bowl (tempeh), Vivant Salad (tempeh), and my favorite this plate with an assortment of dips called the 'Mezzé Aux Vivres'. Was great. I went with Amanda, my girlfriend who wants to be included in this review. She thinks i was rude to the waitress but I wasnt.
+1 = loved the Buddha bowl+1 = excellent apple pie+1 = friendly service!+1 = healthy!+1 = fair pricesWill definitely be back next time I'm in Montreal
Here I go, my first review on Yelp. Let me start of by saying that I have never bought any of the items from Aux Vivres but I have gladly munched on many items that my girlfriend has gotten from there. As a non vegan, I would not have paid the money for these items. But as of 11:35pm on a Tuesday night, I have officially changed my mind. Everything that I have eaten from this establishment has been superb! With the exception of the faux egg and bacon brunch plate. That one was a bit of a let down, rather bland if I may say so myself. But everything else has been so on point that I am thinking that perhaps I should try out vegan-ism. I would like to throw out a big shout out to whomever came up with these delicious recipes. Especially the guy that came up with the vegan BLT and the chipotle brownie. I cannot express how satisfied I am with those two items. If i could, I would like to shake hands with the creators. Bravo Aux Vivres, never did I think I would be writing this review. Hopefully you guys can sprout amazing locations like this throughout North America. But until then my allegiance lies to Montreal for the best Vegan food!
Love that it's open late. Bombay Banane smoothy is the business. English and French menu. Slaw that comes with burgers is great and I don't even like slaw!  One less star because each item is at least $1.50 pricier than seems reasonable. However, I still make this a regular stop whenever I'm in Montreal.
Nice vegan fast food-style restaurant. It was very busy but we got a table right away and the service was friendly and quick. I had the portobello burger, which was very nice. I was maybe a bit disappointed because I had expected an actual burger but it was really just a portobello mushroom on bread. The potato wedges and accompanying salad were delicious. My partner liked her assiette Kosmos. The only downside was that it was very loud in the restaurant (including the music), which didn't make for the most relaxing meal.
I love the food here. Recently I have been really into tempeh, organic food, and in the end vegan food. This is a great restaurant to convert people to the way of the bean, soy bean that is. I've eaten take out, where I mostly order the Dragon bowl. It is filling and delicious, it's a must have along with grilled tempeh. On one of my more recent trips I order a the living salad (I think) with tempeh and it was great and surprisingly filling. To start that day we had the corn bread with guacamole, very good. I've had it with both the guacamole and veggie butter, my favorite is with the guacamole, however I think everyone must try the veggie butter. I also shared the Uncheescake Cheesecake which was very good, I am still wondering what they put in it to make it soooooo good. If you are a vegan or enjoy eating healthy you must stop by here. If you want to bring some friends to try their first taste of a vegan restaurant, this is a great choice.
Interesting diner type feel , ugly decor and very dim,, also in front of the front door they have nasty plastic curtain ,,, first thing we got was the water received in a large mason jar,, tasted like water from a Chinese food restaurant, not cold at all,, I got the Thai tofu side with a lug head beer,, beer was interesting, tasted very carbonated,, and had a really bitter taste of hopps,, got my food,, rim of the dish was dirty,, Tofu tasted like it was frozen ,, taste very bland (cardboardish) and it was very tough,, peanut sauce that came with it was quite good actually along with the roasted peanuts ,, it seems the only thing this place knows how to cook is the veggies ,, the Bok choy was really good along with the pickled cabbage and carrots ,, lettuce tasted old and I got something that resembled turnips which tasted like nothing,, I didn't dare taste the rice ,, my friend got the dish and her brown rice looked overcooked I tasted it and it was utterly disgusting ,, it was mushy and so bland,, basil on top of my dish was also old ,, this was my first time to a vegan place and vegan restaurants pride themselves on fresh food , this was a disgrace.
Fantastic dragon bowl! So happy to have fresh, flavorful and healthy food after two weeks of indulging on vacation. It was so good it still felt indulgent! Great spot for vegetarians or anyone wanting to have a good for you meal in Montreal.
yum.
I was very impressed by this place.  Other than the fact that it's overpriced, everything about it was awesome.Ordered the BLT that looked massive, until you go to pick it up and then it feels light as a feather.  Probably about 75% lettuce, a couple tomato sliced and some (what i think is) roasted coconut and mayo sauce (obviously not real mayo but still quite good). I couldn't tell that the latte didn't have real milk in it.The restaurant in general looks more like a giant diner than a normal place, and service is kind of slow. If you're vegetarian or are curious about it, it's worth checking out.
A must visit whenever I'm back in Montreal. I first tried it back in the day when Aux Vivres was still a dank closet with staff with dreadlocks down to their waist and a strong scent of patchouli in the air. They used to have a standard brunch for $11.Then, the tides mysteriously changed and it renovated to the current look and menu. I think a lot of hipster Montrealers took this as a betrayal to the restos' hippie roots and always refuse to go here. I used to adopt the same stance until I tried the deluxe salad, creamsicle smoothie and coconut laced BLT (which tastes far less burnt than it used to).It gets pricey but its good if you want something light. And as a former vegetarian, it's a just try for a menu that you don't have to worry about.Slow service and can get packed in the evening. Decent patio.
I have had the brunch, lunch and supper numerous times. Every time the food is scrumptious and so filling! The service is generally good, unless it is jam packed. The place fills up quickly for suppertime and if you are a group of 4 or more, be prepared to wait as they do not take reservations.I am allergic to dairy and being able to have some non-dairy whipped cream on my waffles make me happy camper.
I just feel good eating here. It's a bit pricey for me, but I can tell everything I've ordered is made with quality ingredients (and it's good for me!) Being a bacon lover, I was a little skeptical of the BLT since the bacon is replaced by smoked coconut but once I tried it, I never looked back. I went with a group of both vegetarians and non-vegetarians, and everyone left happy.Favourite dish: BLTFavourite juice: the Popeye
My sister is OBSESSED with this place. I'm actually not a big veggies fan, so this place was really awesome for me because it made vegan interesting. She ordered takeout one night during a visit to Montreal. I particularly enjoyed the frites. But she raves about the bowls.
Amazing restaurant! There are not many full vegan restaurants around but this is the best one in my opinion. I had the peanut sauce tofu burrito and my friend had the "coconut bacon" burrito. We also had some fresh juices. I recommend the beet apple ginger carrot juice. I've been many times and it never disappoints!
This place gets 5 stars for their huge, fresh selection of vegan options. I've eaten here for the past 2 days and couldn't be happier.
The lunch here is so-so but the brunches are bordering on fantastic. The veggie 'meats' are tasty and cooked just right but the soy milk they give you for the less than impressive coffee just ain't right, it curdles, YUCK!I would have given this place 4 stars, but on my last visit, I was meeting a friend for brunch. She has a Mira dog named Joey that has to be with her at all times as he is in training. He is well mannered, sits under the table and sleeps the entire time. As he was snoozing away and other patrons were smiling at him, the manager walked over and explained that she knows what a Mira dog is and informed us that she called Mira and was told that she does not have to accept the dog into her restaurant.  No one complained about him and we were thrown out...but not before they made me pay the 5,50$ for the smoothie that I was sipping on while waiting for my friend to arrive. I was stunned that they would make me pay given that we were being tossed out into the cold because of the Mira dog and so I handed over 6$ to which she said "sorry, I don't have any change unless I go and open the till."Joey has been to restaurants all over Montreal: fancy and casual and has never been unwelcome before. And here I thought that vegans were animal-friendly, guess not!
Best meal we have had by far in Montreal !
Great vegan food. They have gluten free options. I've been two or three times (it's a little pricey, but worth it). I've tasted the Dragon bowl (my favorite), tempeh burger (good), and the vegan BLT (good but you must like coconut). I would recommend it and I look forward to going back!
I expected to hate it... Now I'll probably go back. I must admit the thought of eating in a vegan restaurant was about as interesting as the thought of sawing my own leg off! In a restaurant world of fatty food, this place fills my need for some healthy grub. The warp was huuuuuuuge. The salad was gorgeous. And the service was very pleasant. No complaints!GO!
Everyone is right. The Dragon Bowl is divine. Sitting solo at the bar, I was served quickly by a friendly waitress, and had the perfect perch to watch the smoothies getting buzzed. Do I want a creamsicle? With coconut milk, orange juice, carrot juice and vanilla. Yes I do!It's a busy bustle, full of healthy looking people sporting yoga mats, talking about tennis and scarfing down the best tasting veggies I've had in a long long time. And yes, we all were taking pictures of our big bowls. I'm already craving my next meal here, and I'm still munching on the leftover beets, carrots, grilled tempah, organic brown rice, daikon, rice, cabbage as I write!
Although I'm not the prototypical client of Aux Vivres, I can certainly appreciate good vegan food and this place offers it up in spades. I usually have the Dragon Bowl with grilled tempeh or the Sirocco sandwich. Both I think are great options for someone not necessarily used to eating this kind of cuisine. Tasty, fresh and healthy, what more does a body need? Maybe a smoothie to wash it down. I personally love mangoes so I recommend the Lassi À La Mangue.It also makes a great meal when you're working late as its not heavy at all and leaves you energized. Maybe all employers should start feeding us Aux Vivres?Bon appetit!
Maybe I was just unlucky on my visit, but I was generally unimpressed by this place. It was crowded, I felt rushed, I was unfortunate to have a coat and a bag and so was spilling out into the busy corridor, and then the food was both hot and cold and tasted very strongly of pickling. I ordered the Thai bowl and parts of it were quite good, but mostly it was difficult to eat as a mixed bowl and not consistent in temperature. What was worse was the overwhelming taste of pickled whatever it was... Anyways, I would go back because I've heard so many rave reviews of this place, but not at a time when I was going to feel rushed, and I'd not try it again after a second experience comparable to the first.
I admit I was a little wary of this place, which is ridiculous as I'm a vegetarian. But then I read the menu, walked in to a cute diner-y looking room with great art and music, and had a wonderful meal. It was so freeing knowing I could have anything on the menu. My little girl loved it too. Granted, she spent the whole time sucking down a mango lassi and eating a wee bit of cornbread. I did wish there were a few kid friendly options. I'm excited that we'll be here another day, so we can go back.
As a guy who is vegan I appreciate the number of options to have here.  It is a massive menu unlike most places where there a binary option of 1 or 0 .  That being said I did not much care for the main dishes of food and I wanted so much to fall in love with it :( The dragon bowl I did not like the sauce, and it wasn't too good dry.  The chili was pretty good, although that's not something unique to vegan restaurant.  The blt was okay but I didn't really like the taste too much.  I tried another appetizer of dipping bread into a nice sauce , that was good.   The carrot cake was excellent and I would like to try more deserts.  The service was great, very friendly both times, nice vibe in the restaurant . It didn't seem healthy food to me, the dragon bowl certainly was, although the rest seemed to be a one way trip to gut city.  Maybe I just need to order different dishes to get a better experience , but I'm not gonna try again until next time in montreal.
The food was incredibly good and there was SO much to choose from. The only complaint I have is that it's too far away from where I live. If I ever get back to Montreal, this place is definitely on my to-do list.
Best vegetarian restaurant in Montreal. Big portions, good price. It's not the classiest joint, but it's easy and the staff is friendly.
Great food! Loved it a lot! Wish there would be more gluten free options tho. Staff was friendly and super nice. It takes time to prepare healthy food people so don't bit..h about the waiting. Can't wait to come back yum yum
Vegan food and fresh juices are O.K. It will please individuals who like diner-style food. Portions are large and prices are moderate. While the food is edible and will fill you up, it is certainly flavorless. You definitely pay what you get. Service is friendly.
The first time i came in i had a most delicious greek grynos but the next time i came in their veggie burger option with fries was a disappointment-too spicy and i got a soso waiter. The meal with tip-in the end is too pricey.I remember when this restaurant was a hole i the wall and much more humane on a side street at another location now its a yuppified diner.Its hit or miss with this one.
Ate here on a Monday, very busy restaurant. There were four of us, each tried a different dish and all were pleased. Waitress was attentive but reserved. Lacked spark or personality. Otherwise, a good meal for all.
This is my favorite restaurant in Montreal! Yes, I love poutine and crepes, but if you want some amazing veggie comfort food come here! Every time I'm in town this is a go to spot. The staff is very welcoming and always gives us a booth in the back(which is less crowded and more intimate than the front of the house). The chili is very good, the vegan soups hit the spot( if you make trips up to Montreal in the cold months esp., as my husband and I always seem to.)  The veggie burger is homemade (unlike the frozen stuff you get elsewhere).  I have not tried their brunch yet, but I will next time I'm in town. Also Blvd. Saint Laurent and Saint Denis are filled with nice shops, eateries, coffee houses, so you could spend a whole just food hopping and absorbing the culture. If you're driving, you can find parking on the side streets off of Blvd. Saint-Laurent.
There was a line to get in for dinner. We waited about 20 minutes. We got the BLT, which was just okay. We also had the Cosmos plate (souvlaki-style seitan, tzatziki, salad, potato wedges & brown rice). It was very tasty. Even the brown rice had flavor in it; could be from the souvlaki. We decided to try the signature dessert - the (un)cheesecake. It was so delicious, although a bit on the tarter side than expected, that we wanted more desert. We ordered the chocolate apple cake, that was really delicious as well. Would go back when in the area to try perhaps their bowls, which a few people had ordered and I am curious about it.
Amazing Vegan food in Montreal, went here as my last meal while visiting, and had brunch on a sunday, this place was pretty full within 10 minutes of opening.  Their smoothies are amazing.  I had a complete brunch breakfast with a tofu scramble and cornbread and tempeh bacon...it was amazing, i polished my plate off in 10 minutes.The soy creamer here is also great in their coffee...decently priced, great service.highly recommended!
First of all I'm a bit of a carnivore, but having eaten my fair share of poutine the night before I was dying for some healthy food! Luckily on my trip to Montreal, my lovely friend and host is vegetarian and this was the first place she took me to and boy was I pleased!  Aux Vivres is bright and lively, beautifully furnished with a cool trendy atmosphere. Reminds me of a diner but with a brand new juice bar and with wooden furnishings. Tres Cool. There's a good selection of smoothies, fruit juices, espressos, teas, organic everything - then sandwiches, burgers, rice bowls, and more! They even had a glossary of terms for non-vegans like me that don't know what Tempeh was! I got the Tofu Burger ($11) with an Organic Soda (2.50). The Tofu burger has this great oniony/mustardy spread and it came with yummy hand cut chunky wedges with a chipotle tomato sauce, and some coleslaw. Everything was pretty tasty - but I kinda looked over and wish I'd gotten the Aux Vivre burger now!  My friend got a Souvlakian plate(?) and she said it was really good. All in all DEFINITELY would come back here, get a smoothie and try a bowl - the food is so bright, colorful and healthy it makes me happy to not have any Poutine for awhile!
Had blueberry pancakes. We're a little light, but very good overall. My GF had huevos rancheros. Those were excellent. Also had mango lassi. Very good. So was fresh OJ.Server disappeared for a while. So took 20 mins or so to get our check.
Shame on me for not coming here sooner. The truth is though, I thought this place was a militant vegan place that would smell the seafood-eating fear in me if I dared to walk through the place. (I'm serious) It turned out to be this sunny looking place with abundant seating.Unlike others I was with, who favoured the revered dragon bowl, I wanted to venture out and got me a Macro Bowl. It was delish but I admit, I like seaweed (wakame) in its natural state and then they had me at the miso-tahini sauce, which is a super combo in my opinion.We ordered a banana chocolate pie to split, and as a crust-head (yes I've coined a new term for those who enjoy crust) it was yummy, pie was a bit too sweet but the smooth and creaminess was very WOW, and I am glad that we split it four ways, otherwise, I would have been groaning the way home. One of the best parts of the meal I think is how awesome the server was, I don't know her name, but she was not only attentive to our water needs, but she was friendly and non-pushy.  She also was honest about her favourites when asked, and seemed very genuine. We also had a baby at the table, and she provided the baby chair thingy no questions asked, (can you tell I wasn't the mother? hahaha "thingy").  Overall I had a lovely time here, and will definitely come back for MOAR!Rumour also has it that they have a beautiful terrace, but I didn't venture there.
Great vegan restaurant. Try the Popeye beverage with the pollenta dish.
great food and smoothies!! Had the blue monkey smoothie which was insanely good, I actually didn't even want to order it but the person I was with wanted it so I agreed, and it was just really the best. The BLT is crazy good too, coconut "bacon" is insane, I just don't know how they do it! And the chapati is great. The only thing is that the portions are huge so probably splitting one sandwich would be enough for two people, and a smoothie of course.
This is a delicious restaurant. Whatever-tarian you are, you will ENJOY this restaurant... The food just TASTE AMAZING. What I like about Aux Vivres:- Delicious, fresh and creative menu- Good smoothies- Beautiful presentation- Reasonable prices- Veggies, veggies, veggies!!!- Real good portions- It is always crowded (more people in there=more healthy people!)- Colors, health and quality!!!What I like less:- The "plain" service (it's fine, it's just not super friendly)- Could be hard to park if you have a car./////////////////////////I am in love with the "Deluxe" salad... And, must try the brunch on week-ends; the polenta is yummmmy!THANK YOU Aux Vivres!!! :)
In a city where hot dogs, submarine sandwiches and poutine are considered staples - this restaurant appears as an oasis. I love the menu and recommend the channa sandwich. I have had better smoothies but the desserts looked delightful and plenty of choices.
Aux Vivres has some great portions spread out over a varied menu. My personal faves are the dragon bowl - a huge heaping pile of veggies and brown rice, the various sandwiches and the saturday-sunday brunch.Some deserts are awesome (the brownies, the cookies), some - not so much (the pies - which can be a bit bland and served as small portions). Everything on the menu is about $2 more than I feel good paying, but it's a clean place with some delicious stand-outs.
I like Aux Vivres, but I think it needs to challenge itself a bit and improve it's food. Vegan food does not have to be just "good for vegan food". Having lived in Portland, Oregon, I've had some amazing meals in vegan restaurants. I understand that the vegan culture in Portland is way more prevalent leading to more competition and therefore leading to restaurants having to challenge themselves and make the best tasting and more creative options on their menus. I think what Aux Vivres lacks is that healthy competition in the city.I had the Aux Vivres burger for my main. The patty itself was good, although the consistency was a bit dry and crumbly. the potato wedges it came with lacked taste and were not prepared properly. they were not crispy at all. I only ate three. The dessert I had was the Chipotle brownie and it was definitely delicious! So, quick conclusion: great try, first of its kind in Montreal, obviously there is a large market for this kind of restaurant considering how there are consistently line-ups to get a table. Perhaps a little bit of competition in the city would make them "up" their game a bit.
The chili is incredible.
Uninspired overpriced vegan food. I cannot believe they got rid of the rye bread. RIP rye bread
Meal: LunchRationale: Our objective was to walk up Saint-Laurent and see what struck our fancy. Aux Vivres struck our fancy. Apparently it's Montreal's first vegan restaurant. Impressive. (And appreciated, given how meat-heavy most French or French-Canadian cuisine tends to be.)Food: I ordered the Burger Aux Vivres, figuring only their best burger would bear the restaurant's name. I think I was correct. It came with the standard fixin's and tasted just like I'd expect it to taste. Not quite orgasmic, but certainly miles better than the frozen veggie burgers a lot of places offer up as a consolation to their herbivorous clientele. Satisfied customer. And I appreciate chipotle mayo.Service/atmosphere: We found Aux Vivres to be bright, cheerful, and scores friendlier than our previous night's experience at La Banquise. Welcome to Montreal. We speak English here. Don't worry. Have a burger.Conclusion: Aux Vivres is a nice, casual lunch spot, if just a bit commercial. I'd return for a decent lunch burger.
Bland, Overpriced. Plus bad service.  We stumbled upon this cool-looking place, hungry and tired after a bike ride.Nice décor and signage, great playlist, but surprisingly lacklustre food. One of us had the assiette mumbai - under-spiced, overcooked, and disappointing at 14 bucks.I ordered  the soup de jour, which arrived only after I asked about 5 times. It too was devoid of any flavour, really.If you want really good, tasty vegetarian food in Montreal, just go to any of the numerous falafel joints you run into. This place is seriously, inexplicably overrated.
A must for vegans visiting Montreal. We went on a Saturday night, and we got in just before the big dinner rush. There was a wait for tables the entire time we were there. Lots of variety on the menu, and very reasonably priced. I'll be going back on my next trip to Montreal.
Fast, friendly and fresh. Creative and really well executed menu and nice staff. Worth the trip from anywhere.
Really like their home made wrap with choice of curry sauce or eggplant. Though the other stuff I'm sick off pretty quickly. Tastes good everytime but it's not a place I go often.
I've been a regular at Aux Vivres for over three years now. The food is wonderful - the portions are generous, and the staff is welcoming. You must have their chana paratha and gyro to say you have lived.
With my relatively new vegetarian preferences, I'll try just about any restaurant with tempeh on the menu. Aux Vivres rewarded me nicely.Great rice bowls, sandwiches, smoothies, and desserts! Food portions were just right for me. I loved the BLT, buddha bowl, thai bowl, bombay banana, mango lassi, and chocolate smoothie. Food disappointments were the veggie lox sandwich (done well but not something I would normally crave) and the cafe frappe (the flavor wasn't quite right for some reason; maybe too much soy milk).During my recent vacation in Montreal, I sat at various times at the counter, in the dining room, and on the terrace. I visited for both lunch and dinner, and never had to wait, although the dining room was often near capacity. The interior of the restaurant is nice, although the layout is quirky, and one of our tables was right below an air conditioner that gave us the chills. The servers were almost consistently friendly, and service was quick.
J'ADORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Everything on the menu is VEGAN friendly. That means I ate safely here without worrying about eggs or milk ingredients. During a recent last-minute escapade to Montreal and after a night of fine red wines, sangrias and la terrasse, my friends and I woke up and came here for brunch.  My girls are awesome, totally not vegan, but was totally agreeable in coming here because I wanted to check this place out so badly before departing the city the same day. The place was packed around noon on a rainy Sunday morning and we waited about 15 minutes for a table. The waitress was rude, maybe she didn't like anglophones.. BUT we spoke FRENCH to her, so it's totally NOT us.I ordered a brunch option called Le Complet, which came with a side salade with green dressing, stir-fry tofu, fake bacon, and corn bread. While my ladies found the stir-fry tofu amazing, I found it a tad bland, the corn bread was good, fake bacon was meh, BUT the side salad was amazing, it was fresh and crisp and the green dressing was divine. This meal also came with coffee or chai, so I chose the chai because it was vegan friendly and I could have my coffee black anytime!We finished our meal with Gateau Faux-mage... fake cheesecake. It tasted exactly like a real cheesecake.. only less sweet and totally better for you because it's vegan and soy... and probably made with cane-sugar, not the refine white sugar crap.I would MOST DEF come back here. If only I lived in Montreal. This city has blown me away, I did not know it was veggie-friendly!! :) *LOVE*Montreal, je t'aime! *bisoux* A la prochaine!
Cute little vegetarian / vegan restaurant.  I personally am a true meat-eater, I'm all about steaks and hamburgers, but that doesn't mean I can't enjoy some vegetarian delights every once in a while (that and my friends wanted to go and I didn't want to be Debbie Downer)I started with a apple / ginger / lemon juice which was ok, but not great.  I wound up leaving half of it and just continuing with water.  Maybe had I been a bit more adventurous then I would have liked something else better?  My sandwich (the Sirocco - eggplant, humus, olive tapenade) was excellent.  It was a bit too creamy, but with those types of ingredients what do you expect.  My friend got the BLT, which is made with coconut bacon, and I wasn't that impressed.  Would have preferred the real thing in that situation! The decor was a bit of a snooze-fest, vinyl booths and regular ol' tables and chairs.  All in all an average experience, but I'd go back again and try something else next time.
The food was very good and I would suggest this restaurant. I like food that doesn't taste as healthy and I have had better raw food, like Pure Food and Wine in New York City. For the price and taste, I rate Aux Vivres a 4.
Francais plus basIf somebody has to sell you that they are Vegan and that it isn't that bad and you bought it, it's most likely because you ate at Aux Vivres. I'm currently on a diet and it's tough. It's tough because I can't find what to do except boring salads and healthy sandwiches. Well Aux Vivres has a great variety in the menu. One of the complaint I always do about vegan/vegetarian it's that they hide they crave for meat by creating a weird toffu mixt simili-meat veggie version. I didn't felt that feeling about Aux Vivres. It has a heavy hippie cuisine flavour to it. Really creative vegan cuisine. Slightly asian inspired but also being audacious in some great smoothes (One with Celery, Mango and other stuff I can't remember and tasing awesome is pretty bold. Great portion an UBER-CHEAP. Which explains why it's always pacted.Si quelqu'un veut vous vendre qu'être végétalien c'est le Paradis et que vous avez embarqué c'est parce qu'il t'as fait manger chez Aux Vivres. Actuellement, je suis sur une diete et c'est difficile d'être créatif avec de la bouffe santé quand t'as étudié en cuisine française (Beurre beurre beurre). Une des plaintes que j'ai de la cuisine Végét (Arien ou Alien) c'est l'obsession de créer des mets qui contient de la simili-viande parce qu'ils sont intrinsèquement carnivore-endormi. Je n'ai pas eut ce feeling chez Aux Vivres. Au contraire, on démontre un menu risqué mais simple avec des plats du jour. Des smoothies qui combien céleri et fruits exotiques - bizarrement délicieux. Il y a une certaine twist asiatique et même fusion mais c'est surtout de la cuisine de hippies avec une tournure bien végétalienne. Belle découverte! et VRAIMENT pas cher, ce qui explique pourquoi la place est toujours remplie.
Aux Vivres is a great spot- crowded- so we aren't the only ones who think so.We needed something relatively healthy after many hours in the car travelling from the U.S. and this place definitely delivered in both taste and portion. The burgers are huge- HUGE- and really tasty. I had the Burger Aux Vivres- very veggy-y and tasted amazing. The handcut fries are a great touch as well as the homemade ketchup. Really no drawback to this place- other than it's popular- so you might have to wait a bit before getting a seat. Absolutely would go back.
This review is only about the cheesecake, which is amazing. Not dense, it's a fluffy cheesecake and had a really delicious berry topping. Sure it's $6, but it's a heaping helping.
Oh man...I am so disappointed to have to give Aux Vivres only 3 stars. I want to give it at least four, but here's the scoop:The food is tremendous, really excellent. The portions on everything are huge. I ordered the famous coconut BLT (they use liquid smoke and nutritional yeast, then dehydrate the coconut meat) and, stupidly, got a side of roasted potatoes. Wrong! The sandwich on chapati (delicious bread BTW) was the length of my forearm. Potatoes were so much overkill, but still wonderful too. Rounded it off with a Santa Cruz pink lemonade. Yum. Wife got some sort of hummus wrap on chapati and dahl soup.  The service was okay, pretty indifferent, but Montreal waitstaff works at its own pace and stupid Americans who may be used to faster service should just come and chill for a spell. don't worry about the service.So here's the issue: it was hot as balls inside the restaurant (no AC?), we opted to sit outside. As we finished the meal, we noticed that the bricked in patio (cute with all the veggies growing in raised boxes) must be next to the alley. There was a strong smell of the dumpster and garbage floating across the restaurant and it was so nauseating that I almost threw up! No joke. It was terrible. I literally had to leave the restaurant and go out onto the boulevard  to get some fresh air. It took quite a while to feel better.Human beings CANNOT smell rot while they eat! It tricks the body into thinking you're eating poison. That is what the gag reflex is for. I cannot really fault Aux Vivres for this, but then again maybe I can. Poor planning on the part of the owners, or maybe they just didn't know.I will be back to Aux Vivres for sure, because the food is fantastic, but I will be getting it TAKE OUT!!!!
We visited aux vivres three times in one week because we loved the food, concept, and service. This would have been a five star review however our first visit was a deal breaker. The hostess took our name and said it wouldn't be long. She took the names of three French speaking couples behind us and sat them before us. She even gave us a smug look as she was doing it. To the owner... so sorry for the one star but we are restaurant professionals who know blatant contempt when we see it. Not sure what her problem with us was other then that we did not speak French. We try to come to Montreal every summer so perhaps after our next visit, if your host staff treats us fairly, you'll get the five stars you deserve.Update, looks like we're not going to get to Montreal this year. Here's the five stars you deserve. That hostest is probably long gone by now.
Montreal's filled with beautiful people speaking a beautiful language, so after soundcheck at La Sala Rossa we decided to walk down St-Laurent, taking in the sites and possibly some dinner.  We spotted a VEGAN place across the street that looked real healthy and the clientele was nothing short of bonny, so we took a booth.THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!!!!  If yer touring through Montreal, you MUST eat here.   So many good things on the menu and they're all made with some serious love.  The wait staff is super pretty and nice too... Giancarla had the Dragon Bowl and thought it was "excellent." She felt the cabbage and the carrots and the sauce that came with it were "so fresh" and not "vegetabl-ey."  She went on to say, "the dressing was real yummy and the rice on the bottom had some sort of sauce,...I didn't know what it was, but loved it anyway."Sondre had the Buddha Bowl and states, "I come from this with a perspective of someone who's not a vegetarian or vegan, but I like exploring and I thought it looked like a great establishment and I was VERY impressed.  I'd say it was Ace. I felt very good about the meal and I'd never had tofu like that before.  [the tofu] Tasted so good.  And the healthy portion of broccoli is always a plus.  You know me, I'm not big on dressings and dips and all that shit, but this sauce was perfect.  The stuff on the rice was super good and I liked all those pumpkin seeds.  It felt like a full, hearty, and healthy meal."As for me, I had the Thai Bowl and was real happy with all the carrots, those big stems of bok choy, the brown rice, the peanut sauce, and tofu, but I must say, If I were to do it all over again, I'd go with the Buddha Bowl.  I was so jealous of all that broccoli!  (Luckily, Sondre was kind enough to share)  The Bowls are definitely big enough to share or take half home for the van ride later, so keep that in mind when yer planning ahead to your post-show-midnight-meal.  All 3 of us got the fresh juices and were blown away. Sondre and Giancarla got the TONIC (Apple, Lemon, Ginger) which was super spicy and made them feel like it was immediately working on repairing the throat and boosting their sinus immunity.  A+!   I was elated to drink the (Apple, Carrot, Beet) juice cuz I know Beets are so good for me. Health...in a glass.  Sondre even went nuts an ordered a fancy green tea on top of all that (for his pipes).  He was in a decadent beverage heaven, of which, he'd make a solitary promise to re-visit as often as possible through the consumption of fresh and healthy juices around the country; or die trying.  (at least that's what his expression supposed)We didn't have time to eat dessert, but I can't imagine it'd be anything less than "fett."GO EAT HERE!!!!~Dave "Herremannen" Heilman
Love it! I have yet to try something here that I didn't like. My personal favourite meal here is the mekong wrap with a creamsicle smoothie. Delicious. Corn bread with guac is a solid starter. One thing I always find bizarre though, is that when ever I upgrade from bread to the chapati wrap, the wraps are in fact just made of pita. This has happened several times. Maybe I'm missing something, but I'm pretty sure that chapatis and pitas are not generally considered to be one and the same. Note to Aux Vivres chefs/menu-makers, if you are reading this: Miriam Webster defines 'chapati' as "a round flat unleavened bread of India that is usually made of whole wheat flour and cooked on a griddle". Just thought you should know.  The chana 'chapati' is also very good, though can get pretty soggy (again, this may be because it is in a pita, not a chapati). Personally, I enjoy sitting at the counter (or anywhere on the lefthand side of this place), but hey, it's all good.
Go there. If you are reading Yelp and wonder where to go, just go there. It means you either want to discover something new or want a safe choice. Either way, go there. This is the type of place that you simply have to know. Nope, I have nothing to recommend. Veggie food with awesome taste. I give it 5 stars for the price.
I'd give this place 3.5 stars if I can.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I love my vegetables enough that I am very happy when I see a vegan restaurant.I got the tofu dragon bowl (tofu, daikon, shredded vegetable with brown rice).  I wish they'd mix the vegetable a bit more.  It came in a bowl (duh), but it was somewhat hard to eat as there were a lot of shredded vegetable falling off.  So I ended up eating a lot of carrots at once, cabbage another time, etc.  Nothing extraordinary about the vegetable.  The sauce with brown rice was good though.My friend had the tofu burger, and she wasn't too pleased with it.  Another friend got the cornbread with veggie butter and the curry cauliflower soup.  They were both very filling, and she didn't care for the pepper in the cornbread.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't spectacular.The waitress was really slow with our service.
Went with my wife, 2 daughters, my niece, and her girlfriend. We were seated quickly. We ordered snacks (fries, light sandwich) and then some desserts. The desserts were the real reason we went. The milkshakes were to die for. We have dairy and gluten issues in the group and they accommodated without an issue. They would have 5 stars if the service had been faster - the server quite literally walked past our table several times while we were calling out and did not come. Even when we did so in native french (as we had a couple of french as first language folks with us). But I'd be willing to bet it's an anomaly and I'll give them the next star if I go back and see different. The food and atmosphere were directly on target.
Get the Me-kong sandwich on chapati, but ask for the sauce on the side. I'm gonna ask for that next time since the past 3 times i've had it there, it has been soaked with sauce. Also love their orange creamsicle smoothie, the chipotle brownies, the BLT, and they have a decent tea selection. Oh and lattes are nice too. Go in the summer! They have a lovely outdoor seating area, decorated with lanterns and plants and herbs. ALSO: Tegan AND Sara eat there ;)
I've lived here about a year and this place is so far my favourite Montreal food - and I'm not vegan.   You can't go wrong with any of the sandwiches but my faves are the Mekong and the BLT (with roasted coconut as a bacon replacement - YUM).  Also the chocolate cake is to die for.  Service-wise very good and fast.  They are especially great about keeping water cups filled and replenishing you table pitcher of water.  I love that they have a separate side for to-go orders too, so the two are not competing service wise.
I'm not vegan, nor a vegetarian, but I love me some Aux Vivres. I find it really difficult to find restaurants that give you large quantities of cooked leafy greens in Montreal, unless we're talking about Chinese food. But Aux Vivres does just that in their rice bowls, particularly the Thai and Macro options. I make it a point to have a meal here every time I'm in Montreal. I initially came for the chapati wrapped sandwiches (especially the CLT, duh!), but since finding out about a gluten intolerance, I also really appreciate that Aux Vivres makes it very clear which items are g-free on their menu. Went for lunch on a Friday afternoon. I ordered the Thai bowl with smoked coconut on the side. My boyfriend ordered the Sirocco and a salad. The food came quickly, the service was great, and we didn't feel rushed. The dressings and sauces were very unique and tasty... and I liked the light marinade they used on my tofu. I keep on wanting to try their desserts, but I just keep on getting too full from my main dishes! Until next time, Aux Vivres!
To balance out the poutine we ate while in Montreal, we sought out some restaurants on the healthier side of the spectrum. Aux Vivres was one such restaurant that was not only healthy but truly satisfying. My Thai sandwich wrap was really flavorful and filling, and the Creamsicle smoothie tasted sweet but not sinful.Prices are pretty reasonable, too, with dinner for 2 coming out to about CAD$30.Service was pretty laid-back -- for the first 10 minutes, we wondered whether we actually had a server. Perhaps they were just making the Americans chill out for a minute...
4.5 stars, really. The food and service are amazing. Seriously, the BLT is as big as your head, and if you close your eyes, it tastes like real bacon. Not for nothing though, I find that a lot of the place's sauces are overly-acidic. The magnificently-crafted Thai Rice Bowl is somewhat diminished by what I see as a saucing that should be slightly thicker, and a little more "peanut-" Despite this, and no pun intended, this place is awesome sauce.
Up until recently, I had only ever had takeout from Aux Vivres. Which is fine for me and my lazy-arse homies, aside from the fact that when it did reach our plates, it wasn't all that warm (i.e. it was cold *heavy sigh*). As a result of these experiences, however delicious, I may have initially given this place 3 or 4 stars. Luckily for me and the Yelpers who are reading this, I managed to get my booty to the establishment last week, and what a gem this place is! Pretty cute place I have to say, with equally cute employers. I'm pretty sure I'm allowed to throw that in there, but really you should all be checking out this vegan hotspot for its, ahem, food. My friend and I split the Aux Vivres burger and Mekong wrap, which equalled glorious choices on our parts. In the past, I've had the Dragon and Thai bowls, and oh man....even when made 45-60 minutes earlier (thanks SLOW delivery service!), they were still brilliant dishes. To end this lil review, I will most definitely return to delight in more vegan cuisine. After all, I love healthy food and this food will make you feel good. What will also make you feel good is oogling the nice looking staff that work there - unless you get caught. Then, you're just creepy like me.
I've been here around ten times by now. Every time I have been blown away but the quality of the food (service sometimes leaves a little to be desired, but they do their best). Get the dragon bowl... It's like the vegan answer to Mac and cheese.
This is just one of those place that vegans and vegetarians alike enjoy going to. And they have done a good job of it. Everything we ordered I enjoyed. Particularly I liked the Bombay smoothy and the channa with paratha. One thing I noticed is that there were three either recent-made-moms or about-to-be-moms there. I don't know if it means anything, but it is something I observed while I was there. I guess it is a family friendly place.This place is worth a visit. You will not be disappointed. There is tons of variety. You might only be disappointed that you can't eat it all at once. :)
On Sunday, after working up an appetite at the Lindy Hop workshops and just before leaving Montreal and heading back to Toronto, we had dinner at a vegan restaurant called Aux Vivres....Read the rest of the review:alltheveganthings.com/po…
It's so good, we ate there twice on a three night trip and I wish we went three or more! The food is exceptionally delicious and fairly priced. I can't wait to go back for the uncheesecake alone!
I was super excited to go to a vegan/vegetarian place because I've been trying to lead a meat-free diet. However, I was rather disappointed with the food. My friend had the Soup of the Day (pea soup). She liked it, but I thought it tasted a little under-seasoned, and the texture of the vegetables in the soup was grainy (over cooked?).I ordered the BLT in a chapati wrap, at a friend's recommendation. The coconut chips were great taste and texture wise (although my friend thought the chips were too hard). My biggest problem was the ranch dressing -- over-powering and way too salty. I had half of my friend's vegetarian chili, which was great! Good, hearty flavour. Could hardly believe that it didn't contain meat. Friend's mango lassi was thick, but had too much ice. Not enough of that mango and yogurt tang flavor. Service was AMAZING. Though the restaurant was busy, we got seated and served very very quickly. Really nice waiters!
I was told ahead of time that Aux Vivres was the first and is still the most popular vegan restaurant in Montreal. Being vegetarian, I had to try it! I was not disappointed. The place is fairly easy to get to and there are enough options to suit even the pickiest eater. The place was packed (with silly hipsters) when I got there. Unfortunately I didn't get to eat much, but I did get the chilli, and it was delicious! The drinks looked really good, and a lot of people near me were getting dessert, but I was already full...next time. Also, the staff are really nice here. Definitely try it out if you want quality comfort food.
Pretentious, boring, contradictory.  Their menu totes "freshest ingredients, giving priority to local and seasonal produce, to create surprising flavour combinations and unusual dishes that you won't find anywhere else."  This statement is a stretch by any means, I have been to many vegan and vegetarian restaurants, that have blown my mind with unique and innovative cooking. This is not one of them. Tofu and tempeh burgers are a dime a dozen. As are asian fusion bowls but not with the hefty price tag of 13 to 15 dollars, for a veggy bowl. What is local or seasonal about daikon, dulce or wakame? Let's be honest about what this restaurant truly is; it does not cater to much of the vegan crowd, because most vegans wouldn't pay the inflated prices for things they could easily make at home.  Most vegans and vegetarians have had their share of tofu and tempeh burgers, if not a few hundred veggie bowls. Therefore, lets truthfully admit that this restaurant caters to the curiosity of non vegan and vegetarians offering trendy fare at a price. The staff were rather aloof, and had us standing at the host station for 10 minutes, while looking over a virtually empty restaurant. Furthermore when we were seated by who we thought to be our server, she said nothing to us and walked away from the table after seating. She then returned  with a bottle of water (for 3 of us)filling our glasses with water and walked away. 20 min later our glasses were empty and we were still waiting to order. When we finally made eye contact with one of the other employees behind the juice bar(who was leisurely chatting with other staff behind the bar), the original host/server finally came over and begrudgingly  took our order. After our food arrived our water glasses remained empty ( we think that they only allowed us one bottle of water because they expected us to buy drinks, such as $4.50 for 8oz of juice) and no one came to check on us to see if the food or order was to our satisfaction. To top it off the server had forgotten to bring a bowl of soup, but didn't realize.  Then another sever showed up at the table with soup in hand after we had already finished our meal.  After asking him to pack it to go, he returned with the bill and has the audacity to start chatting us up, almost as thought he was hoping to get a good tip. WTF?!The food was satisfactory, but all in all the place left a bad taste in our mouths and a hole in our wallets.
Holy Crap. This place a wonderful. I am the type of person who tries to eat at as many different places as possible. When I travel, I try not to waste precious stomach space on the same place twice. BUT this place is SO AWESOME. I ate here 3 out of the 4 days I hung out in Montreal. Their food is AMAZING! I am one who is not easily fooled by so called 'healthy' desserts, however, their desserts while healthy are delicious as well! The only item I am critical of are their shakes and smoothies. Mmmmm... Dragon bowls. Don't miss out on their Veggie Lox
Okay, so, my first meal in Montreal, this is a famous vegetarian/vegan place in town.  The wait was not very long, about 20 minutes, but hey, must be good!  The food was actually good but not amazing.  The sandwiches are a bit blend, needs seasoning, even for vegan you need seasoning.  They did gave us some dipping sauce for the sandwiches, but how does that work with sandwiches which aren't even in a torpedo shape?  I got an shake to go with my meal.  I was starving and had to get some sort of protein.Overall, the experience was a bit rushed and crowded but the food justified the wait.  Here's my horrible experience with the hostess.  She should not be a hostess at this restaurant.  I'm a Canadian myself, but lives and works in the US.  At the counter, I handed my american $20 bills to the hostess to pay for the meal.  Her first reaction was "This bill is fake!"  I said what?  What do you mean by fake?  She claim the graphic design on the american $20 bill is fake.  I assume she was joking with me so I laughingly told her the bill is an older version of the new bill.  Its still valid, just was printed in the 1970s not the year 2000.  She then yelled at me called me a liar and ran off into the kitchen (the restaurant is crowded and loud).  Leaving me, my friends, and the poor waitress staring at each other blindly.  The waitress said "sorry." and smiles and sneaks away.  I then pulled out my other $20 USD with the UPDATED graphics.  The hostess came back and I handed her the $20 USD bills.  She stared at them and examines them with her high tech possibly racist eyes.  She stared at me and angrily shelved me the change.  By this point I'm ragingly angry.  I was determined to get her fired, but my boyfriend talked me out of acting as silly as the hostess.  I walked to the waitress and gave her a $10 CND for tip, since she was so nice to us.  Then we left.  About 6 blocks later, I realized the hostess gave me back the wrong change, she had given me $10 CND short of change.  At that moment I had to decide whether I should make the rest of my trip about getting her fired or enjoying Montreal with my fellow french canadian friends.  I chose the third option, yelp.
Let me just add that the chili cheese fries are a fucking dream come true. I probably wouldn't have ever tried them, had it not been for my visiting boyfriend, but boy am I glad I did. Aux Vivres does not serve french fries, rather they use potato wedges, thick and full of flavor, topped with a SPICY (yes, finally, spice in a Montreal restaurant!) and excellent chili. There is only a little vegan cheese added on afterwards, keeping the dish simple, but soft and creamy and full of spice and flavor. I will definitely be trying it again.
If Montreal's winter beauty, adorable vintage glasses clad folk strolling the plateau, or charming architecture did not steal my heart over the weekend, then Aux Vivres sure did the trick. During my week's visit to Montreal, trying Aux Vivres was one of the most prominent things on my agenda. It sounds silly, but vegan restaurants like this do not come around often in Canada. Vegans, picture going into a restaurant, and being able to eat anything on the menu ever. This drove me crazy. After much debate, I eventually settled for the Kosmo's Plate- an incredible array of seitan, tzatziki, potato wedges, greek salad, rice, etc. I finished off my meal with a pot of soothing chamomile, and the BEST slice of gateau faux-mage (uncheesecake), I have ever been served in a restaurant in my life. I mean that, and I have been to some pretty famous vegan restaurants in my time. That makes me sound like an old woman. I am also a vegan baker myself, and wouldn't have done much differently. When Montreal and its charming swagger finally wins me over and I decide to move there on a whim one day, this is where I will take all of my non-vegan friends to convert them, and where all of my food dates ever will be. Aux Vivres, I might be in love with you. I don't even care if the feeling is mutual. I love you so much that you can still see other people. :)
I've been here twice already and I have nothing but love for this little place. I think I may have actually dreamed about their roasted cornbread. It's hearty and slightly spicy served with a vegan butter sauce. I recommend this in combination with the GIANT veggie chili served with guacamole. It keeps very well overnight. Their macro bowl is also particularly good. It is a cleverly conceived combination of fresh organic veggies over steamed brown rice. To my taste, I think this dish could be improved (ever so slightly) with some enoki mushrooms, but I'm not sure how those fly with the macro lifestyle.  As for the ambiance, I very much enjoy their summer patio. They've done very nicely with it.
One of my favourite vegan restaurants.Nearly every dining experience I have had here has been great.  The price of a meal might make a bit of a dent in your wallet, but it's more than worth it.  In any case, for $12 I usually end up feeling full or nearly full.  The frustrating thing about Aux Vivres is that there are so many things to choose from, and so it is a constant inner struggle every time I visit on whether I should order something I've had before or try something new.  The last time I went I opted for the day's special - some pizza with a side salad.  It was fantastic.  I ordered a gyro to go as well and it was just as good.  During the summer months the creamsicle smoothie is one of the best fluids you could ever put down your throat.  In the colder months (or actually, any time now that I think of it), one of their delicious lattes hits the spot as well.The staff are knowledgeable, generally friendly, and bilingual.  I have had some servers here in the past give me some attitude after they received my tip (which is always more than 15%), which I did not appreciate - but guess what?  They no longer work there.  The servers usually fill up the water regularly, which is very much appreciated.  It's as if they know I'm dehydrated every time I walk in there.The atmosphere is semi-comfortable, but not always that inviting.  Sometimes I'm seated right next to other couples and they comment on the insane things I'm saying to my date/friend/self, which can be a little annoying when it's uninvited.  However, the setting is a great place to play the "Guess Who's Not Vegan in the Vegan Restaurant" game, if you're into that sort of thing.I am glad I don't live next door to Aux Vivres because I would eat there every day.  I would bring my jars of pennies to the bank just to get extra cash to eat another tofu burger.  The staff would know me by name and frown as I would dump change on the counter, begging them to give me just one more slice of uncheesecake.Yeah, so it's good.  Go try it out if you haven't.  You'll like it.
Aux Vivres, the staple of Vegan Montrealers and foodies alike. Originally fashioned as a sandwich and smoothie bar (and still retaining these qualities), Michael Makhan (owner, chef, menu designer) expanded to a full size restaurant in 2005.Although the entire menu is strong, Aux Vivres remains strongest in their fundamentals: sandwiches. The BLT (with smoked coconut bacon) is a must, and the option to put it on chapati should not be an option - there is no other way to have it. Two of their seitan based sandwiches are among my faves: their Montreal smoked meat, and their gyro. I know some meat eaters would cringe at the thought of using a meat substitute in such venerated meals - but trust me, your palate will thank you.In other options are their bowls, which while good, I'm not overly blown away by, as this is closer to something I can make on my own. The dragon bowl is probably the best here.In their comfort foods section, their chilli and chilli fries are both great, as well as their "Mumbai plate", a terrific fusion dish of Indian flavours.The only downside is that they have no alcohol license (bring your own nor table service), and the setting is just not that welcoming for languishing after a meal. But they've got it where it counts, the food.
The food is delish. It is rare to find good vegetarian/vegan food and this place served it up for sure. Although I have noticed the prices sneaking up of late the food is still worth it. And yes the coconut bacon BLT Wrap with vegan mayo IS that good. There hasn't been anything ordered that I didn't enjoy, and that includes the bites I have stolen off of my friend's plates :) kudos to the cooks.I recommend:VeggiepâtéChiliBLT wrapBuddah Bowlthe Soupe du Jour is usually bangin'the Brownies are yum and so is the Chocolate/banana PieStaff is bilingual which is bonus and they accept cash/debit and CC.Downside? Holy lineups Batman! To be fair the first few times weren't too bad and the staff were friendly, however last time we waited for almost an hour to be seated (no exaggeration). Granted we were a group of  7, not as easy to seat, but I feel that with better seating management and planning this could have been avoided. People with only 2 or 3 were constantly given priority over us and then there was a couple who walked right by the line of about 15 people, went up to the hostess whom they obviously knew, and were immediately seated at a table that was just cleared. When we were seated they tried to fit us at a 4-seater table even though the table next to us was free. So we pulled it over and made it work, which noticeably pissed the waitress off and would explain the extra slow service and attitude we got that night.As soon as we got our food though all was forgiven... or at least forgotten :) And yes I do plan on returning, several times, although I will probably avoid going in a larger group and Thurs-Sat evenings. Or evenings period. Come to think of it take out is prob best.
If I lived in Montreal I would eat here every day and I would be broke! Ordered the dragon bowl with tofu to go, thoroughly enjoyed it and the serving size was very generous but it was still about $14 after taxes which is a little pricey.
The food is tasty and unusually large-portioned for a "Save the Earth" place.Despite everything I'm a fan.  This is probably because they are really friendly as people though others may disagree.The "everything" I refer to is...  EXPENSIVE, slow service, sometimes long lines, hippie tree huggers everywhere, dirty  washrooms, no daily specials, crappy desserts (because they are vegan!), uncomfortable seating, renovations that took months instead of weeks, and completely untrained service.
I went to this place on two occasions. Once with my vegetarian friend (who showed me the place) and once with my girlfriend. Both times were different experience and both were amazing.On my first visit with my friend, there was a pretty big line (I might be exaggerating, the line was maybe 10 minutes), so we decided to use the pick-up counter and eat in a nearby park. We both had sandwiches in chapattis and both we super good (I can say without a doubt that mine was, my friend said his was too). I was looking for something refreshing and fresh, and that was exactly what I got.On my second visit, we got a seat inside. The waiters were very kind and the service was fast. My girlfriend and I both ordered the dragon bowl (a nice bowl of veggies with rice) and a shake (I got bombay banana). The dragon bowl was so delicious and the shake was super flavorful. We had been walking around in the heat all day (and had some sugary stuff earlier) and we just wanted something fresh and healthy. The dragon bowls delivered! Plus it came to 40$ (before tip) for the both of us!I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants something fresh and delicious.
This place is super cute. I think they have a good selection on their vegetarian menu. They give a hefty portion so be prepared to get  a doggie bag or bring your appetite. Their wait-staff are bilingual which is great & so is their menu. Check it out,because it is delicious.
I feel this place deserves an update not because my opinion has changed, but because I was recently in Montreal for three days and ate here twice. That's the second time that happened. And that says something.The staff is just amazing. They're patient, kind, give great suggestions, and, on the whole, really rule. My server told my indecisive self to go with the tempeh burger, served with excellent cole slaw, chipotle ketchup, and potato wedges ($9), and I'm happy I did. Fantastic. And it's absolutely massive, so prepare to enjoy the glory of a light-night snack!It's a great place to take yourself on a solo date too. No wait if you sit at the counter (where, if you feel like it, you'll get to shoot the shit with wonderful strangers. Trust me.).
Good food, fun atmosphere. We ordered a breakfast plate and a smoked coconut BLT (loved it!). Even though the portions are huge, my husband actually ate two of the breakfast platters, one right after the other, and really impressed the waitress. We had to wait awhile to get a table, but the service was friendly (if not super fast) and bilingual. I remember the restaurant being kind of noisy, but I'm glad it's so popular.I would definitely go to Aux Vivres again if visiting Montreal.
Aux Vivres was recommended by a friend and it did not disappoint. The server was gracious with our request to converse in English. The menu was diverse and all the ingredients were really fresh. My husband and I split the cornbread appetizer with veggie butter and guacamole, the "BLT" with coconut bacon, as well as the sirocco sandwich. We ended the meal with a pot of yerba matte tea. The food was excellent, service excellent and the prices were fair. It's also in a great area for perusing vintage shoppes and record stores.
I'll start by saying I'm neither vegan nor vegetarian and I love this place. My boyfriend is lactose-intolerant and it is the one restaurant he can go to and not be afraid to order anything at all, even the desserts. I've tried a variety of their dishes, but I have to say my favorites are the bowls. The combination of warm rice, grilled tofu, fresh veggies and the yummy dressings always do it for me. I've yet to try one I didn't like, and I've even tried recreating them at home. The veggiepate is delish as well, I'd never had it before I tried it here and I immediately became addicted. The desserts are amazing too, though I'm usually too full to order one. I love their cookies! They often come home with me. The only thing I've been a bit iffy on are the drinks. Last time there I had the fresh apple juice and it was... not good. It was pulpy, which normally would be fine, but it was that sort of wooly taste you get when you bite into an apple that's past it. And the juice itself just didn't taste like anything, it was watery and had an odd aftertaste. If the apples just aren't up to snuff, then don't serve it. But, my boyfriend had the mango lassi and it was divine (i stole sips from it while he wasn't looking) so it's not all bad.
Was in Montreal for four days and ate here twice! The food is excellent, the wait staff is friendly, attentive and quick.  The polenta during the weekend brunch is AWESOME!  I'll be sure to come back on my next trip to Montreal.
This place was amazing. The food was great and the menu had a wide range of options, inspired by Indian, Greek, Thai, Chinese and Mediterranean cuisines, to name a few. I had the Sirocco wrap, which was okay, and my boyfriend had the Dragon bowl, which was awesome. I was pretty jealous. I wish I'd tried the BLT -- it's got good reviews here, and a good vegan BLT is so hard to find.
Prices double every year. I miss the old pre-macdonalized aux vivres. Still good dragon bowl if in a pinch but not what it was.
I was only in Montreal a week, but went here twice! The food is very fresh, amazing, the portions are huge, and best of all, *everything* is vegan. The first time I went, I got the buddah bowl and nectar juice (apple, carrot and beet) and my boyfriend got the seitan sandwich and the creamsicle smoothie. Everything was soooooooo wonderful!The second time, I got the la polenta brunch, which is fried polenta, black bean refritos, guacamole, salsa & salad. I also got a side of tofu scramble and espresso. The polenta was probably the best polenta I have had in my entire life. I don't know how they prepared and breaded it so perfectly. My boyfriend ordered the faux lox sanwich on chapati bread and a cafe frappe. All of that was delicious. My boyfriend also got soup, which wasn't memorable. We also shared cheesecake, which was excellent. We always have to take advantage of vegan desserts. The prices are well worth it for what you get.To those who complained about the service, maybe you should stay in America. I recommend Red Robin, where they're up your a-- every 5 minutes.
was amazingly delicious and i'm not vegan! i just felt so healthy but full eating there!the place is kooky and casual...need to go back
Indifferent to neglectful service on a Friday night. The food was good once it finally came, but we considered eating our fingers in the interim.
Always packed. It's better to order takeout. for vegan food (which usually tastes like cardboard) it's excellent. I recommend the dragon bowl with Tempe.
Very fast service , the food is always fresh and rejuvenating.
Pretty tasty for vegan. I ventured out to Aux Vivres early on a Thursday (6pm) to be sure to get a spot as this resto always looks full!My friends ordered the Thai bowl and I ordered the Dragon bowl.  I think mine definitely looked tastier.  In any case, they were all a pretty good portion and you will definitely feel full after.  Too bad because those Energy Balls they had for dessert looked really tempting.
I am a big fan of this small place in Montreal for their healthy and delicious vegan meal!
Overall we had a great experience here.  It is hard to find nice vegetarian places when traveling.  The smoothies were awesome.  The selections of items were great as well.  The one thing that was a turn off was there secret "cheesecake".  We asked what was in it and was told it was top secret and can't be told.  This was because people might make it at home.  I'm sorry but most people can never make the same recipe from a restaurant even if they try.  I own a restaurant and give away all of my recipes.  I am honored when people ask for recipes.  So of course we skipped dessert :(
Coconut! Bacon!Is there anything else left to say?Ok, maybe a little. Housemade flatbread, fresh vegetables, huge portions, a cheesecake that I honestly didn't love...but...coconut bacon! I love vegan BLTs with tempeh, but coconut bacon is just so much more exciting.
Nice little diner-type place that is very popular - Montreal must be teaming with veggie-people (and here I thought it was the land of smoked meat!)  The menu was heavy on the tofu, which I'm not a fan of in general, but the hummus and smoothies were both very good.  The staff & patrons are a bit on the alternative side, so get ready to show your tattoos off.  Overall, a cool spot that I'm sure is 7th heaven for true vegans.
Everything is very innovative and fresh.  There's a huge variety on the menu, with creative combinations and uses of vegetarian ingredients, and the selection goes beyond anything I've seen at vegetarian places in the Southern California area.The place is casual, so service is minimal but very pleasant.Vegetables are crunchy, sauces aren't too heavy.  Portions are very generous, and prices are reasonable despite that it's vegan/vegetarian.  I'd recommend the BLT type of wrap, which has lots of flavors and textures going on. Soup was also really tasty and satisfying on a cold November day.  I'd definitely recommend it for vegetarians and non vegetarians alike.
I went here on my recent weekend trip to Montreal after read recs on yelp. We went pretty out of our way to go here for lunch and we enjoyed it but were not blown away. We shared the cold plate with a delicious veg pate, hummus, veggie puree, and a veg lox which I was less excited about. We also split a seitan sandwich was good and a choc coconut smoothie. Would love to have a place like this near me, but again did not fee like a place worth walking 25 blocks out of our way.
Great vegan. Dragonbowl or thaibowl + vege pâté wrap for 2 are filling and tasty. Ginger cookie is a must.Ambience is slightly lacking, but the good food and prices make up for it!Aux Vivres is our go-to vege takeout spot.
I live the food here... I even crave it. I always have the BLT on chapati and the dragon bowl with tofu. I have seen this restaurant go from a small business to a full blown money Nanking restaurant. The I Lu thing that bothers me is that they are constantly raisin their prices... The food used to be made fresh and seemed to be made with live and now it seems to be mass produced and the quality is going down a bit. I will continue to go there until either the price becomes unaffordable or when I just stop craving the food. But I definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone even non vegetarian people can eat here and learn how to eat tasty healthy foods.
Interesting, healthy, delicious. Fun part of town
At a convention in Montreal and needed real food. The choices were overwheleming and as an all Vegan rest I was giddy! Ended up going back the second nigth too. The Tempeh Burger was great and tasty, the portabella burger was amazing too.   Carrot juice brought life back into my soul. I am grateful for place like this when I travel. Helps me survive the madness. Staff was great and service was perfect. Love love loved it
Terrible service and totally unoriganized. The waitress was randomly pick customer to serve instead of seating customer in order. The food is very average, but i guess there is really not much vegan places in Montreal.
Great vegan food, good service. I liked the soup du jour.  For true vegans, this is a real find, so I give it 5 stars.
Great all vegan menu. Attentive staff and bright environment.  Very tasty.
I was so excited to try Aux Vivres during my week in Montreal. My dad and I did takeout for an early dinner one night. Luckily there was no line and the service was quick and friendly. I ordered the BLT on their dark bread and a slice of carrot cake. The portions were surprisingly huge. The coconut bacon was delicious after the first couple bites, but then it made my stomach a little uneasy. Still the sandwich was tasty and I loved the mayo. The carrot cake was a little too moist and the frosting didn't look fresh, but it was still pretty good. My dad really enjoyed the vegie pate sandwich and he's not even a vegetarian! I wish I could have tried more of their interesting sandwiches/bowls. I'd definitely come back if returning to Montreal.
Amazing vegan food, can't say enough about it.  One of the few places in Montreal I can go to and know that I can order anything from the menu.  Excellent!
The ultimate finale for my Montreal visit.  After a day of wandering around the neighborhood looking at the hipsters, vintage shops, and record stores, we decided upon a recommendation to dine at Aux Vivres.  I was starving when I got in which was fortunate because having so many delicious-sounding things was too overwhelming (when I usually get to choose from one or two options on the menu tops) so we ended up ordering an appetizer, smoothie, and dessert to accompany our main courses.  The food was incredible, the decor was adorable, our waiter gamely answered all our weird questions, and we met a group of really nice Montreal-ans who were eating at the table next to us.  Totally worth the bill.
Ate here over the weekend, had the Le Complet, it was awesome.  Only gripes are that the service was too slow and their cheesecake was kinda vile.
Vegan vittles have never tasted so good as they do at this bright cheery cafe. I went here on my birthday after reading Yelp reviews and was not disappointed. The waitress told us that the recipe for the sauce on the Dragon Bowl was a secret and it wasn't hard to figure out why--it was amazing! It tasted like the love child of tahini, sesame oil and several other things I'd love to identify. With a pile of veggies and rice, it was a party in my mouth! We also tried a Thai peanut salad with tempeh, which was also delicious, and their "Tonique"--a blend of apple, lemon and ginger juices. This was probably the best meal I've had in a long, long time. Why can't making healthy choices always taste this good? I plan to try and replicate the dragon sauce and Tonique at home, but it's hard to imagine my own efforts would stand up to the amazing Aux Vivres. The rest of their menu looked as enticing as what we had. I'd probably be in danger of going here 2-3 times per week if I lived in Montreal. Happy birthday to me!
Very delicious, fresh, vegan, awesome food.  The service was very friendly, attentive, and really fast.  Not only is the food great, but there is also a variety of cool teas to go along with it.  Decent portions and again very fresh. Relatively inexpensive.  There's an awesome seating area ouside in the back.  Also, I discovered you can catch very fast WIFI in there, so if you're looking for sweet sweet internet you'll find it here as well.  CLOSED MONDAY.
The food here was good.  We started off with an order of cornbread, which I thought was fantastic.  I would never have guessed it was vegan if I didn't know.  The 'butter' didn't really taste buttery but I liked it.  I had a Dragon Bowl and my girlfriend had a veggie burger.  The dragon bowl was the better of the two.  I wish I had a chance to try the coconut bacon but they were all out that night.  Service was good, but the best part was that everything was pretty cheap.
Get everything.  Seriously, the food is outstanding.  The smoothies and juices are ridiculously good.  The soups and sandwiches are just amazing, too.  I forgot it was vegan.
Outstanding fresh, healthy food. The kind of meal you feel great after eating. Highly recommend for anyone seeking a salad or brown rice dish with a tasty sauce.
I have nothing but praise for my favourite little vegan hotspot on the Plateau - and Aux Vivres should not disappoint a grumbling (and earth-friendly) appetite. Their ingredients are super fresh, and I mean "crunchy" fresh. Salads are great. Also tried their pizza, which was served semi-warm but delicious nonetheless.. sometimes it's hard to believe they can substitute animal ingredients out and still be hearty - but they deliver. A+
The food is great! Get one of the sandwichs on chapati and take the second half home for lunch the next day. They are that big. Servers can be brusk with all the tables but are often cute. Always nice art on the walls.
a treat to dine at Aux Vivres. critiques: service is slow (but they are often very busy), their portions are huge and prices are on the expensive side. other than that, yum yum!
This place is literally tucked away in a basement.When you want a good sandwich, made the way you want it and not want to spend 15$ for it. You need to come here!The bread is crusty on the outside chewy goodness on the inside. The meats are fresh, and if you feel like having a little Pad Thai salad or spring rolls on the side, they have that too!Everything here is good, and the prices are amazingly reasonable, you can leave with a ham and brie sandwich, a soup, and salad for 10$.Please if you work in this area, look for this place and try it out! You won't regret it!!!!
This restaurant is interesting, and I like it!Basically you can get some general chinese food, wonton soup and an egg roll...or you can get a nice sandwich, with your choice of lunch meat ranging from turkey to pate to smoked salmon.  To accompany your sandwich you can add a salad, and you can even mix two salads.  The Clafouti just sales a little bit of everything...even hard boiled eggs!  You can walk out with a sandwich, a medium salad and a drink for less than $10.The food is good, quick and convenient.  I think they make their salads daily.  Highly recommend for those looking for a quick take out lunch around square victoria.
Locals love this place because it has fast service, cheap and pretty solid and healthy options. You come here just to pick up food, there is really not a place for sitting. most customers work around the area and come here for lunch during their break. Their prices are so cheap that is hard to believe for the area. My favourite: the sushi roll...Sandwiches are fine especially when you pay 3.5. Salad bar is pretty good too. Definitely best place for a quick lunch
I work right across this tiny little sandwich shop. It's pretty much my go-to place for lunch. They have freshly-made sandwiches, large selection of salads and a few asian fares like spring rolls, noodles (it's owned by a Cambodian family I believe). No fuss, delicious and CHEAP! if you cannot find the place, just look for the line of people waiting in line. Don't let that deter you, service is quick and efficient!
Decadent menu options and the service was lovely despite a packed house and one waiter. The plates coming out of the kitchen are gorgeous and tasty af. Thick slices of homemade bread and perfectly crisped potatoes. Good coffee too. Came for breakfast and kinda want to stay for lunch....
Fantastic little (literally tiny) spot! The coffee (I had a latte) is nothing special but the food was delicious. All plates are beautifully presented and well priced for the quality!. The portions are huge! The staff was friendly - a bunch of young girls working last weekend - however my only "negative" comment is that they spent most of the hour and a half we were there chit chatting and also talking to a group of their friends who stopped by, therefore not paying much attention to clients. Nonetheless, will definitely be going back to try some of the many brunch options we didn't get the chance to try.
Very pleased with this new brunch discovery. Came on Canada Day so the place was packed and we waited a while for food but the staff was super friendly and warned us there would be a longer than usual delay on the noms. They even brought us some freebie yogurts for our patience which is always a nice touch. French toast with bacon cheddar and fried egg was amazing as was the egg white scramble. Highly recommend for lovers of brunchness.
Best brunch in the area. Lovely place and a little terrasse very nice during the summer.
I've been looking for a foodie's dream place and I believe this is it. They make fresh bread and integrate various influences into there creations. I went there and got a pizza with proshuto  goat cheese and dandelion leafs! What I love about l'entre-pots is it's one of theses places where you can go to hang out on a Friday after work or grab a pastry for breakfast and every time you pallet will go for a ride.
Oh wow! This place is the bomb! Try their "pain doré"! Amazing!!! It's a small place, so if you really wanna go, reserve in advance! I was lucky enough to find some spots available.
Broad selection of good beer and decent pub food. The patio is excellent. It's a great place to sit outside and enjoy a nice summer afternoon.
I'm obviously not a beer expert, but I found the drafts quite tasty. My first glass, a Van der Bull  Belgian beer, was an easy-drinking light-coloured beer with notes of citrus. It had more personality than Le Cheval Blanc. For my second glass, the waitress recommended the café-vanille stout, a dessert beer that had an intense aroma of coffee liquor but easier to drink. It was lightly carbonated and un-bitter.The $12 salsa appetizer was nothing special in terms of taste but it was generous enough to share. $2 extra for guacamole that I'd skip next time. I found the terrasse setting and quiet location of the brewery pretty cool. So was our waiter Léonie who was very attentive.Again, not a beer expert, but for a recreational drinker, I found that there was enough choice to find something interesting.
One of the most known brewers of the city, aptly named "Brewery of Montreal". The franchise has three locations in Montreal, but this one, although far from the downtown core, is worth the detour. Located in Griffintown, once an industrial neighborhood now slowly gentrifying to the pace of the new stores being opened on its pedestrian streets. Accessible by transit from a short walk from the Lucien-L'Allier metro station, this bar also sits in a bike friendly neighborhood. The patio is locatedon on a street with little or no cars, near the Lachine canal--differs from the more noisy and busy other locations.Brasseur de Montréal is known for its beers: be warned that their food menu, somewhat extensive at first sight, is deceiving. I ordered a fish and chips plate whole my fellow Yelper got a plate of nachos with extra guac. Hips were soggy and I was surprised that the fish wasn't fried in a beer batter--after all, it's a brewery! Malt vinegar wasn't available, too. The nachos were as equally deceiving, and the extra guac cane with a $2 price tag...However, the beers made up for the ffood that we ordered only as finger food. Got the IPA and La Rebelle Québécoise, and they were as described: hoppy and slightly for the IPA, and light and refreshing, with a tart endtaste for the Rebelle. Pleasant beers for patio season!I only rated three stars because of the disappointing food, but will come back for the beers. A little surprised a brewery this well-known didn't have happy hour pricing and deals.
Brasseur de Montréal, is a brewery with bad beer. Forget the food, the location, and the staff. Brasseur de Montréal serves an exhaustive array of beers that are failures individually and collectively. This is harsh, but there is really no way around it. Stop making so many beers, and focus on making one beer good.... or maybe think about becoming a restaurant....
This is a really unique place.  The decor is great, the location is off the beaten path but in the middle of everything and the service was pretty good.  Mind you I have been here a couple times but only for beer.  Great selection but honestly . . . no 5-7 prices?  Typically its two for one or at least some sort of discount.  Even a buck off a pitcher or something.  I know a lot of people who say the same.  Add a deal ANY deal and customers would feel like they got great value and will maybe come more frequently ;)
This will now become my place for happy hours. Great beers, I was impressed by the various flavours. Loved their rebelle, orientale, and stout cacao beers. However, it was hard to finish their stout with absinthe! Anyhow, it was delicious with the poutine. Just got the classic. Even for a girl, the small portion was too small and would recommend the bigger portion that wasn't that much bigger. Otherwise the other meals had fair portions.
Good bar food and excellent IPA.  This was a great local place to check out on our vacation to Montreal.  Staff was friendly and fast, smoked meat poutine was delicious and the fish and chips was well done. We shared a pitcher of the IPA which was an excellent brew.
I was looking for a restaurant in the area and this one looked like a good choice...I really wanted the Mac and cheese after seeing the picture here on yelp, but it turns out they just changed their menu last week and they no longer make the Mac and cheese :(I ended up ordering the table d'hôte which was onion soup, grilled cheese with smoke meat, and pudding Chomeur. The soup was pretty good. My main meal seemed a bit cold...both the fries and the grilled cheese. The taste was pretty good, but nothing super special about it. For the price ($18) I thought it wasn't worth it. The service was pretty good though. The restaurant is big with a very simple and plain look to it...nothing really fancy or special about it either.
I had the stout beer, which was quite good. My partner enjoyed his brown ale, as well.  I had the Montreal style ribs, which were fall-off-the-bone tender and tasty.  My partner had a burger topped with pancetta and gruyere.  The burger was fantastic!  Prices were quite reasonable, too.
Great terrasse, nice beers and good selection and super friendly and helpful servers. The patio is dog-friendly and it shows...every single time I have been here, there's been at least 5 other dogs lounging about. The only reason why I am not giving this place 5 stars is because the food is pretty 'meh': the salmon tartare was kinda tasteless, bread was hard and the salads were nothing special.
I checked in with some clients for lunch fully expecting to wait hours to get my food as per previous Yelper reviews but was decently surprised on how quickly we were served by the friendly staff.Didn't drink any alcohol (work policy) but definitely had their smoked meat poutine. The poutine was a bit too salty but it was very good nonetheless with the portion being just right. The price tag was decent as well.Location is a bit out of the way but hey, my car was still there when I left, so that's always a good thing for this part of town right? :)
My second time here. Both times have been during the winter :( + I am not a beer person. The ambiance is cool, good music but the food has been so so. 1st time I had the cheese burger and I asked AND paid for extra cheese but could not even taste it. This time I took the grilled cheese and ham. (as you can see I  cheese) I had to take out some ham because it was too much and other then that......personally I think I can make a better grilled cheese at home. I think I will try one more try and if not....it will just be off my list of "go to's". My date did enjoy his beers very much. So if you are looking for a place with good music and different beers, come try over here.
Oddly situated in an industrial - feeling area with asphalt parking lots and chain-link fence, this is nonetheless a charming little brewpub and a place you can get a bite to eat. I stayed and had a number of the beers, some decent and overall I'm impressed with this place. Worth wandering a little bit out-of-the-way for something different.
Quaint (yet large) bistro for fantastic food!  Lunch was ridiculously cheap - delicious cabbage tomato soup, beef stew and dessert for under $20 per person!  Loved the environment and you can't go wrong with the food.
The ambiance is nice, albeit far from the city center, catering mostly to those who are around GriffintownThe service is slow during peak hours (lunch for example) but it seems it's more due to the popularity than any fault of the team really.The food is nice and nicely presented, and there are good choices.Didn't try the beer unfortunately, that'll be for next time
Good beer, good food, what else is needed on a late summer night.
Been there several times and I've always had good experiences. Staff is really nice. Food is great. Right price and excellent quality. Highly recommend!
A bit out of place,Extraordinary beer.Food's not worth raving.
Follow the recommendation beer-meal.
Montreal's obsession with food and beer is something that should certainly be a welcome thing. Brasseur de Montreal is no exception to this culture. Brasseur de Montreal does produce a few very interesting and unique creations. Milliseme, and Ghosttown certainly both standing out. The former, a bourbon barrel aged, and Belgian inspired choice.  Plenty of residual malty sweetness, and a high ABV makes it a pleasing, yet deceptively intoxicating choice. The latter, an Absinthe infused stout. The Anise flavor is forward, and notable, but not overpowering. Unfortunately, the rest of the selection is fairly tame. A Vanilla stout that is pleasing, a blonde that isn't phone home worthy, but enjoyable. The food, it's fine for a pub faire. My last meal wasn't the most memorable, but I enjoyed my time drinking, and have returned to do so again since. I have every intent of Brasseur de Montreal remaining in my choices for local breweries, I just wish I could see more of their one off options.
I went to the Brasseurs de Montreal last week with a group of friends to take advantage of the first warm terrace worthy night of the summer. Truth be told I've been here a few times before with about the same results every time.To start this place has a nice terrace, in the middle of Griffin Town. I'm not sure how many it can seat but it's allot since we were ten at our table and there were quite a few other tables with groups around us and we still felt like we were the only ones there.The service always seems to be a little slow but nothing too bad and since I'm always there with friends it's nice to have the time to talk. I would like the wait staff to be quicker with the first round drinks. I wouldn't suggest Les Brasseurs de Montreal if you're in a hurry but if your out for a nice night with friends  it's a fun place to be and you might not even realize that the service is a little slow.Being a microbrewery this place makes a full compliment of beers that will please any beer drinker. I must admit that I am not a big beer drinker but every time I come here I find a beer that I like, last time we shared pitchers of sangria and that was also good. The food is your typical pub fare with burgers, bavette, nachos and sandwiches on the menu. The food is OK the quality average, it really isn't bad but you wont rant and rave about it the next day. I realized the food here was nothing to write home about when the day after I couldn't remember what I'd had for diner. Nothing about Les Brasseurs de Montreal stands out but that's what I like about it. It's a nice neighbourhood spot where you can go grab a drink and something to eat with friends on a nice terrace or even inside when the weather is cold and if the company is good you're sure to have a good time.
Well the staff was very nice at first, they helped us with our strollers and got the kids the seats they needed.  The waiter was ok, but a little slow.  The food in my opinion was the best I had sandwich wise in Montreal.  This place kicked butt!! Its a pub dont get me wrong, but the bread on our sandwiches were so tasty and done just "Perfect" it made the roast beef sandwich stand out!! My salad was good, and the whole experience was pleasent since everybody liked what they ate.  Ex: Buffalo wings, nachos, chicken sandwich, etc.....We were a group of 10. This will be the first place I come back too when in Montreal.
had a lunch special here once with a small wrap and soup. really tasty and the coffee was also great too. the ambiance was also really nice; could see myself studying at the rear of the cafe and also just hanging out on those large tables they have. can't wait to visit again.
Crowded, OK. Must be a good cafe if it's packed, right? Just wait & see if the other people standing are all waiting for a table or take-out orders. Several orders came out in the ten minutes we waited, I moved to let waitress past, receiving a polite "Merci" on two occasions, but no offer of any information. No inquiry to either adult in our four person party. One of the reasons we'd walked the 1.4 km from the Parc Olympique down to this café was because the Yelp info included the classification, Child friendly. No sign of any staff member thinking at all about the possible needs of two hungry kids. So, twelve minutes or more of being ignored, you've not just lost that potential 'custom' but garnered a negative Yelp review to boot.
Montreal has been invaded by loads of independent cafes in recent years albeit HoMa still doesn't seem to have a wide variety of them yet.  Enter Hoche Cafe located on Ontario just east of Pie-IX and Promenades Ontario, which is the trendy part of HoMa.  It's massive and has plenty of seating.  It can get very crowded though especially on weekends.  Despite its size it has a cozy ambiance to it.  There are a few large, communal tables to sit at or smaller ones if you don't want to get to close to strangers.They always have a great variety of baked goods which are always fresh and generally well-made.  The banana bread I had on my most recent visit was very moist and there was a sizeable portion of it.  I must say though that I don't really like the coffee.  The espresso is much too sour for my liking.Pricewise it is on par for an independent coffee shop.  Some might say it is too expensive considering it lies just outside the trendy part of HoMa and I am inclined to agree.  If this were Mile End or the Plateau I might object a little less to the prices but we aren't in those areas.
Cute and cozy coffee shop in Hochelaga. Very friendly staff, mostly only french speaking. London fog (earl grey tea, milk and some sweetener) is delicious, la bicyclette (eggs - scrambled, bread and peanut butter) was not very exciting (egg a bit dry). The granola for the yoghurt was "just" a crumbled cookie (about 1 teaspoon full of it). Asking for more made us feel rude, and least that was the feeling they gave us. All in all, nice café, the pastries look very mouth-watering, drinks are great, other food was okay.
I have been to Hoche around 10 times now and I'm consistently a little disappointed each time I leave the café. The coffee itself is excellent, but the rest of the experience is so-so. For starters, the few plates of food I have tried so far were mediocre. The scrambled eggs served for breakfast are made in the microwave (in front of clients, so at least they're not trying to hide it) which I find hard to accept wen you're paying 11$ for eggs and a piece of bread and jam. The last plate I tried was the croque monsieur, and unfortunately it was also disappointing. The bread was not toasted and the cheese was hardly even melted (probably made in the microwave as well instead of the oven). The paninis were also so-so.The staff is usually polite, but definitely not overly friendly. I always bring back my plate and cup once I'm done with my coffee because I know how hectic it gets in popular coffee shops, and not once was I thanked or even just smiled at. Definitely not a common reaction in Montreal, where most staff is overly thankful towards this simple gesture. My recommendation: great coffee to pick up when on the go. Otherwise, have a bagel or a pastry with your coffee but avoid the meals.
Not in love. It's a regular coffee shop. I ordered  ginger espresso on a Monday morning and the staff was so rude. The coffee was way too bitter and tasted cold. Would not go back.
Was very excited to try this cafe out because of all the good reviews. A group of four of us walked in, took a look around and had no idea wether we were supposed to seat ourselves or wait to get seated. If we were supposed to be seated nobody greeted us. If we were supposed to seat ourselves the table we eventually sat down at was already "taken" by another group even though it was empty. So instead standing around like a bunch of idiots we left. Will probably try this place out again but for now not a good experience.
Just brilliant ambience for a breakfast place. We got here at around 830, and there weren't that many people around. So it was nice and quiet. Being quite far away from the city, might be a contributing factor to having some "local" clientele. No one spoke English but google translate helped us get the orders right. The food was good though the serving size was small for my breakfast liking. It was delicious nonetheless.
Very helpful and patient with us as we translated the menu...plus the food was great.
Great coffee, great sandwiches, cute little spot with a nice decor and great staff. I recommend the grilled cheeses- all extremely delicious. I mean this place has it all what else would you ask from a cute independent café in HoMa. Definitely worth going to after a little trip to Marché Maisonneuve (it's right across).
Perfect Internet cafe. The high speed internet is very high speed, the food is delicious and these sting is comfy but you can work. And the music is very pleasant, too!
Let's get right into it, I love this place! Staff are very friendly, the place looks alway neat and also always packed. It's the new era of HoMa and HocheCafé is ready for it. Casual ambiance, you've got your typical student, hipsters, businessman, writers and iPad enthusiast all waiting in line for a great cup of coffee. Depending on who's controlling the fancy machine you'll get a leaf or an elephant draw in the milk of your latte. Tastier than any Starbucks I've ever been to! Great variety of food from side dish to full meal. They even sell their own brand of coffee but it's never has good has the original. Its my go-to coffee house on my week-end days. Haven't tried they full meal yet, but the pastries are delicious. I'll keep coming here for a while and you should swig by for a cup!
Hoche is one of those rare cafes that makes you feel like you could move into the neighbourhood, because you can see your life revolving around a place like this. Swinging in and out of their door, drinking their coffee and eating their sandwiches. As well as drowning uni sorrows with one of their giant choc chip cookies while you study on their wifi. It's like when you meet a new guy who has no visible flaws, and so your mind gets a bit carried away thinking about your lives together.This. happened. to. me. with. this. cafe.Tasty food, friendly staff and vibe, unpretentious. No visible flaws.Now to get the metro back to my actual neighbourhood and step back into reality. There will be other great cafes, I know. But every now and again I will still think of Hoche and their great toasted sandwiches.
Really close to maisonneuve cegep and best latte! Such a nice coffee shop and the staff were kind and friendly! Had a quick diner and there's lots of plugs near the wall for those who need to charge their computer! The price is real nice (cheaper then starbuck and better coffee &tea !) and the parking isnt hard to find! Its cheaper then downtown too (1$/hour compare to 3$/h) totally recommended love it!
Best fresh pressed juice I had in a while!! Will definitely be back for coffee and food! Loved the vibe there as well!!
Very cool place to drink some good coffee!  :)
What a cute and cosy spot to set up "office" for a few hours. It's a large space for a coffee shop, the kind of place that's so warm that it fogs up your glasses when you walk in the door. There's a definite sense of neighbourhood at Hoche. Adorning the walls are community posters for events and a live music acts. There's groups gathering to chat, individuals pouring over books and others like us working away on our laptops. With big mugs of coffee or pots of tea perched atop large wooden tables, it's a spot where you can feel comfortable hanging around for a bit. Watch out for the trickly loo situation. The men's and women's bathrooms are separated. You'll see the ladies when you walk in the front entrance, and you'll see the men's when you are sitting in the back. There is clearly an icon on each door, but because they're not near each other, it's pretty easy to go to the wrong door. Offerings are of your run-of-the-mill varieties: lattes, chai lattes, teas, coffees. They also offer some baked goods for snacking. And of course, no neighbourhood coffee shop is complete without some solid wi-fi to surf on. Make sure you snag the code when you order your bevvie.
Hip coffee shop for Homa!  Seems like it replicated itself from all the other hip cafés. It has the token rough wood construction and a vintage desk for the coffee lids and sugar but the coffee is definitively third wave (metropolis coffee). I hear the brunch is great. I'll be back!
Very nice coffee and staff. Easy in English and cool music. Good A/C during heat-wave. Yes come and enjoy the vibe....
They definitely have THE BEST chai tea latte, it's very very rich with the perfect amount of spice!! omg!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My eyes opened so wide after the first sip like "What? We have a puppy for Christmas?" kind of surprise. Their baked goods sit on the counter all day, but are delicious. A cookie is $3 (tax included). Fantastic service!! The music is odd. Sometimes extremely quiet, sometimes loud. Since we were the only people talking, I felt SO BAD when the piano music is dramatic and quiet. It's like I'm giving an inspirational tear-jerking speech. Which leads me to conclude that this is a superb study spot! It is so quiet in the mornings, plenty of outlets all around the cafe.Friendly staff!
Kitsune is a small little coffee shop that located off of Prince Arthur.  They have coffee and tea beverages, as well as a small selection of pastries.  I tried their Chai Tea Latte, and it was served in a small glass cup.  It was creamy, not too sweet, and had a nice amount of foam, sprinkled with some cinnamon on top.  Service was super friendly, and there are communal high-tops to enjoy your beverages, do some work, or do some studying.  +chai tea latte+friendly staff+free wi-fi
An adorable little place in this cute part of town, it's decidedly casual with a large communal table and a few other areas for seating. It has a rustic charm. I got a coffee, which was brewed perfectly as well as a chocolate chip cookie. They actually had multiple types. They also had an assortment of muffins that were delicious. Great service and free wifi.
What a wonderful cafe.Everything you need: great espresso, minimal decor, quiet atmosphere, good wi-fi.. I could go on and on.Highly recommended as your new go-to for coffee in the  lower Plateau.
Love this café. It's very close to where I live and it's not so expensive. They have amazing rich coffee and their chai tea latte is to die for. I definitely recommend getting their chai tea iced. I'm very picky with chai tea lattes. I hate them at almost every café BUT Kitsune's! It's very rich and creamy. It's to die for, especially when it's iced! Even talking about it now makes me want to go and get it.... Ok I'm definitely going to get it.Oh, and the wifi is great and the café is visually appealing.As for the seating.. The chairs are not that comfortable and it gets crowded pretty fast. There is a seating area in the back outside so that's a plus. But laptops are definitely welcomed!
After seeing Yelp pictures of the cute cat stamps on the to go coffee cups, I thought that I'd have to check this place out.If you love coffee and often in the downtown area, then you'd want to check this place out.Ordered the Gibraltar and it was very good.  My friend ordered the chai latté and I think she liked it too.  Would have loved to order the cookies or muffins to eat but didn't feel like the ideal place to sit and chat here.  The front part of the shop has a long table but it was full of people with their laptops. It seems like a definite quiet place to study.We sat on the back terrace and it was quiet as well, but it was hard to have a conversation.  We preferred to face each other but how the seating is arranged, you are sitting next to each other.And yup, seems hipster in here.  Seeing the bike dock IN the store was cool too.
Kitsuné has a very "hip" atmosphere. They have a huge table and stools for sitting which allows you to share the table with others so you end up talking to new people. There's a huge signage in the bag which looks great. Haven't been in the backyard because I never visited during the summer. The ambience is definitely a 5-star.As for the coffee, I enjoyed my latte but it wasn't something that truly stood out. Therefore, giving it a 3-star.
I give them 2.5 because I don't really like their coffee - too acidic and sour tasting for me. The cafe itself is quite chic and has a cool hipster vibe that is characteristic of Montreal. Close to St. Laurent and McGill, you can find a lot of people working here at times so it might be hard to get a seat. The cafe is popular within the St Laurent Boulevard area, but I prefer Pikolo Espresso Bar on Parc Ave.
The wooden accents makes this cafe a great afternoon relaxing spot. I usually not a chai latte person, but the one they made here was not too shabby. I wish they had more seats though and more electrical outlets. That would make this a great study spot. If you browse around the back of the cafe, you'll find a hipster little corner with typewriters and books. Be sure to try their bake goods though!
great atmospher and awesome coffee!The selection of books speaks for itself as well as the cold brew coffee! Go there if you have the chance!
Beautifully designed space with a cool communal table. The soy latte I got was just right, and served in a small glass. The cookies looked delicious.
to catch up with my friend. after entering we realized that this café is too tiny for 2 girls to talk (girls often sound loud, right?)... but there were others having conversation so anyway we stayed there, which was right decision.coffee tastes bitter gooood. one of my favourite in mtl actually. interior decoration was so cool and fashionable. i was just wondering why their name is in japanese...its cute though.i will come back for their gibraltar and huge cookie, but try to stay more calm maybe.
High quality espresso drinks, nice decor and interior bike parking. Staff are always friendly. Not a ton of seating during the school year as it gets packed with McGill students pretending to study.
Had a show across the way at Petit campus and my friend suggested going to this place. So cute! Limited seating but they do fresh pressed juices as well. I had a latte and it was quite delightful. Loved the subway tile and vibe of this place. Kinda tucked away, just slightly off the main street with only a little coffee mug to mark it's spot. Didn't get to try any of their baked goods that people have mentioned but I would definitely come back, their coffee was the perfect pick me up.
Very hip spot, but despite that the staff is still kind and won't condscend you!  VERY stylish cafe, with excellent drinks.  I didn't try any of the snacks, but it looked like they had some pretty tasty cookies out for the customers.  I will say that it can be very quiet in there with everyone sitting at the table in the middle clicking away at laptops with heaphones on, and you will get some dirty looks from the patrons when you walk in if you're not "one of them".  Very cool spot, worth checking out if you're a coffee/espresso lover!
We ordered our iced americanos and saw that several people before us had gotten their drinks, and about 10 minutes went by and we didn't get our drinks. We had to ask the barista and he forgot about our drinks. Besides that, the interior is nice and the coffee was alright. Hopefully the baristas don't have a habit of forgetting people's drinks!
Awesome spot to get some work done and enjoy a good espresso. One of my favorite cafés in the city.
I'm always a sucker for really cute, swanky, and semi-hipster cafes...and Kitsune definitely fits the bill! :) We were wandering around Montreal and stopped by Kitsune for a quick pick-me-up. We had espressos and it was very delightful! Beautiful balance of a nice dark and bitter roast. Beautiful. They have a few selections of pastries available as well. The decor is very homey--with "Kitsune" spelt out in lights on the back wall and rustic/vintage, high swiveling wooden chairs.
Amazing coffee, superb ambiance, extremely friendly stuff. What else do you expect from a cafe?! Definitely my new fav place. Why?Not as crowded and smelly as Neve.Myriade doesn't have wifi. Kitsune does.Humble Lion's sour (edit: not anymore) espresso? Arts Cafe (on Fairmount) is little too far. (edit: plus have rude service)
Dropped in earlier this morning for a latté to go. Was welcomed with a smile by the staff, who catered to both French and English speaking customers with enthusiasm. They seemed to have yummy muffins and cookies but I wasn't hungry, so didn't get to try them. The space is pretty cool, with a high table and a world map hanging on the wall right behind. Lots of wood, with an industrial feel to the place. Crowd was kinda hip and good looking, but not pretentious. All in all, good value for your money - they make a good almond milk latté and it's also a nice place to sit down and relax, right off the Main.
Delicious coffee, great vibes. I always order latte, though I order tea sometimes. Too bad Kitsune doesn't offer a wide range of tea.Downside: It is usually hard to find a seat, many people bring their laptop to study there.However, great ambiance.
This was the best soy latte I have ever had on the entire east coast. They don't make iced coffee (although they can make an iced americano) but who cares. They use barista series soy milk and it's one of the few times I've gotten latte art with soy.Atmosphere is cozy, lots of people with laptops out, all sitting along one long communal table. Also, for american tourists: they accept credit card, unlike Pikolo down the street.
Great little shop. Funky and industrial. Very good coffee. Not the best in town but not far off.  They have decent seating areas and wifi also.
Hey Kitsune, firstly totally appreciate the awesome typography sign. Coooool. Also, cute Batista twin haircuts. Now that that's out of the way - solid coffee. Seemed like a library since just about everyone was on a laptop. Good magazine selection to read with your cuppa coffee. Wouldn't go out of my way for it but a goodie in the area.
*update as of end of 2015*love the shop, its decor and vibe but the coffee though. cold brew is great but not espresso based. its pretty classic in coffee notes so expect chocolate, caramel, toffee, molasses. not satisfying enough for me.the indoor bicycle rack is a nice touch (so no more need to hunt down a spot for your bike) as well as the terrace in the back that let in a really needed breeze of fresh air in one of those really humid day.anyway, great shop, ok coffee. shame
This place is ok, the ambience is nice and it's a good location but it can get crowded. They have a terrace but it's really small and can fit maybe 3 groups of people max. I also ordered an iced americano which the barista forgot about. People in front of me were all getting their drinks and eventually I had to go and ask about it. There was only one barista working but it wasn't very busy, hopefully it's just a one time thing!
BEST SPOT TO STUDY! I always come here to study during the day. It's pretty quiet and a small, cosy place. I love their decoration and the employees there are very friendly. It's a good spot during the day, as it closes early at night. I sometimes just wish Kitsune was bigger, but at the same time what makes it Kitsune is that its a small cosy coffee place.
I went this place not too long after they opened. It's border-line pretentious, but they have very good coffee to back up the attitude, so I'll let it slide.They have wifi, but only tall tables/stools. They're still good to do some work from, but I usually find those tables a bit of a hassle when it's really busy.
Little hidden gem.This little cafe is a real delight. Food/drink : The coffee is delicious and so was the tea. The pastries and cookies were also great. Everything is simple, but in this case simple is best!Service: the girl at the counter is very nice! Be a little patient, she's alone doing everything, so kudos.Ambience : very laid back, nice eclectic decor (blend of retro, rustic, zen). Don't neglect the little terrace in the back!
Atmosphere is cozy, coffee is great, service is friendly. If you haven't been here it's a must try.
Great little place on Prince Arthur, not too far from the Main. I love the decor - lots of wood with a minimalist feel but a great vibe. The coffee's great and they have a good selection of baked goods - my recommendation? The brownie. YUMMMMMMMMM!The price list is pretty good - you'll pay less for a latte here than you will at a Starbucks or Second Cup. A Chai latte + decadent brownie will set you back a whole $7. Not bad considering the brownie was huge. Service was nice. Will go back. Check it!
Been here twice. One of the tastiest Americanos I've ever had. So rich! Not sure what they're doing right. Free wifi and a fair bit of workspace. They just need more comfortable seats.
I was looking forward to trying out Kitsune because a friend recommended it to me as being the most amazing place to get a latte in Montreal. I stopped in and my friend and I ordered two almond milk iced lattes. Mine was made perfectly, and my friend got what looked to be milk and ice cubes. It seemed as though I got all of the espresso and she didn't get any. When asking about it (we ordered the same thing and they looked very different) he said they were the same. The lattes were $4 each and we ended up throwing my friends out and sharing mine. I'm giving the 3 stars for inconsistency in their product. However the guy working was so sweet we didn't want to make him upset so if it wasn't for him and the awesome atmosphere of Kitsune I would have given this place 1 star (which rarely happens with me)!
Cool spot... too bad the owners and patronage know it. Maybe I chose a bad day and time but this place came off as a bit pretentious. good coffee though.
LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.They have limited options for coffee, but this is fine because what they do have is delicious (except the chai latte - but that might just be my own personal taste). The prices are fair for an independent café and the staff is the best! It is a great place to study with GREAT music. I can stay here all day studying by the window:) It is also very quiet so it is perfect for someone wanting peace to do work or read.DON'T come here if you are with a loud group.
Very cute space with delicious espresso drinks. Super nice service in French or English!
Love this place! Great ambiance, great staff and unique, great-tasting coffee!
Absolutely outstanding.  The two guys running it when we visited were really friendly, genuine and down to earth.The muffins (sweet potato, apples, brown sugar, nuts) were amazing.  The yogurt with black cherry and granola was sublime and was made on premises.  We also ordered orange juice and watched them squeeze the fruits to make it.My cappuccino was excellent; my wife had peach-vanilla (?) tea which was also great.We rarely give 5 star reviews but this experience, the ambiance (check out the back room al fresco custom-made benches seating area), and the service made the cut.And - loved the 3D school map of the world hanging on the wall!
Great vibe and perfect location.   A combo hipster meets startup meets the rest of us kinda place :)
coffee is great, hits the spot for the Cali girl in Montreal winter here!!  sweet they have an indoor bike rack for winter.
Best cappuccino in Montreal! The space is very small but not cramped. Seems to be a student hangout/good place to study. Baristas were extremely friendly.
Great stuff, good prices.
Great coffee, all brewed to a high level of perfection. They were using beans from a Halifax roaster the times I went in. They have a nice variety of baked goods inside. The interior is quite pretty, with some cool magazines and stylish tables.
You'll get some of the best espresso in Montreal here. It's small, so not a great place to set up shop to do work or relax for ages, but great to grab a quick macchiato. After sampling the coffee at all of the (allegedly) best places in Montreal, it's clear that Kitsuné serves the best cup.
Definitely one of the places I miss most about the JTM neighborhood! My favorite is the beef lemongrass with a Vietnamese iced coffee. I keep meaning to try their bun buh wei because all the Vietnamese people seem to go their to have their noodles. Their sticky rice is also very good.It's also a great snack to bring to the movie theaters :P (especially if someone is blocking your view).
This all in one stop for crispy banh mi, perfect iced coffee and really good bun bo hue is one of my favourite quick bites. I've been coming here for a few years and got hooked by their banh mis. They also have curry and bun bo hue which was exquisite for a hole in the wall type of resto.What determines a good banh mi is all about the bread and sauce. The bread MUST be crispy on the outside and still soft and warm on the inside. The first bite should only be determined by the crunch of the bread and the flaky crust that falls on your shirt. I usually only get the grilled chicken and their Vietnamese cold cuts sandwich. They start by spreading the bread with their homemade Viet butter/mayo, a very thick layer I may add. They're pretty decent with the amount of meat they put in and it's never dry. They top it off with pickled carrots and radishes, cucumber and cilantro. Their sauce is thick and just the perfect amount of sweetness. They accomplished the balance of flavors in the sauce, the ratio of bread to meat and freshens everything up with the pickled vegs. Dont forget to try their ice coffee and bubble tea. This is definitely a place when I want something crispy as well as soupy. Ordering a banh Mi and Bun Bo Hue is always the way to go! If you buy ten sandwiches they throw in a free one, who does like free 99! I often get a banh mi for long road trips and it still stays so crispy and good after six hours in the car. I would definitely recommend this place for a good cheap bite!
We stopped by Marche Hung Phat to try out their Banh Mi after visiting Jean-Talon Market. There is always room for good food!There was a short line but it moved quite fast. Everyone was ordering Banh Mi to go and so did we! For $4 a nice Vietnamese sandwich is a good deal. The thing I enjoyed the most was the bun with crusty exterior and soft and moist interior.Love the pickled carrot and daikon toppings. Extra Thai chili please!I am not sure if Marche Hung Phat serves the best Banh Mi in Montreal but I can tell you that the one I had was excellent.Skip the Vietnamese Cold Coffee though.. it was meh....
By far the best place to come for Banh mi that I've found in Montreal. $4 for a delicious flavourful sandwich of crunchy fresh baguette and contrasting yet crazy delicious flavour. If you haven't had a Vietnamese sandwich you need to get your butt down here to try one. Stop eating subway or smoked meat.... Vietnamese subs are 10X better. I've come here twice in the last few weeks and my mouth is seriously salivating for more. Both my orders were for a B2. Get one....it's loaded with meat, veggies spicy small green peppers win mayo and Vietnamese pate and bacon. It's like an explosion of flavour in your mouth that is crunchy and delicious. The best way I can describe it is a loaded sandwich one of the best in Montreal hands down. If Banh mi is your deal you need to come here to load up your fridge. Great stuff folks. Only the best!
Best bahn-mi in Montreal. Worth the visit. You will be back. I order B1 with no sauce and extra hot peppers. The best!!!
I drive from from decarie and the 40 to get me some of that delicious bahn mi.The flavors are fantastic, the price is right. Call in advance for big orders (I usually grab between 20-30 of them for the guys at work, they all trip out over these magic sandwiches)
Food should be eaten when it's fresh. That means most pizza's should be enjoyed at the shop, take out Chinese should be the exception rather than the rule, and restaurant meals should be completed at the table whenever possible.Banh mi actually travel quite well, especially when packed properly. This place separates the vegetables from the meat, so that when you reheat the sandwich in the oven (350 F - for 10 to 15 minutes) they don't wilt.The thing is that I live hundreds of miles away, so when my delivery of sandwiches came, they needed a bit of TLC to be brought back to life. If the decision is between fresh banh mi from upstate New York, or a slightly aged sandwich from Marche Hung Phat, I'm going with the imported sandwich every time.What a delicious treat. I had the number one with ham, cha lua, and pate. But this has everything going on. Let me see if I can capture it. Crispy crust, tender crumb, meaty ham, funky pate, creamy dressing, crunchy cucumber, sweet pickles, hot pepper, warm bread, cool veggies, and all of it was in a gloriously harmonious balance. To really get a true sense of the place, I have to get up to Montreal and try several of their freshly made sandwiches. But I'm such a fan, that I could not resist the chance to weigh in on their banh mi excellence. Thanks to all of you who bring me delicious things from all over the world. I'm very lucky indeed.
Love love their Vietnamese subs. They're so good and cheap! They also have a variety of ready made foods that you can grab for a quick meal. They also have a few grocery items available to purchase as well. Great for cheap eats!
I love Banh Mi sandwiches and I was recommended this place which is conveniently located at the corner of Jean-Talon / St-Denis. Once you walk in, on your right you pass by a long SUPER SHINY table where patrons can enjoy their food. On your left is an open fridge area where you can pick up your desired drink, dessert and so forth. On the far right there's a deli counter where you can order your food and watch it get prepared for you in front of you. Just make sure to pay attention during the preparation and not share my fate.I went with their #1 Banh Mi sandwich and overall it was pretty good. For a mere $4 you have this huge beast of a hoagie with the ingredients you want . The bread was perfect, the ingredients were fresh and it would have been a solid 4 star experience... if the person who did my sandwich understood correctly that I did not want my Banh Mi to be spicy. NO SPICY? MO' SPICY? Being someone who's not a fan of spicy and would much rather taste the sandwich for what it is... I felt the spiciness diminished my BANH MI EXPERIENCE! (-1).All in all, I may try again... one day.
my favorite banh mi joint in town. well, the one i go most often to as i live nearby.the banh mi are dirty cheap, simple and really good. i always stick with the regular or the gelatinous pork one and always always get it with extra thai chili because i need that spicyness in my vietnamese food.besides banh mi, they serve soups too but its more of an afterthought. and they have a cold prepared food section where you can get cured pork, che (pudding) and other stuff. i don't bother with that section since i can always ask my mom to call her contacts and get it straight from the source so you know its as fresh as it can be like right off the stove fresh ;p
Just a bright little window ledge with a few seats, a counter where you order, and a few shelves of vietnamese snacks and dried soups, some fridges with prepared foods. The best Bahn Mi in the area, and there are some good ones. The chicken curry noodle soup is nice too especially on a rainy day. The service is friendly and smiling and things are made fresh for the most part. A great spot to grab a sandwich before a picnic in the park.
Awesome banh mi! They also make great bubble tea, which is hard to find (good or otherwise) in the area!
Discovered this place in my neighborhood not too long ago and have been going back on a weekly basis. Please refrain from going to the Subway next door and try this type of sandwich instead. Best banh mi in town. Price/Quality ratio unbeatable. Lots of variety. I even treated  my co-workers to some recently because I just HAD to share the joy. Yummy!
Great banh mi, reasonably priced. Soups are not bad either. Majority of the customers are Vietnamese, which gives the place a bit of "authentic" feel.
The marinated pork banh mi (bì) was pretty good but I wish they were a little more generous on the vegetables and on the meat. The flavours were nice but the quantity of stuffing compared to the bread could be better.
My new place is across the street from this joint, and when we signed the lease we were very excited about being so close to our FAVOURITE Vietnamese sandwich shop in Montreal.They know their stuff. Not much more to say but good sandwiches, casual atmosphere (you order, pay and receive your food at the counter, unless you get a soup or something, and then you can stay and eat at their tables or take it to go). Super affordable (all sandwiches are under $5). My favourite is the tofu. YUMMMMM.They close at 7pm.Update: I've gotten sick from the pork ball sandwich twice, unfortunately. That one is like playing Russian roulette.
Banh mi! I am not vietnamese but i love vietnamese food. I've tried so many in town for many years. A lot opened and a few closed but this one survived because its the best in town.
They have a lot of variety of sandwiches! When I first tried it, I was a little bit disappointed by the beef sandwich. However, that happens to any place with plenty of variety: you like some and you hate some. I came back for the original sandwich, and it was like the one I ate all my childhood. Really good. It's also very cheap, going for 3,50$ each. They also do it in front of you, all customized and very fast service.
Food: Only ordered the donut, I'm sorry but Tim Hortons cannot compare. Before eating digging in, the faint scent of chocolate filling is already to die for~ One bite is sufficient to conquer you! Perfect crunchy outside but soft and tender inside, with the liquid chocolate filling, not overly sweet but enough to fill your whole mouth with an explosion of chocolate taste, hm... I'm salivating again now...Service: Staff are super nice and fastValue: A little overpriced (like most food trucks)...
Some sweet lady from my hood arranged for the food truck to arrive on the last day of the local organic produce market. There is some kind of irony in that as I wouldn't associate the food of Au Pied de Cochon with organic and healthy, nor I would recommend it to vegeterians. Would I recommend it in general? Oh, yes! Must try!It has been few years since I visited the actual restaurant and my memories of it were kind of blurry. The foie gras poutine of the food truck brought back immediately the flavours of that dinner. The size of the poutine is decent for a food truck as well as the size of the foie gras in it. What makes the dish unique is the foie gras gravy, it is just delicious. We also shared le verrat à l'érable, battered pork sausage soaked in maple, which was really good and filling. The maple soda went well with the food. Conclusion I'm quite happy with my PDC truck experience and will do it again!
The Camion Au Pied De Cochon was parked at Dorchester Square when I saw them.  We ordered some fried pork rinds (skin I guess) dipped in a ranch flavour and some foie gras poutine.At first I really liked the pork rinds as it tasted like greasy but saltier sour cream and onion rings.  I always had a weakness for those when I was younger. However after a while, it got tired and too salty for my liking.  As for the foie gras poutine, I was not a fan of it at all.  Too heavy and rich for me.  I know that's the purpose of this restaurant, but I couldn't even have 4-5 bites. On the bright side though, is that it was reasonably priced as both dishes were under $8.50.Verdict: If you like greasy, salty food, you'll like it.  If you don't and prefer your food a bit less adventurous, then I wouldn't recommend.
After a disappointing experience at the actual restaurant I was quite pleased when the food truck lived up to the hype associated with Martin Picard's food empire.  This particular food truck is split up into two parts, savoury goods and sweet goods. One of the star food items is the famous foie gras poutine.  Prices are in line with the other food trucks in the city.Braving the crazy line-up at First Fridays I was lucky to get my hands on some of the last foie gras poutine they had.  Ever tasted something that felt so wrong yet so right all at once?  Wrong because it is so heart-attack inducing but right because it is just too delicious to pass up.  That sums up foie gras poutine.  The fries were very thick and crispy and there was just enough gravy so that they didn't get too soggy without sacrificing the taste.   There was also a good amount of cheese curds and the foie gras added a nice touch to the poutine.The portion was a little small but maybe that's best for my arteries.  The line up was insane too compared to the other food trucks there that night.  My friend and I waited two hours and like I said before we got some of the last foie gras poutine.  Those behind us who had waited the same amount of time weren't going to be so lucky.  It might be best not to visit at First Fridays but the rest of the time when they're out and about.
Finally a better outlet for their foie gras poutine than its destination restaurant, APDC's poutine is priced just right at $8 per portion. I've had orange-gravy-shredded-mozz poutines for more than $8. Not typically being a fan of fancy poutine, the (large amount of) foie gras complemented well the noticeable saltiness of the gravy. The presentation was great, easily one of my favorite fancy poutines ever - not that I'd have it every day. ** Seriously, who reviews a food truck called Au Pied the Cochon for its bottle water price? Next, go review airplanes bathrooms for the comfort of their seats.
Sausage in a brioche, with foie gras sauce and grilled asparagusOreilles de crisse with Ranch saucePoutine Foie grasDr Pepper w/ maple syrup.The sausage was wonderful and the brioche was a nice change from your standard buns. The grilled asparagus was perfectly cooked but there was some stringiness that made cutting though it a bit of a sport. This caused a bit of a structural failure that made eating the sandwich a fun and messy affair. The poutine was too salty for my taste, there being even a bit of salt burn on the tongue. The foie gras on the poutine however was a brilliant and soft counterpoint to the saltiness, as was the hyper-sweetened soft drink. The Oreilles de Crisse were light and crunchy so texturally they were fun but again it was another experience in "too much". Deep fried fat will tend to do that.I don't know if I want to fall asleep or just curl up in a corner and have myself a heart attack. 4 stars. Would do this again.
The truck was parked in Place du Canada. I normally do not wait in lines as there are usually other comparable choices available, but I made an exception and it was definitely worth the wait. I ordered the foie gras poutine and the donut. The poutine was succulent and wish I had a bit more but the winner is definitely the donut. My only regret was that I didn't order it with cheese. Definitely worth the price and the line!My experience at the truck was definitely better then the one at the restaurant, which I had high extremely expectations, which may not have been realistic.
I feel terrible saying this, but this did not live up to the hype. The foie gras poutine was OK, good sauce, except the liver didn't seem to be fully cooked (at least not compared to the foie gras I had before in Quebec.) The beignet was good, the homemade iced tea excellent. Still the poutine should have been the star of the show.
a 5 star food truck? Only in Montreal :)The Au Pied de Cochon food truck serves heart attack on wheels. It's the best and most delicious way to live if you ask me ;)Beigne Cochon - My partner downed this in 5 seconds. Succulent and juicy said he.Poutine Foie Gras - I have to be honest, watching this dish swimming in oil was a bit of a turn off. then i had more, and more, and more, and I cant eat anything else after it but I swear to god I cant stop thinking about it now.Floater- Strawberry Soda with Ice cream. Oh drool. So sweet so thick, so yummyBeigne Fraise - Ok this here, for me, is the piece de la resistance, This is Beigne filled with soda au fraise. Please hold me while I drool myself to sleep thinking of this beaut.*Obviously don't go here if you don't like sweet, fattening delicious food. And yes, you are likely to get a heart attack or lose 5 years of your life. as long as I can eat those beigne fraise, I'm IN!
mind you, i really stay away from PDC and their truck as their food is really bad for me but this weekend, i learned they were offering some apple related items and a tourtière at jean-talon market in collab with verger villeneuve.so here i was standing in front of their truck looking at their menu and pondering if i should or not. walked away to only say screwed it and came back and ordered the combo which is fried jalapeno poppers (stuffed) and a maple apple glaze thick slice of bacon stick ($5) and a side of apple sauce filled maple glazed donut ($3)the donut wasn't bad. the thick maple glaze was really sweet while the apple sauce was just right. the glaze hid the hole away so if you bite on the wrong end, squirty squirt of apple sauce everywhere! at least, i had a fork so i wasn't caught off guard.as for the poppers and bacon stick. OMG! the slighty spicy hot jalapenos and the sweet sticky bacon. great flavor contrast that made me almost get a 2nd serving. for $5, hard not to.for that alone, its getting that rating otherwise, i'm very on the fence about them
I know the point of this truck is to serve over-the-top made-on-a-dare fatty dishes, but this is too much. This is food that is more fun to talk about than it is to eat. It's the conceptual art of food trucks.We had the Dumpling Sandwich, the PDC 2000 and the foie gras poutine. The Dumpling sandwich was OK, nothing memorable, mostly greasy and salty. The PDC 2000 sandwich was filled with delicious tongue pastrami, but the "bun" was an abomination. Might as well serve the dish in a bowl of warm melted cheez whiz. The foie gras poutine was the lesser offender with its perfect fries and interesting gravy, but the foie gras was undercooked. All in all, the truck didn't make me want to visit again.
This is only regarding the blueberry beignets. It was 1 for 2.50 or 6 for 10, thus we got 6.It was super duper sweet and tasted basically like any fast-food donut filled with blueberry jam. My dentist would not approve =(Wish they still had Foie Gras poutine... the guy said it may come back mid 2014...
There was a poutine à la foie gras and other meat products. Being a vegetarian, I can only review the beverages. The water but a bit overpriced,I would just to a fountain instead ....The water is the only thing I would want when I am on Mount Royal.  The camion au pied de Cochon  should take into consideration that it is mostly health conscious people that hang out at the mountain.  Mount Royal 3$ for water versus Central Park  1 $ ,water  me think not I will come again
I'll keep it short: raw foie gras on my foie gras poutine? Hahahaha, hell no.A waste of time (long lines) & money.(I still love the actual restaurant mucho though)
On the opening day of the project, I had the chance to head to Victoria Square to try out Camion Au Pied de Cochon. Now I realize that this will be the 4th post I write about Au Pied de Cochon and its various off spring. The reason is quite simple... I love them that much! The concept they are going for is salty and sweet. You order in the front and from there, you pick up your items from either the salty window and the sweet window. The menu is an blend of dishes from the Duluth restaurant, the Sugar Shack and some unique truck items. I went for their big combo option with an added item. That item was a fried duck leg with maple syrup BBQ sauce. Anyone who went to the Sugar Shack this past spring got a taste of this particular item. Nice tangy BBQ on top of some great duck. Nice crispy exterior while still keeping some moistness inside. Great option for only 3$!The combo box itself contained four times - a maple soda, a foie gras poutine, a "beigne Cochon" and a "beigne sucré". The maple soda was nice and refreshing with just the right amount of maple syrup flavor to make it sweet but not overbearingly so. This was one of the components of the Whiskey Soda I had up at the Sugar Shack.... Still the best one I have ever had.Next up, the foie gras poutine - their old restaurant classic and signature dish. If you've had it there then you know what to expect. They succeeded in translating perfectly to the food truck. Crisp golden fries, cheese curds, a piece of foie gras and their foie gras gravy - perfect in the restaurant and perfect here.Now for the new stuff. The "beigne Cochon" really stretches the definition of a doughnut. In reality, this is a smoked meat sandwich where a doughnut is the bun. Yeah.... You read that right... A doughnut bun. Picard and his team are just nuts man. Anyway, this sandwich was amazing. A very generous portion of pork smoked meat, white ham and pork tongue with some mustard sandwiched in between that doughnut. Great combination as the doughnut mimics a sort of brioche bread. Nice and golden with a good crust yet a soft interior. The perfect way to differentiate themselves in this food truck rush.For the "beigne sucré", they take the exact same doughnut but then stuff it with a filling of your choice and then add powered sugar. In my case, I went for the rhubarb option. Stuffed to the gills with a cream and rhubarb filling, the doughnut, which had been perfect for a sandwich, became a wonderful sweet treat to cap off the meal.A very strong entry to the food truck world by the Au Pied de Cochon crew. Keeps in line with their "go big or go home" style of food all while adding some new twists for the truck. Very generous portions at a reasonable deal overall I think. If this is indicative of what we can expect from this generation of Montreal food trucks, we will all be very lucky people.Cheers!
Really good food.I tried their foie gras poutine even though I don't like foie gras at all, I thought it was well made. Tasted very fatty and greasy, just the way it's supposed to be.I also tried a bite of their Beigne Cochon, and it does taste really good. Moist, and just... you just finish that in literally 5 seconds.Must visit if you can in the future.
Dont forget the gravol after you have that. We were 5 to have it and 2 of us vomited, and it was just sitting on the stomach of the others all day. Very very overrated and expensive for nothing
A-ok. Portions a little small, the gravy was cold (cheese did not melt either) and the beignet Cochon too greasy. Bonus points for the concept however. Good flavours though, might have been an "off" day.
We ordered one of everything that was left to split for dinner. The poutine with foie gras was decadent (small portion, small price). The duck was just wonderful. The pork bun (beigne) was absolutely delicious! The only down point was the rhubarb doughnut that tasted more of apple than rhubarb. Service was with a smile and quick. We'll be hunting this truck again and again. Martin Picard does it again.
Very good eats!
Solid brunch!We tried to go to L'Avenue which apparently had rockstar reviews on Yelp but the line was winding around the corner and we were bordering "hangry."  I have never been one to wait for hours in a line to eat acclaimed food; though I consider myself a wannabe foodie, I cannot tell the huge difference between five star-wait-3-hours food and four star-don't-wait-but-still-damn-good food.  There are diminishing returns at a point. Anyway, we wandered into this place, which is cavernous and huge.  Sort of maze like layout which makes me think it was built and then added on to over the years.  Casual tavern type atmosphere.Told to sit anywhere we like so settled by a small table near the open porch (the porch itself was packed on this fine July day). Tried to decipher the menu with my high school French and settled on the 2 egg breakfast. A steal for Montreal.  2 eggs over medium, a generous helping of fresh fruit, toast, country potatoes and bacon, coffee, and OJ for something like 8 bucks. Totally refueled us for our marathon trek up Mount Royal and back around town for the rest of the day. Friendly service with no pressure (almost wish there were some pressure) to pay the check (which you do up front). Most customers appear to be locals, French speaking.  I recommend this place if you're looking for a friendly local place for pretty standard brunch fare at a more than reasonable price and don't want to wait hours for the gourmet stuff.
Good service and large quantity of food for the price. The ingredient quality was lacking a bit and service fell apart at the end.
It's a good restaurant for breakfast in Montreal  though it can be much better. The blueberry crèpe i had wasn't extraordinary with frozen blueberry.   And there was no french toast on the menu ( it's really a must for a breakfast restaurant in Montreal!). And there were just a tiny quantity of maple syrup with the crepe (try Universel restaurant on Peel street for french toast and lots of maple syrup!).The service was ok but they don't fill our coffees and i had to ask for a refill to have more coffee.Not bad but you can find much better breakfast restaurants in Montreal !  Bon un restaurant de brunch sur le plateau, disons que je n'ai pas été émerveillé par la qualité de la nourriture, bonne mais plutôt ordinaire, j'avais commandé une crêpe au bleuets elle était bonne mais les bleuets était clairement surgelés. De plus il n'y a pas de pain doré un incontournable et vous avez droit à seulement une petite quantité de sirop d'érable (essayer le restaurant universel rue peel pour du sirop d'érable à volonté, de l'excellent pain doré ainsi que des toasts fourni avec le repas). Et le service est ordinaire il devrait laisser du café en quantité suffisante sur la table si les serveuse ne passe pas régulièrement au tables car j'ai du demandé d'autre café.Pas mal mais loins de la qualité des autres endroits à déjeuner à Montréal.
Thanks for yelp, I found this awesome brunch place on my last trip in Montreal.Great brunch menuFrench menu ONLY, staff speaks EnglishEverything is good on the menuSpacious, no wait Worth the visit if you are in MontrealHighly recommend !
The way French brunch should be. The way all brunch should be. New Yorkers think they know brunch. I thought I did too. Then there was this. This is a game-changer. Like brunch itself is a game changer.You need more game.Eggs Benedict. Fresh OJ. Beautiful people. This place should be a song. Who has Pharrell's number? More stuff.
Maybe I'm the odd ball out if everyone gave it such high reviews but I really wasn't impressed. There was nothing healthy to eat on the brunch menu so opted out for a coffee instead (which was not fantastic). The service was super slow. For the people who did eat at my table, they were not too impressed either. I wouldn't go back
Came here for breakfast on a Wednesday morning. This place is in the Plateau district and is heavily French-speaking. Regardless, I managed to order a benedicts dish and it was really tasty. I'd come back again. Recommended.
Went there during a break between client visits. Food was good, waitresses were nice.I loved the bathroom wall hehThe place isnt fantastically designed but it has character..
There is something both pretty and ramshackle about La Petite Marche (watchout for that small step) with it's narrow, romantic wooden terasse on St Denis, wooden details, successive rooms opening with columns, theatrical inner space, cozy corners with benches... Directly across from the National Theatre School and full of food and drink at fairly student-friendly prices, La Petite Marche often hums with the young, focused, inspired energy of a highly competitive arts school.The plates are bountiful, bright, fresh and filling, perfect to sit and graze on through from breakfast to afternoon. The menu is several pages of fairly standard Quebecois cafe food done with heart and a big spirit. Tasty on several levels.
The brunch plates were big and beautiful but we experienced very poor service (part of our meal was forgotten and our food arrived lukewarm). I'd probably give this place another chance...eventually.
Really not a huge fan. I've been here 3-4 times. Each time I'm a little underwhelmed. There's just nothing that stands out that I can comment on. Nothing's bad, don't get me wrong. I just can't give it 4 stars. The building itself is super weird. Have a good look around. Everything's been built and renovated by an amateur. Electrical plugs without covers, unfinished ceramics, holes in the drywall, etc... The owner has no attention to detail. It's been the same for years now! Everything feels like an unfinished project.
I used to like to go to La Petite Marche for breakfast, but in the past year or so, I started thinking that there are many better places to go. I think the quality of the food went down in the past year or two. Although their breakfast deals are pretty cheap, it gets quite expensive if you order items à la carte, and the quality of the food is disappointing. The baguette bread is not real baguette :( and the rest of the food is just OK, no more. Espresso drinks are fine, though. The place is quite big, so it's a good option for groups that are not too picky about the food. The bathroom downstairs has such a strange setup (two toilet bowls side by side in the same room?!). The decor is nice, and if you get to sit on the patio or near the windows, you can enjoy the light outside. Whenever my friends ask me to meet up with them at that place, I go eat there... but I won't be the one who picks that place for breakfast.
Meh. You get what you pay for, I guess. Average food for a cheap price naturally draws huge crowds for the Sunday brunch... But honestly... They even decided to put tables in the basement to accommodate more people...The service is always fresh and pretty but also hit or miss :)
One of the best breakfast places in Montreal. Cozy , cute & lots of natural light in or a cute patio for the summer . Fast service. Often packed . Go early
So I was looking for a good brunch place near the Le Plateau-Mont Royal area, and Yelp led me to this place. Let me just say that the portions are HUGE. For around $18, including tip, you can get a hearty breakfast of eggs, toast, potatoes with herbs, a bowl of fruit -- cantaloupe, honeydew, pineapple, strawberry, grapes, oranges (more fruits than I've eaten in a loooong time), sausage, bacon, smoked salmon, a coffee, orange juice, etc. And this is just one order. The food was all well-done, but rather unremarkable overall. But for the value, it simply cannot be beat. Service was cordial and attentive. No complaints -- the food was well-executed, just nothing particularly exciting. Overall a solid brunch spot.
Excellent brunch.  I had the crepes with cheese and mushrooms, with a side of great fresh fruit.  Everyone at our table was quite pleased with their selection.  Great setting and good atmosphere.  Lots of seating available, so good for groups.
This is probably my favorite breakfast place in Montreal. Food is fresh, yummy, colorful, i just really love it all. I used to work around the corner so I grabbed take-out at least 3-4times a week, sometimes for bfast, lunch or dinner. As good as it gets.
Went there twice - Once for drinks, once for lunch. Staff is nice. Beer is cold. food is good.
awesome! love love it
Short trip to Montreal and this place was recommended to us by a friend/local.  The service was nice and the food was very tasty.  Kindof exactly what you want from a Montreal brunch.
It's going to feel awkward standing in one doorway after another, feeling in the way of busy servers looking for somebody, anybody to tell you where to sit. You'll be tempted to tap someone speeding by with a tray in their hands to ask for a hostess in  what feels like three big houses stitched together to make the restaurant that is La Petite Marche. Worry not weekend bruncher, they see you and they will get you tucked in at a table so you can have a long, leisurely brunch consisting of so many wonderful flavors - just for you. *If you can talk your way into the skylight room do it - great light and adds to the whole experience.Lots of menus will be handed to you, look for the brunch menu. Order some crepes that come with (deep breath):Eggsbaconhamsausagesauteed mushroomsbaguettefresh fruitmaple syrupcoffeeNo kidding. Sound like too much? Mais non. Just a little taste of everything on your plate. It's sooooo good.Noise level can be a little high, it looks difficult to maneuver a stroller through and tables can be pretty close together.The food is completely worth it. Bring a friend to catch up with and enjoy this hidden gem.
Reviews are all right.  Great wait staff.  Great Food.  No matter what you order, whether it be crepes or an omelette comes with fresh fruit, bacon, sausage, ham, potatoes, bread, eggs.  all very fresh too.  strong recommend.
I have fond memories of La Petite Marche because I was taken here by an old friend before I had even moved to Montreal. We were seated outside on their lovely little terrasse and I was perusing the menu with difficulty. After all, it was in francais, and I am, much to some people's dismay, a whole lotta anglophone. As I people watched the babes passing by on a lovely summer day, my cafe au lait soon arrived and it was the size of my head. Glorious! Thankfully, after consuming this delicious brunch bevie, I still had room for my ginormous breakfast. Holy moly...eggs, fruit, meat, toast...it's goodness all over the place! Since my first encounter with LPM, I've returned many times...to sit outside and enjoy the lovely weather, or inside to adore the gorgeous artwork that adorns the walls. It's really quite a beautiful spot on the bustling street of St. Denis where happy people succumb to the age-old dilemma of eating large amounts of food because their eyes are simply bigger than their stomachs. And, amen to that!
Very cute restaurant on Saint-Denis, perfect for breakfast or lunch.  Large indoor seating area, and quaint little patio, perfect for sitting on a nice sunny day.  The food is quite good, and served in very large portions, and at prices that are easy on the wallet.  The service from our waitress was excellent & friendly.  This place is probably worth 4 and 1/2 stars - check it out!
Great place for breakfast. A bit loud though.
Holy delicious! Great espresso, great vegetarian breakfast selection! Really cool atmosphere. You should definitely eat their crepes.
j'adore la petite marche! the food is tres delicious, and everything on ur plate is fresh and full of flavor. gets really busy on the weekends, but the wait is worth it. the staff is usually running around and sometimes hard to get a hold of but only cos its so busy. the patio (though tight) is wonderful to sit at on a warm day, but the sunroom inside is equally nice. lots of variety on the menu, mainly eggs bennies, crepes and omelettes. portions are huge, and they come with a lot of sides: sauteed mushrooms, seasoned roasted potatoes, bacon, ham, sausage, fresh fruit, foccacia toast! and the most perfect poached eggs! around $16 per average with coffee/tea/juicemust try: poached eggs on foccaccia with smoked salmon :)
On Monday for lunch, this place was packed! Food is served authentically French with nice presentation.
Great food, right size portion, and good service. I tried the chicken souvlaki plate with Greek salad. Quite the standard kind of souvlaki you can find anywhere else. Customer service is superb, but they only take cash!
If you're looking for fine dining, then this place is not for you and you would probably  have to look away ! This place has been here for a very long time and for that I give major respect to be open for that long and still bring in the money. To my surprise, they really charge cheap for everything. It definitely is a low quality kind of generous resto. Plates are very generous but poorly executed.The atmosphere: it seems like a late night diner and reminds me like a dunn's famous but way lower than dunn'sThe food: I ordered the trout filet in a combo. Everything but the main star of the dish "the actual fish" was good. I mean the fries, the rice and salad were delicious. The trout was extremely salty and dry! I felt the chewy dry fish and wished there was some flavour or tenderness. What a shame to see that fish die for me but it did not do any justice. What a useless sacrifice :( hahahaThe fries however were one of the best I have ever had in all Montreal. The Service: was fantastic. I can't complain. I had my meal prepared very quickly within 5-10minutes.The lady was very nice and calm. She really seemed to want to please me and take care of my order quickly.Overall, it's a cool late nice place!! I swear if I come again the next time Ill only come here for the fries lolol. They are the best I've ever had!!' It's definitely worth it!!!
I have to say that the place got worse over the years. The plates and the cutlery have stains on them, the ketchup tastes weird, and even the water sometimes has little bits floating in it.On the bright side, they offer very big portions of food for reasonable prices. The breakfast is the best deal, a huge plate for only 2$ + tax (although it used to be 1$). They also offer an series of poutines which all taste great and really fill you up, however they make take over 30 minutes to arrive sometimes, which can be a letdown.
Food is great and inexpensive. The highlight is obviously the 2$ breakfast which is a pretty good amount. However, there are other strong points for this restaurant. The roast chicken is very tasty and is barely 10$, huge portion. The fries in my opinion are great, must try the poutine once. Overall i'd say you cant find this quality of food for the same price.
I wish I could give 3 1/2 stars here. This location is definitely a solid spot for a good meal. Don't expect American portions but expect an affordable plate. Past reviews boast of a 1.99 breakfast, my guess is that this is something that you must ask for because we didn't see it on our menu. Actually the waitress asked us for our order before we even saw the menu. The yelp site states that this vendor accepts all major credit cards; this is not the case, please bring cash.
Best breakfast for a looney!So much better than an overpriced brunch ! (Like legit 10x more expensive) The portion in my opinion is decent (like something you would pay 5$) but still happy with it ! Or theres a bigger brunch set that is 4$ (i think they add 2 more pancakes).I went there 3 times and never got disappointed because nothing changed !
People who lives in CDN must know that place.I went a few times with my husband and he always happy because it's cheap.He once said to our waitress when he received the bill: 'That's it?' The food is not extravagant but tasty and the breakfast is only 2.00$. How you can beat that?
Overall great place.  I went there a lot with my friends at late night or afternoon. Their surlonge steak is great.  I like a lot. Except the portion is not enough for big guy, but the price is amazing. So it's a good place to order multiple foods at same to have a try.
Ahh! Blanche Neige, to be advised a fairy tale only measurably. The menu is inclusive and most connotative of a common diner. Its bill of fare covers from a conservative pasta dishes (i.e. spaghetti with meat sauce) to a similar in style, pizzas (i.e. deluxe and pepperoni). Blanche Neige does not in any ways embodies arrogant pretexts. I had the spaghetti special for 4.99$ that includes the soup of the day. The pastas were al dente and sufficient tomato sauce with a generous meat ratio. The soup was eloquently salted though. The restaurant is mainly populated with regular older folks. And sometime, a younger crowd on a budget.
Blanche Neiges is a hit or a miss. Avoid things that couldn't possibly be good in a diner... A $12 filet mignon, diner Chinese food, overly complicated salads are all things to avoid. Poutine snobs should be aware that the poutine is made with mozzarella, not curds!Their fries, chicken and veggie slouvaki, and sandwiches are done perfectly. They have ridiculously cheap specials like all inclusive early bird meals for 5.99 or a huge $2 breakfast. More importantly, they're open long after the bars close and they deliver beer as well as wine!A neighborhood gem'
Blanche neige is knowned for their 2$ breakfast! Yes 2$...2 eggs, choice of meat (sausage is the best), potatoes, toast and coffee! You can also get the large breakfast for 4$ and you get two extra pancakes. Breakfast is served daily from 6am-11am (Monday through Friday). Weekends are until 2pm! This place serves about everything..pizza, greek, chinese...anyways the pizza is not that bad but please avoid the chinese. The food is not bad but I wouldn't go and eat there unless I'm around the area or really hungry at night.I like the fact that they offer late night delivery until 2am. It is also opened 24h on the weekends so it could be a good place after a long night. Service is really a hit or miss! Not a bad place, they redecorated the place and It's not bad!
Where else can you sit in a fairly clean diner and eat a full breakfast for $1.99?
Just had the $2 breakfast, nothing wrong with that! basic, simple, but not too bad. Coffee is a bit weak, but doable, extra cup is .75. Left $4 and on my way. A bit slow service when they are full, only 2 wait staff, but just sit back and relax. Very much a diner feel.  I'll be back.
Its no secret that Im as cheap as it gets and any place that serves up a delicious hot breakfast for $2, is more than alright by me.Seriously, nothing gets me fired up quite like a sweat deal - and good luck trying to find a better deal than this.We're talking eggs, your choice of breakfast meats (i personally prefer the sausage), home fries, toast and coffee.  $2 bucks - straight up.  I mean - seriously...  $2 bucks!You cant even buy a back alley BJ for that price anymore.  And I promise you that if you can, it wont be nearly as satisfying as this breakfast..
Breakfast for 2$, eggs, bacon or sausage, fried potato wedges and toast + coffee or tea. I've been there a few times but won't go there after I've seen cockroaches crawling on the floor near the kitchen which by the way reeks  of cigarette smoke.I don't know what they're serving for 2 bucks or how they can afford it but I have a pretty bad feeling about the place.
If you're into budgeting, blanche neige is a well kept secret. While it doesn't hide any culinary delights, it is cheap and decent food. The dinners are massive, and if you get the special, highly affordable. It's alright stuff.But the restaurant shines with its brunch special. I'm not sure how they afford it, but you get ham or bacon, eggs, hash browns, toast and coffee or tea for TWO DOLLARS. It is sick - it isn't the best brunch in the world but for two dollars it outdoes itself in value. I was too lazy to get up early enough to get there on week days before class, but the brunch runs until eleven. On weekends brunch runs until 2 pm, and it must be a neighborhood secret because it is always packed. There will be a line.You definitely get what you pay for. Blanche Neige is the sketchy restaurant you pass by a few times. You might look at it and scoff. The inside comes unironically straight out of the seventies and you will have paper place mats. The service is alright in both french and english, but if you complain about brunch they'll tell you to suck it up or get out. But for two dollars, why complain? This place has character baby, and I definitely miss it.
My boyfriend was first introduced to Euro-Deli Batory by his good friend, who incidentally had lived in Poland for many years. We've since moved just down the street from this little secret of a place (not necessarily a factor in our decision), unassumingly nestled between the wood-smoke bagel shops of central Mile-End. The menu is pretty straightforward, tacked up on a long strip above the deli counters of fresh meats and cheeses. They serve classic Polish homestyle fare, including pierogies, stuffed cabbage rolls, Polish sausage, hunter's stew, borscht, and potato pancakes. They even serve fresh (and bottled to take home, if you want) tripe soup, as well as what I term "the man plate" - the "Polski Talarz", which is made up of a huge medley of everything. Inside, wooden walls give the impression of a small, warm cabin in the winter, ideal for the lengthy Montreal winters. A few tables are tucked to one side, and sitting beside them, a tiny grocery section filled with sweet treats. Service is friendly and quick. Prices are very reasonable and the food is always cooked hot and fresh. Really, what more can you ask for?
Shared the Polaski platter one early afternoon, it was delicious and we both left feeling stuffed! Definitely a winner if you want to sample more than one thing on the menu. Cozy and casual little place, looking forward to returning!
Have the borscht.The Hunter's Plate is great too but make sure you're planning a calorie burning activity afterwards, like stalking prey through the forest or going to the gym.
The moment you walk into this cozy little neighbourhood joint, the heady smell of delicious, savoury home-cooked food hits you. It's the kind of place that's easy to miss, so I'm glad my coworker introduced me to it.The menu is a nice selection of Polish comfort foods including several soups (Québec favourites French onion and pea soup alongside the more Polish beetroot and veggie soups), sausage, stuffed cabbage, and of course pierogies! The onion, mushroom, cheese and potato pierogies are a sure bet, and a plate of them comes with a little coleslaw, sour cream, and salad. Eat them in the cozy little dining area or take them to go. They also have various Polish products including some grocery items, DVDs, and other suchlike imported treats. Personally I like to grab one of the inexpensive Polish chocolate bars (75¢ - $1, just past the fancy expensive chocolate bars) to top off my comfort meal!
We went here on a hot summer day and started with a bowl of cold borscht. It was pink and had a dill flavor. It was excellent. The mixed pirogi plate was kind of a mixed bag- the sausage ones were ok. The mushroom ones were better and the cheese ones were the best. We shared some polish sausages and they were really good as well. The food is very well priced and there are about six tables in the market so grab a space if you can!
It's exactly as described - home-style Polish deli food. It brings back some ancient memories of mine from going to the houses of friends of my mom when I was a little kid in Edmonton. But the thing is... I don't think it's that great. Everything is a little too boiled and a little too bland and .. that's accurate, but I don't want to actually eat it. Sorry.
I have been going to this pierogi joint for years. Get a mixed pierogi plate with extra mushroom sauce and a side of sausage....The apple-cherry juice is dee-licious. Everything here is delicious! The soups, sandwiches, all of it. They sell their in house pierogis frozen as well, for snappy snacks at home.
Lovely polish fare in this cozy small dining roomVery much enjoyed the polish platter (see photo).Excellent value for stick-to-your-ribs foodrecommended. They also have a few polish groceries and food to take home.
Amazing heaping plates of crazy delicious perogies are to be had here, along with some of the best borscht (hot or cold) I've tasted. The spot is tiny, part specialty Polish grocer part restaurant (maybe 4 small tables total) all hot Polish lovin. The windows steam up in the winter and you can sit in companionable coziness eating your mounds of winterizing goodness, watching the cute families and couples mozey along St Viateur. Batory is located right next to the gorgeous church on St Viateur that hosts great craft fairs in the basement, making for an excellent one two punch of yum and yay.
This lil' deli is housed in a mini Polish emporium that sells groceries, movies, and magazines from the Motherland. The cornerstore vibe offers up quick and friendly service, and delicious, quality, authentic Polish food. Go for the potato-cheese perogies, Ukranian borscht, and side of sauerkraut and sausage. Nothing fancy here: just simple, classic Polish fare.  Once you've discovered this place, I guarantee you'll be planning your next lunch there! Did I mention that it's cheap too?! Easily my favorite diner in Mile End.
If I'm totally honest, and calculate this according to the following formula NUMBER OF VISITS x AMOUNT OF PLEASURE PER VISIT, Euro-Deli Batory is my favorite restaurant in the entire city. No other restaurant even comes close. I told someone behind the counter this one time and he blushed and ran back into the kitchen. Recommended: potato-cheese perogies, kielbasa, bigos, Ukrainian borscht, spring borscht (in the spring and summer).
Amazing cheap polish place. The perogies are to die for!Also, this place has polish desserts, groceries, movies and magazines...Basically if you're at all interested in Polish culture, check this little gem out!
