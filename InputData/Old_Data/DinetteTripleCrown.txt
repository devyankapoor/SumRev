Finally tried this place and I cannot wait to go back. It was the best southern food I ever had.The place a bit hard to find because the sign is small and the front of the restaurant does not scream restaurant but it is worth the trouble I swear. The second I walked in I wanted to try everything they had. I was not too sure how the menu worked but the waitress explained everything to us. She was amazingly friendly and super helpful.It was windy so didn't pick the picnic basket option so to walked one door down to sit in their new dinning room. They have fried chicken and pork and tonnes of amazing and tasty side. I had the chicken but I will be going soon to try the pork. The chicken was moist but I would of like it to have a little bit more flavor but turned out ok with the homestyle gravy and the different hot sauce on the table.For the sides we tried the hush puppies and they are to die for. The deep fried sweet potatoes are a must try, the mac & cheese was the best so warm and tasty the only thing I was not crazy about was greens it was a bit watery. They have a few fresh dessert of the day so never the same thing. That day they had an amazing blueberry pie with i cream and I had a chocolate pecan pie with bourbon whip cream and it was divine but extremely sweet.They also have so many drinks with or without alcohol and to be able to try everything you need to go many times so for sure I will be going back.For some comfort southern food, I made the trek to Dinette Triple Crown for a satisfying dinner. The place is an old school diner, with around 10 bar stools that look onto the quiet street outside. There's black and white images of horses, perhaps a homage to their name. On a chilly night, this was a warm haven. The menu had fried chicken, pulled pork, brisket, and lots of sides. Of course, I wanted everything. Sometimes though, what one wants and what the reality should be are quite different. So I settled on a 2 piece fried chicken plate, which gives me the options of 3 sides.After some anticipation, my plate arrived. The fried chicken was crispy on the outside, without being overly oily, and the meat, although a bit dry, had lots of flavour. Now, the sides. It came with possibly one of the best biscuits I've ever had. Flaky and buttery, and warm. The other sides- a choice of vinegar or creamy coleslaw (I chose the vinegar), and sweet potatoes. The coleslaw was light, and the sweet potatoes were oven roasted to perfection. As I savoured this delicious meal, I also got a sparkling lemonade to complement my meal. It wasn't overly sweet, and just a right amount of fizz. Surely, I had to end my meal with a southern dessert. A pecan sugar pie with fresh whipped cream? I was sold. The pie crust was flaky and crispy, and it was filled with pecans.There were lots of take out orders while I was there, and they also have a full dining room right next door. In the summer, this would make the perfect picnic to enjoy in the little pack across the street!So this place has gotten rave reviews on Yelp and I've heard about it here and there. I was excited to try it because being from the south I love to try any southern resto in my area. We walk in and see a tiny counter top, we are informed that we can walk outside and into the dining room. So we decide on that. The menu is a simple piece of paper with their limited options. They have smoked brisket, pulled pork, or fried chicken and a plethora of sides.This is what we ordered: brisket with hush puppies and Mac n cheese. 3 piece fried chicken with pinto beans and bacon, mashed potatoes and gravy, and cornbread.At first glance I can tell you a few things about the brisket. What I can tell you is that it isn't smoked and it doesn't taste good. Brisket when smoked should have a nice brown color with a dark outer bark. This looks like steamed flesh. Guess what? It's dry and very lack luster. I decide to add some of their homemade sauces to spice it up. Their vinegar based sauce is basically just vinegar and it wasn't good. The ketchup based was just that. Ketchup. The Mac and cheese was delicious, warm, and creamy for the first few bites. Once we got deeper into the mac and got to the sauce it got kind of disgusting. Have you ever eaten anything that you hate more and more with each bite? It left a sour after taste in my mouth. I've never had this happen before with food. The hush puppies were unremarkable at best. I didn't like or hate them.The fried chicken had a nice spice coat. The skin was very good because that is where all the flavor lived. Once we got past the skin the chicken was dry. Thank God for the gravy because that was amazing! The pinto beans were good, the mashed potatoes were amazing (again, that gravy!), and the corn bread was bad, like really bad. One side was cooked well and the bottom side was practically raw. What impressed me? I loved their sparkling homemade lemonade. I liked how knowledgable their wait staff was on the menu and the sauces. I also really loved their "Derby Pie" which is made with chocolate chips, bourbon, and walnuts. It was so sweet I hated myself for eating it. What didn't impress me: in general their food. The fact that after eating I had to walk out of the dining room, outside to the street, and come back in the "counter top" part to pay.I might try again in the summer with their picnic baskets but right now I'm still wondering how they have 119 positive reviews when I was less than not even impressed.We had the brilliant idea to order a bunch of food and then devour in the nearby park. It was as fun as it sounds!So we came here on a Saturday night, grabbed our prepared basket and crossed the street. Seems like other people had the same idea but we had a nice bench to share the southern feast. We ordered a little bit of everything and the things that stood out for me what of course, the excellent chicken, the lemonade and the dessert. Everything else was solid but I'd come back just for the chicken. On a special note, I didn't like the Mac n' Cheese, it felt off.Price-tag is pretty expensive. Service was fine. Picnic idea is pretty awesome. :)Just an update because my old review had out of date info - Dinette has now extended into the room next door which gives them a bunch more tables, and they've got there liquor license and are serving up incredibly delicious cocktails. You can and should order a picnic to go and if you do this, don't be ridiculous, please call in your order in advance. Then you can walk up like a rocker to hear them calling your name and serving up your picnic right on time and you will be the hero of dinner, which is a brief and fleeting glory but an easily attainable bit of awesome for you and your pals.First off, be careful as the main restaurant isn't clearly marked.  There's a sign and an entrance into the take-out part of the restaurant that has a few counter seats, but if you go outside and enter in the door at the corner, that's where the main dining room is.  Anyway, the BBQ is really great.  I had the Brisket and it was cooked to perfection.  Yum.  Highly recommend.I love that this place does picnic baskets that you can take out to the park and eat then return the basket later - very creative, cute, and unique... Especially given the lovely parks that montreal has during summer. This time we ate at the actual restaurant which was nice and rustic feeling. I found that the food was good, very clean, very good quality seeming ingredients, the fried chicken was tasty and not greasy at all- I didn't feel the way I do after eating KFC (even though I like the taste of KFC more flavour-wise) but this chicken was something that you could imagine being served in a country BnB.. I did find that the food was a bit dry, however we went in a huge group (20 people) and I would bet that it was likely only slightly dry because of the wait/prep time for handing the huge group. I would definitely be down for trying out one of their adorable picnic basket lunches to take to a park one day.3.5 stars for me on this. Had the opportunity of sampling some of their Crispy fried chicken at an Elite event along with collard greens and hush puppies. The fried chicken was moist n crispy but as far as flavour goes it was nothing wow amazing! Collard greens were good not too salty nor over powered with butter. Hush puppies were okay just like fried cornbread.  What really topped the cake for me was the sauce offering on the table that ranged from a mustard to a spicy one to a vinegar based not that helped awaken the flavours of the chicken. You can slather as much of that stuff on till your Heart is content. The inside of the restaurant is somewhat small so they came up with the Ingenious idea to offer a picnic basket so you can take your souther food into the park. Very  clever to offer this up to give a great experience. Decor is old fashioned music is that old southern music to help support the dining experience. I thought the food was good but not knock your socks off wow! I will come back after another visit to update the review from testing other items.If you're looking for authentic southern comfort food you won't be disappointed. Everything i got was delicious from the buttery biscuits, crispy chicken to the creamy mac and cheese. I suggest ordering the food to go that way you can eat at the nearby park. They will pack everything in a lovely picnic basket complete with plates, napkins etc... What a neat concept!I can't wait to go back to try some of their other sides such as the hushpuppies and mashed potatoes with gravy. I just have to warn you of the wait though, I waited about 45 minutes to get my order but it didn't matter anymore as soon as I started eating!The service was awesome! The spicy drink was awesome! The food was awesome! I really enjoyed the bottles of sauces on the table, homemade and delicious. The set up of the eating areas were cool. The blues music playing in the background was on point. The price is what you expect from Montreal. Great experience and I will return.This is the one place i cant wait to come back to every time im in Montreal. Its comfort food at its finest kind of like your grandma giving u a big warm hug but even better.Favourites:Fried chickenMac and cheeseHush puppiesBrisket(with their home made bbq sauce)Biscuit and gravyArnold palmer(drink)Holy fried chicken Batman!  I'll be dreaming about my meal at Dinette Triple Crown for a long time it was so good.  They are a small restaurant serving up what has to be the best Southern food in Montreal.   They also make picnic baskets in summertime so you can take the food to the park across the street for a picnic.The ambiance here is great.  It's casual, laidback and has a Southern feel to it.   They've also got old school music playing which also is a fun touch.  I'm fairly certain that the music is mostly from the 20s but I could be mistaken on that one.The fried chicken oh the fried chicken!  Normally I'm not the biggest fan of it but this one was awesome!  It was crispy and I loved the seasoning.  The sides are not to be missed either.  The mac and cheese was creamy and divine.  The biscuit was flaky and buttery.  I was so full but couldn't bring myself to stop eating because I couldn't let that food go to waste.Somehow after all that food I managed to find room for a slice of chess pie.  It's a cornmeal and buttermilk pie seasoned with lemon zest.  It was dense and well balanced.  The crust was flaky and buttery.  Even the whipped cream wasn't your average whipped cream from a can.  Desserts change daily so be sure to ask what they have when you go.They serve up the classic cocktails you can get anywhere as well as a few of their own creations.  Go for the ones that they've developed because those are delicious.  They are also strong and worth the money.  I had what I believe was called the Briar's Patch and I really enjoyed it.  It had bourbon, soda, lemon and something else which I can't remember but you could really taste the alcohol.  They also spike the milkshakes with bourbon if you're in the mood for that.I've made it a mission to come back and try everything on the menu because there is just so much more to discover.  Dinette Triple Crown is seriously amazing.  You get a delicious meal for fairly reasonable prices.  What's not to love about that?Their "picnic basket in the park" option is one of my favorite dining experiences in the city. Everything on their menu is delicious (don't skip dessert) and on par or better than Southern food I've had anywhere else, including the South. They get really busy at times (weekends), so it's best to call about an hour in advance. A must for anyone visiting Montreal during the summer.Dinette Triple Crown, a Southern restaurant run by a Kentucky chef, serves a hell of a mac n' cheese! Topped with delicious homemade lemonade and chili-blackberry soda, the whole thing handed to us in a cute picnic basket for casual eating in the nearby park, the experience was memorable.The place is small but charming, and allows visitors to see the staff working in the kitchen. The service was perfect and amicable, and the menu is tempting. As a vegetarian, I will admit I cannot speak for the quality of their fried chicken, the but mac n' cheese is something; fresh, chewy, cheesy. Adding to the hundred-plus existing reviews, I confirm that this place is worth visiting. My Texan husband, who sometimes misses the food from home, loves this place.My experience here for some reason wasn't as good as i expected. The reviews looked great and even my boyfriend recommended Dinette Triple Crown. I did find their food delicious but the entire combo might have been too salty for my taste. The Macaroni tasted perfect but I would recommend not taking it with Hushpuppies. The fried chicken itself was mice but I wish they were crispier. I had better fried chicken in Montreal (re: Prohibition at NDG). I was not satisified with staff service as well, for some reason but maybe they were just having a bad day. Perhaps, I'll have to revisit again to sew if my experience is any different.I love the picnic concept and i think it was adorable! The Mcnasty: fried chicken served on a biscuit covered in their gravy. I had a bite and it was good, I enjoyed it. Mac and cheese was too watery, lacking seasoning and the cheeses they used were not the best combination. lemonade was alright, nothing worth going crazy for. mash potato was flavourless and the consistency of it was off. Not clumpy enough and not smooth enough, the gravy served with it was also bland, needs a lot more seasoning. The hush puppies came in 6, but that was 6 balls of meh. It was not good. It didnt taste like much, it was dry and needs a lot more filling because it was all bread. overall inconsistent and would not return.There are a few vegetarian option here, and they are delicious. The Mac and cheese wasn't the creamy kind Im used to but rather surprisingly and deliciously soupy; best to eat it with a spoon. The cornbread was browned on one side, which made it slightly crispy. The sweet potatoes were soft with a crunchy skin. The coke slaw was vinegary and added a nice tangy touch. Highly recommended as a place for both vegetarian and meat lovers.The server told us that the chef is south American and that makes the whole place more authentic. Everything I had was enjoyed and comforting. There are about several different bottles of homemade sauces on the side of the table which are absolutely fantastic and goes well with pretty much anything on the menu.I highly recommend this place not only for Southern American food but just for the sake of eating good comfort food.Amazing place amazing service amazing food. Definitely coming back to this hidden gem.Sweet potatos so far the best in my life. The pumpkin cake really reminded me of my school years.

They have smoked brisket, pulled pork, or fried chicken and a plethora of sides.This is what we ordered: brisket with hush puppies and Mac n cheese. 3 piece fried chicken with pinto beans and bacon, mashed potatoes and gravy, and cornbread.At first glance I can tell you a few things about the brisket. What I can tell you is that it isn't smoked and it doesn't taste good. Brisket when smoked should have a nice brown color with a dark outer bark. This looks like steamed flesh. Guess what? It's dry and very lack luster. I decide to add some of their homemade sauces to spice it up. Their vinegar based sauce is basically just vinegar and it wasn't good. The ketchup based was just that. Ketchup. The Mac and cheese was delicious, warm, and creamy for the first few bites. Once we got deeper into the mac and got to the sauce it got kind of disgusting. Have you ever eaten anything that you hate more and more with each bite? It left a sour after taste in my mouth. I've never had this happen before with food. The hush puppies were unremarkable at best. I didn't like or hate them.The fried chicken had a nice spice coat. The skin was very good because that is where all the flavor lived. Once we got past the skin the chicken was dry. Thank God for the gravy because that was amazing! The pinto beans were good, the mashed potatoes were amazing (again, that gravy!), and the corn bread was bad, like really bad. One side was cooked well and the bottom side was practically raw. What impressed me? I loved their sparkling homemade lemonade. I liked how knowledgable their wait staff was on the menu and the sauces. I also really loved their "Derby Pie" which is made with chocolate chips, bourbon, and walnuts. It was so sweet I hated myself for eating it. What didn't impress me: in general their food. The fact that after eating I had to walk out of the dining room, outside to the street, and come back in the "counter top" part to pay.I might try again in the summer with their picnic baskets but right now I'm still wondering how they have 119 positive reviews when I was less than not even impressed.We had the brilliant idea to order a bunch of food and then devour in the nearby park. It was as fun as it sounds!So we came here on a Saturday night, grabbed our prepared basket and crossed the street. Seems like other people had the same idea but we had a nice bench to share the southern feast. We ordered a little bit of everything and the things that stood out for me what of course, the excellent chicken, the lemonade and the dessert. Everything else was solid but I'd come back just for the chicken. On a special note, I didn't like the Mac n' Cheese, it felt off.Price-tag is pretty expensive. Service was fine. Picnic idea is pretty awesome. :)Just an update because my old review had out of date info - Dinette has now extended into the room next door which gives them a bunch more tables, and they've got there liquor license and are serving up incredibly delicious cocktails. You can and should order a picnic to go and if you do this, don't be ridiculous, please call in your order in advance. Then you can walk up like a rocker to hear them calling your name and serving up your picnic right on time and you will be the hero of dinner, which is a brief and fleeting glory but an easily attainable bit of awesome for you and your pals.First off, be careful as the main restaurant isn't clearly marked.  There's a sign and an entrance into the take-out part of the restaurant that has a few counter seats, but if you go outside and enter in the door at the corner, that's where the main dining room is.  Anyway, the BBQ is really great.  I had the Brisket and it was cooked to perfection.  Yum.  Highly recommend.I love that this place does picnic baskets that you can take out to the park and eat then return the basket later - very creative, cute, and unique... Especially given the lovely parks that montreal has during summer. This time we ate at the actual restaurant which was nice and rustic feeling. I found that the food was good, very clean, very good quality seeming ingredients, the fried chicken was tasty and not greasy at all- I didn't feel the way I do after eating KFC (even though I like the taste of KFC more flavour-wise) but this chicken was something that you could imagine being served in a country BnB.. I did find that the food was a bit dry, however we went in a huge group (20 people) and I would bet that it was likely only slightly dry because of the wait/prep time for handing the huge group. I would definitely be down for trying out one of their adorable picnic basket lunches to take to a park one day.3.5 stars for me on this. Had the opportunity of sampling some of their Crispy fried chicken at an Elite event along with collard greens and hush puppies. The fried chicken was moist n crispy but as far as flavour goes it was nothing wow amazing! Collard greens were good not too salty nor over powered with butter. Hush puppies were okay just like fried cornbread.  What really topped the cake for me was the sauce offering on the table that ranged from a mustard to a spicy one to a vinegar based not that helped awaken the flavours of the chicken. You can slather as much of that stuff on till your Heart is content. The inside of the restaurant is somewhat small so they came up with the Ingenious idea to offer a picnic basket so you can take your souther food into the park. Very  clever to offer this up to give a great experience. Decor is old fashioned music is that old southern music to help support the dining experience. I thought the food was good but not knock your socks off wow! I will come back after another visit to update the review from testing other items.If you're looking for authentic southern comfort food you won't be disappointed. Everything i got was delicious from the buttery biscuits, crispy chicken to the creamy mac and cheese. I suggest ordering the food to go that way you can eat at the nearby park. They will pack everything in a lovely picnic basket complete with plates, napkins etc... What a neat concept!I can't wait to go back to try some of their other sides such as the hushpuppies and mashed potatoes with gravy. I just have to warn you of the wait though, I waited about 45 minutes to get my order but it didn't matter anymore as soon as I started eating!The service was awesome! The spicy drink was awesome! The food was awesome! I really enjoyed the bottles of sauces on the table, homemade and delicious. The set up of the eating areas were cool. The blues music playing in the background was on point. The price is what you expect from Montreal. Great experience and I will return.This is the one place i cant wait to come back to every time im in Montreal. Its comfort food at its finest kind of like your grandma giving u a big warm hug but even better.Favourites:Fried chickenMac and cheeseHush puppiesBrisket(with their home made bbq sauce)Biscuit and gravyArnold palmer(drink)Holy fried chicken Batman!  I'll be dreaming about my meal at Dinette Triple Crown for a long time it was so good.  They are a small restaurant serving up what has to be the best Southern food in Montreal.   They also make picnic baskets in summertime so you can take the food to the park across the street for a picnic.The ambiance here is great.  It's casual, laidback and has a Southern feel to it.   They've also got old school music playing which also is a fun touch.  I'm fairly certain that the music is mostly from the 20s but I could be mistaken on that one.The fried chicken oh the fried chicken!  Normally I'm not the biggest fan of it but this one was awesome!  It was crispy and I loved the seasoning.  The sides are not to be missed either.  The mac and cheese was creamy and divine.  The biscuit was flaky and buttery.  I was so full but couldn't bring myself to stop eating because I couldn't let that food go to waste.Somehow after all that food I managed to find room for a slice of chess pie.  It's a cornmeal and buttermilk pie seasoned with lemon zest.  It was dense and well balanced.  The crust was flaky and buttery.  Even the whipped cream wasn't your average whipped cream from a can.  Desserts change daily so be sure to ask what they have when you go.They serve up the classic cocktails you can get anywhere as well as a few of their own creations.  Go for the ones that they've developed because those are delicious.  They are also strong and worth the money.  I had what I believe was called the Briar's Patch and I really enjoyed it.  It had bourbon, soda, lemon and something else which I can't remember but you could really taste the alcohol.  They also spike the milkshakes with bourbon if you're in the mood for that.I've made it a mission to come back and try everything on the menu because there is just so much more to discover.  Dinette Triple Crown is seriously amazing.  You get a delicious meal for fairly reasonable prices.  What's not to love about that?Their "picnic basket in the park" option is one of my favorite dining experiences in the city. Everything on their menu is delicious (don't skip dessert) and on par or better than Southern food I've had anywhere else, including the South. They get really busy at times (weekends), so it's best to call about an hour in advance. A must for anyone visiting Montreal during the summer.Dinette Triple Crown, a Southern restaurant run by a Kentucky chef, serves a hell of a mac n' cheese! Topped with delicious homemade lemonade and chili-blackberry soda, the whole thing handed to us in a cute picnic basket for casual eating in the nearby park, the experience was memorable.The place is small but charming, and allows visitors to see the staff working in the kitchen. The service was perfect and amicable, and the menu is tempting. As a vegetarian, I will admit I cannot speak for the quality of their fried chicken, the but mac n' cheese is something; fresh, chewy, cheesy. Adding to the hundred-plus existing reviews, I confirm that this place is worth visiting. My Texan husband, who sometimes misses the food from home, loves this place.My experience here for some reason wasn't as good as i expected. The reviews looked great and even my boyfriend recommended Dinette Triple Crown. I did find their food delicious but the entire combo might have been too salty for my taste. The Macaroni tasted perfect but I would recommend not taking it with Hushpuppies. The fried chicken itself was mice but I wish they were crispier. I had better fried chicken in Montreal (re: Prohibition at NDG). I was not satisified with staff service as well, for some reason but maybe they were just having a bad day. Perhaps, I'll have to revisit again to sew if my experience is any different.I love the picnic concept and i think it was adorable! The Mcnasty: fried chicken served on a biscuit covered in their gravy. I had a bite and it was good, I enjoyed it. Mac and cheese was too watery, lacking seasoning and the cheeses they used were not the best combination. lemonade was alright, nothing worth going crazy for. mash potato was flavourless and the consistency of it was off. Not clumpy enough and not smooth enough, the gravy served with it was also bland, needs a lot more seasoning. The hush puppies came in 6, but that was 6 balls of meh. It was not good. It didnt taste like much, it was dry and needs a lot more filling because it was all bread. overall inconsistent and would not return.There are a few vegetarian option here, and they are delicious. The Mac and cheese wasn't the creamy kind Im used to but rather surprisingly and deliciously soupy; best to eat it with a spoon. The cornbread was browned on one side, which made it slightly crispy. The sweet potatoes were soft with a crunchy skin. The coke slaw was vinegary and added a nice tangy touch. Highly recommended as a place for both vegetarian and meat lovers.The server told us that the chef is south American and that makes the whole place more authentic. Everything I had was enjoyed and comforting. There are about several different bottles of homemade sauces on the side of the table which are absolutely fantastic and goes well with pretty much anything on the menu.I highly recommend this place not only for Southern American food but just for the sake of eating good comfort food.Amazing place amazing service amazing food. Definitely coming back to this hidden gem.Sweet potatos so far the best in my life. The pumpkin cake really reminded me of my school years. Love it!Finally tried this place and I cannot wait to go back. It was the best southern food I ever had.The place a bit hard to find because the sign is small and the front of the restaurant does not scream restaurant but it is worth the trouble I swear. The second I walked in I wanted to try everything they had. I was not too sure how the menu worked but the waitress explained everything to us. She was amazingly friendly and super helpful.It was windy so didn't pick the picnic basket option so to walked one door down to sit in their new dinning room. They have fried chicken and pork and tonnes of amazing and tasty side. I had the chicken but I will be going soon to try the pork. The chicken was moist but I would of like it to have a little bit more flavor but turned out ok with the homestyle gravy and the different hot sauce on the table.For the sides we tried the hush puppies and they are to die for. The deep fried sweet potatoes are a must try, the mac & cheese was the best so warm and tasty the only thing I was not crazy about was greens it was a bit watery. They have a few fresh dessert of the day so never the same thing. That day they had an amazing blueberry pie with i cream and I had a chocolate pecan pie with bourbon whip cream and it was divine but extremely sweet.They also have so many drinks with or without alcohol and to be able to try everything you need to go many times so for sure I will be going back.For some comfort southern food, I made the trek to Dinette Triple Crown for a satisfying dinner. The place is an old school diner, with around 10 bar stools that look onto the quiet street outside. There's black and white images of horses, perhaps a homage to their name. On a chilly night, this was a warm haven. The menu had fried chicken, pulled pork, brisket, and lots of sides. Of course, I wanted everything. Sometimes though, what one wants and what the reality should be are quite different. So I settled on a 2 piece fried chicken plate, which gives me the options of 3 sides.After some anticipation, my plate arrived. The fried chicken was crispy on the outside, without being overly oily, and the meat, although a bit dry, had lots of flavour. Now, the sides. It came with possibly one of the best biscuits I've ever had. Flaky and buttery, and warm. The other sides- a choice of vinegar or creamy coleslaw (I chose the vinegar), and sweet potatoes. The coleslaw was light, and the sweet potatoes were oven roasted to perfection. As I savoured this delicious meal, I also got a sparkling lemonade to complement my meal. It wasn't overly sweet, and just a right amount of fizz. Surely, I had to end my meal with a southern dessert. A pecan sugar pie with fresh whipped cream? I was sold. The pie crust was flaky and crispy, and it was filled with pecans.There were lots of take out orders while I was there, and they also have a full dining room right next door. In the summer, this would make the perfect picnic to enjoy in the little pack across the street!So this place has gotten rave reviews on Yelp and I've heard about it here and there.

Then you can walk up like a rocker to hear them calling your name and serving up your picnic right on time and you will be the hero of dinner, which is a brief and fleeting glory but an easily attainable bit of awesome for you and your pals.First off, be careful as the main restaurant isn't clearly marked.  There's a sign and an entrance into the take-out part of the restaurant that has a few counter seats, but if you go outside and enter in the door at the corner, that's where the main dining room is.  Anyway, the BBQ is really great.  I had the Brisket and it was cooked to perfection.  Yum.  Highly recommend.I love that this place does picnic baskets that you can take out to the park and eat then return the basket later - very creative, cute, and unique... Especially given the lovely parks that montreal has during summer. This time we ate at the actual restaurant which was nice and rustic feeling. I found that the food was good, very clean, very good quality seeming ingredients, the fried chicken was tasty and not greasy at all- I didn't feel the way I do after eating KFC (even though I like the taste of KFC more flavour-wise) but this chicken was something that you could imagine being served in a country BnB.. I did find that the food was a bit dry, however we went in a huge group (20 people) and I would bet that it was likely only slightly dry because of the wait/prep time for handing the huge group. I would definitely be down for trying out one of their adorable picnic basket lunches to take to a park one day.3.5 stars for me on this. Had the opportunity of sampling some of their Crispy fried chicken at an Elite event along with collard greens and hush puppies. The fried chicken was moist n crispy but as far as flavour goes it was nothing wow amazing! Collard greens were good not too salty nor over powered with butter. Hush puppies were okay just like fried cornbread.  What really topped the cake for me was the sauce offering on the table that ranged from a mustard to a spicy one to a vinegar based not that helped awaken the flavours of the chicken. You can slather as much of that stuff on till your Heart is content. The inside of the restaurant is somewhat small so they came up with the Ingenious idea to offer a picnic basket so you can take your souther food into the park. Very  clever to offer this up to give a great experience. Decor is old fashioned music is that old southern music to help support the dining experience. I thought the food was good but not knock your socks off wow! I will come back after another visit to update the review from testing other items.If you're looking for authentic southern comfort food you won't be disappointed. Everything i got was delicious from the buttery biscuits, crispy chicken to the creamy mac and cheese. I suggest ordering the food to go that way you can eat at the nearby park. They will pack everything in a lovely picnic basket complete with plates, napkins etc... What a neat concept!I can't wait to go back to try some of their other sides such as the hushpuppies and mashed potatoes with gravy. I just have to warn you of the wait though, I waited about 45 minutes to get my order but it didn't matter anymore as soon as I started eating!The service was awesome! The spicy drink was awesome! The food was awesome! I really enjoyed the bottles of sauces on the table, homemade and delicious. The set up of the eating areas were cool. The blues music playing in the background was on point. The price is what you expect from Montreal. Great experience and I will return.This is the one place i cant wait to come back to every time im in Montreal. Its comfort food at its finest kind of like your grandma giving u a big warm hug but even better.Favourites:Fried chickenMac and cheeseHush puppiesBrisket(with their home made bbq sauce)Biscuit and gravyArnold palmer(drink)Holy fried chicken Batman!  I'll be dreaming about my meal at Dinette Triple Crown for a long time it was so good.  They are a small restaurant serving up what has to be the best Southern food in Montreal.   They also make picnic baskets in summertime so you can take the food to the park across the street for a picnic.The ambiance here is great.  It's casual, laidback and has a Southern feel to it.   They've also got old school music playing which also is a fun touch.  I'm fairly certain that the music is mostly from the 20s but I could be mistaken on that one.The fried chicken oh the fried chicken!  Normally I'm not the biggest fan of it but this one was awesome!  It was crispy and I loved the seasoning.  The sides are not to be missed either.  The mac and cheese was creamy and divine.  The biscuit was flaky and buttery.  I was so full but couldn't bring myself to stop eating because I couldn't let that food go to waste.Somehow after all that food I managed to find room for a slice of chess pie.  It's a cornmeal and buttermilk pie seasoned with lemon zest.  It was dense and well balanced.  The crust was flaky and buttery.  Even the whipped cream wasn't your average whipped cream from a can.  Desserts change daily so be sure to ask what they have when you go.They serve up the classic cocktails you can get anywhere as well as a few of their own creations.  Go for the ones that they've developed because those are delicious.  They are also strong and worth the money.  I had what I believe was called the Briar's Patch and I really enjoyed it.  It had bourbon, soda, lemon and something else which I can't remember but you could really taste the alcohol.  They also spike the milkshakes with bourbon if you're in the mood for that.I've made it a mission to come back and try everything on the menu because there is just so much more to discover.  Dinette Triple Crown is seriously amazing.  You get a delicious meal for fairly reasonable prices.  What's not to love about that?Their "picnic basket in the park" option is one of my favorite dining experiences in the city. Everything on their menu is delicious (don't skip dessert) and on par or better than Southern food I've had anywhere else, including the South. They get really busy at times (weekends), so it's best to call about an hour in advance. A must for anyone visiting Montreal during the summer.Dinette Triple Crown, a Southern restaurant run by a Kentucky chef, serves a hell of a mac n' cheese! Topped with delicious homemade lemonade and chili-blackberry soda, the whole thing handed to us in a cute picnic basket for casual eating in the nearby park, the experience was memorable.The place is small but charming, and allows visitors to see the staff working in the kitchen. The service was perfect and amicable, and the menu is tempting. As a vegetarian, I will admit I cannot speak for the quality of their fried chicken, the but mac n' cheese is something; fresh, chewy, cheesy. Adding to the hundred-plus existing reviews, I confirm that this place is worth visiting. My Texan husband, who sometimes misses the food from home, loves this place.My experience here for some reason wasn't as good as i expected. The reviews looked great and even my boyfriend recommended Dinette Triple Crown. I did find their food delicious but the entire combo might have been too salty for my taste. The Macaroni tasted perfect but I would recommend not taking it with Hushpuppies. The fried chicken itself was mice but I wish they were crispier. I had better fried chicken in Montreal (re: Prohibition at NDG). I was not satisified with staff service as well, for some reason but maybe they were just having a bad day. Perhaps, I'll have to revisit again to sew if my experience is any different.I love the picnic concept and i think it was adorable! The Mcnasty: fried chicken served on a biscuit covered in their gravy. I had a bite and it was good, I enjoyed it. Mac and cheese was too watery, lacking seasoning and the cheeses they used were not the best combination. lemonade was alright, nothing worth going crazy for. mash potato was flavourless and the consistency of it was off. Not clumpy enough and not smooth enough, the gravy served with it was also bland, needs a lot more seasoning. The hush puppies came in 6, but that was 6 balls of meh. It was not good. It didnt taste like much, it was dry and needs a lot more filling because it was all bread. overall inconsistent and would not return.There are a few vegetarian option here, and they are delicious. The Mac and cheese wasn't the creamy kind Im used to but rather surprisingly and deliciously soupy; best to eat it with a spoon. The cornbread was browned on one side, which made it slightly crispy. The sweet potatoes were soft with a crunchy skin. The coke slaw was vinegary and added a nice tangy touch. Highly recommended as a place for both vegetarian and meat lovers.The server told us that the chef is south American and that makes the whole place more authentic. Everything I had was enjoyed and comforting. There are about several different bottles of homemade sauces on the side of the table which are absolutely fantastic and goes well with pretty much anything on the menu.I highly recommend this place not only for Southern American food but just for the sake of eating good comfort food.Amazing place amazing service amazing food. Definitely coming back to this hidden gem.Sweet potatos so far the best in my life. The pumpkin cake really reminded me of my school years. Love it!Finally tried this place and I cannot wait to go back. It was the best southern food I ever had.The place a bit hard to find because the sign is small and the front of the restaurant does not scream restaurant but it is worth the trouble I swear. The second I walked in I wanted to try everything they had. I was not too sure how the menu worked but the waitress explained everything to us. She was amazingly friendly and super helpful.It was windy so didn't pick the picnic basket option so to walked one door down to sit in their new dinning room. They have fried chicken and pork and tonnes of amazing and tasty side. I had the chicken but I will be going soon to try the pork. The chicken was moist but I would of like it to have a little bit more flavor but turned out ok with the homestyle gravy and the different hot sauce on the table.For the sides we tried the hush puppies and they are to die for. The deep fried sweet potatoes are a must try, the mac & cheese was the best so warm and tasty the only thing I was not crazy about was greens it was a bit watery. They have a few fresh dessert of the day so never the same thing. That day they had an amazing blueberry pie with i cream and I had a chocolate pecan pie with bourbon whip cream and it was divine but extremely sweet.They also have so many drinks with or without alcohol and to be able to try everything you need to go many times so for sure I will be going back.For some comfort southern food, I made the trek to Dinette Triple Crown for a satisfying dinner. The place is an old school diner, with around 10 bar stools that look onto the quiet street outside. There's black and white images of horses, perhaps a homage to their name. On a chilly night, this was a warm haven. The menu had fried chicken, pulled pork, brisket, and lots of sides. Of course, I wanted everything. Sometimes though, what one wants and what the reality should be are quite different. So I settled on a 2 piece fried chicken plate, which gives me the options of 3 sides.After some anticipation, my plate arrived. The fried chicken was crispy on the outside, without being overly oily, and the meat, although a bit dry, had lots of flavour. Now, the sides. It came with possibly one of the best biscuits I've ever had. Flaky and buttery, and warm. The other sides- a choice of vinegar or creamy coleslaw (I chose the vinegar), and sweet potatoes. The coleslaw was light, and the sweet potatoes were oven roasted to perfection. As I savoured this delicious meal, I also got a sparkling lemonade to complement my meal. It wasn't overly sweet, and just a right amount of fizz. Surely, I had to end my meal with a southern dessert. A pecan sugar pie with fresh whipped cream? I was sold. The pie crust was flaky and crispy, and it was filled with pecans.There were lots of take out orders while I was there, and they also have a full dining room right next door. In the summer, this would make the perfect picnic to enjoy in the little pack across the street!So this place has gotten rave reviews on Yelp and I've heard about it here and there. I was excited to try it because being from the south I love to try any southern resto in my area. We walk in and see a tiny counter top, we are informed that we can walk outside and into the dining room. So we decide on that. The menu is a simple piece of paper with their limited options. They have smoked brisket, pulled pork, or fried chicken and a plethora of sides.This is what we ordered: brisket with hush puppies and Mac n cheese. 3 piece fried chicken with pinto beans and bacon, mashed potatoes and gravy, and cornbread.At first glance I can tell you a few things about the brisket. What I can tell you is that it isn't smoked and it doesn't taste good. Brisket when smoked should have a nice brown color with a dark outer bark. This looks like steamed flesh. Guess what? It's dry and very lack luster. I decide to add some of their homemade sauces to spice it up. Their vinegar based sauce is basically just vinegar and it wasn't good. The ketchup based was just that. Ketchup. The Mac and cheese was delicious, warm, and creamy for the first few bites. Once we got deeper into the mac and got to the sauce it got kind of disgusting. Have you ever eaten anything that you hate more and more with each bite? It left a sour after taste in my mouth. I've never had this happen before with food. The hush puppies were unremarkable at best. I didn't like or hate them.The fried chicken had a nice spice coat. The skin was very good because that is where all the flavor lived. Once we got past the skin the chicken was dry. Thank God for the gravy because that was amazing! The pinto beans were good, the mashed potatoes were amazing (again, that gravy!), and the corn bread was bad, like really bad. One side was cooked well and the bottom side was practically raw. What impressed me? I loved their sparkling homemade lemonade. I liked how knowledgable their wait staff was on the menu and the sauces. I also really loved their "Derby Pie" which is made with chocolate chips, bourbon, and walnuts. It was so sweet I hated myself for eating it. What didn't impress me: in general their food. The fact that after eating I had to walk out of the dining room, outside to the street, and come back in the "counter top" part to pay.I might try again in the summer with their picnic baskets but right now I'm still wondering how they have 119 positive reviews when I was less than not even impressed.We had the brilliant idea to order a bunch of food and then devour in the nearby park. It was as fun as it sounds!So we came here on a Saturday night, grabbed our prepared basket and crossed the street. Seems like other people had the same idea but we had a nice bench to share the southern feast. We ordered a little bit of everything and the things that stood out for me what of course, the excellent chicken, the lemonade and the dessert. Everything else was solid but I'd come back just for the chicken. On a special note, I didn't like the Mac n' Cheese, it felt off.Price-tag is pretty expensive. Service was fine.
