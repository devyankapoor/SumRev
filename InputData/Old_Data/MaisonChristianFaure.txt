They had a variety of macaroon flavors, and lots of delicious viennoiseries and confiseries ! It is a great place to stop for desserts and tea or to catch up with friends or even on a date since it's not to loud inside. And best believe it, the macaroons are amazing and has since raised the bar. It's a interesting mix of cafe and pastry school and shop all in oneBad : The prices are a bit steep, but what can you expect from a renown pastry chef? Bottom Line: I will definitely be returning to this lovely spot if I am in the mood to spoil myself.This is definitely a destination you must visit in Montreal, we tried a little bit of everything and it was all amazing! My favorite was the macarons (in TONS of awesome colors and flavors), and the Chocolate Almond Croissant. We also took a bag of homemade marshmallows to go, which were very very good. The maple ones we got were a tad too sweet for my taste, so i'd probably just get the vanilla if i got more. Cant wait to be back in montreal so we can go here again!Cute place for brunch or a treat from the bakery -- You get into line and as you get closer to the cashier, you'll be asked if you're eating in. If take out, you stay in line. If eating in, the server will clear a table for you and bring you menus with the sandwich/salad options (not sure if you can order those items for take out, or only the pastries/bakery items). Our food:Brunch on the Plank: orange juice, croissant, eggs benedict on a choux pastry with smoked salmon, brioche "nanterre" with caramel sauce, mini fruit cup. The OJ was wonderful, definitely freshly squeezed. I didn't try the eggs benedict since the portion was so small - he said it was good, though the hollandaise sauce was different than the norm. The caramel sauce for the brioche was delicious and decadent. Fruit cup was mostly pineapple and melon.Crab/lobster salad on a choux pastry: amazing presentation and decent chunks of lobster meat evident, but the choux pastry itself didn't taste fresh. The croissant from the brunch on the plank was delicious enough that we ordered another - note that they are more soft/flaky than crispy.Lemonade: too tart for meTotal was $42 with taxes, before tip.I'm not sure if it is because I came here an hour before they close, or their service is just terrible all the time. The guy did not bother explaining any of their desserts (even after I asked what each one was), as they seem to be more concerned with closing the place on time than selling the rest of their desserts. We chose one of the pistachio cakes and a mango gelato from the fridge. I have no idea what was in the pistachio cake since the guy didn't bother to tell me at all... if that wasn't bad enough, they didn't have any plastic knifes or folks. It took asking 3 different staff members and 5 good minutes of waiting around for them to get a couple of folks. ** oh and there are seating areas but apparently they won't let you sit there an hour before they close since they close that area first. As for the actual desserts, they were alright. The cake was mediocre at best and the gelato was way too sweet. Maybe I didn't try the right desserts, but will not be returning.Food 5/5 decor 3/5 staff&service 3/5Great decor, had the chocolate croissant and the chocolatine, they were soooo good and fresh. Definetly intend on going there for brunch!!It says the coffee is ILLY. I feel It's not as good as these in ILLY store. For desserts, I like the pot caramel fleur de sel. Taste really good and not that sweet. The tarte passion framboise is too sweet for me and the pastry cup is not crispy enough.Absolutely incredible French pastries and desserts. They look like edible works of art. Very beautiful cafe and friendly service. It's a little pricey but well worth it. Treat yourself and go here!I was briefly visiting Montreal and decided that a trip to a pastry shop was in order. This is a small spot, but it's easy to find and there are a lot of options. I popped in there 30 minutes before it closed and it was pretty much empty. The young woman working there was very helpful whenever I asked her what some of the desserts were. I ended up choosing 3 different desserts and a couple of macarons, I paid around $25 for that. I got all of those to go, and they provided a nice to go box for me to carry my goods. Every single thing that I got was delicious! The macarons were heavenly, I regretted not getting more of them. Overall if you have a sweet tooth and enjoy tasty treats you won't be disappointed!Maison Christian Faure was recommended to us by the Omni concierge. He said it was a classical french pastry shop with an atelier on the second floor -- obviously, we had to check it out.The Illy coffee we had here was the best I had in my entire trip. The croissant was quite good, but I'm more used to a crusty croissant with a soft interior. This croissant was soft everywhere. Additionally, I ordered the quinoa salad; it was tasty and the vegetables were very fresh, but it was overly sweet.This place is a very cute place to hang out and get a pastry and some coffee, but I wouldn't order a meal here again.Delicious chocolate croissant and passion tart.  Very nice breakfast spot. Lots of pastries, desserts and coffee to pick from.Mother of God...what can I say...best desserts I've ever had. The club sandwich was delightful as well.It is the best backery I've ever been!

It's a interesting mix of cafe and pastry school and shop all in oneBad : The prices are a bit steep, but what can you expect from a renown pastry chef? Bottom Line: I will definitely be returning to this lovely spot if I am in the mood to spoil myself.This is definitely a destination you must visit in Montreal, we tried a little bit of everything and it was all amazing! My favorite was the macarons (in TONS of awesome colors and flavors), and the Chocolate Almond Croissant. We also took a bag of homemade marshmallows to go, which were very very good. The maple ones we got were a tad too sweet for my taste, so i'd probably just get the vanilla if i got more. Cant wait to be back in montreal so we can go here again!Cute place for brunch or a treat from the bakery -- You get into line and as you get closer to the cashier, you'll be asked if you're eating in. If take out, you stay in line. If eating in, the server will clear a table for you and bring you menus with the sandwich/salad options (not sure if you can order those items for take out, or only the pastries/bakery items). Our food:Brunch on the Plank: orange juice, croissant, eggs benedict on a choux pastry with smoked salmon, brioche "nanterre" with caramel sauce, mini fruit cup. The OJ was wonderful, definitely freshly squeezed. I didn't try the eggs benedict since the portion was so small - he said it was good, though the hollandaise sauce was different than the norm. The caramel sauce for the brioche was delicious and decadent. Fruit cup was mostly pineapple and melon.Crab/lobster salad on a choux pastry: amazing presentation and decent chunks of lobster meat evident, but the choux pastry itself didn't taste fresh. The croissant from the brunch on the plank was delicious enough that we ordered another - note that they are more soft/flaky than crispy.Lemonade: too tart for meTotal was $42 with taxes, before tip.I'm not sure if it is because I came here an hour before they close, or their service is just terrible all the time. The guy did not bother explaining any of their desserts (even after I asked what each one was), as they seem to be more concerned with closing the place on time than selling the rest of their desserts. We chose one of the pistachio cakes and a mango gelato from the fridge. I have no idea what was in the pistachio cake since the guy didn't bother to tell me at all... if that wasn't bad enough, they didn't have any plastic knifes or folks. It took asking 3 different staff members and 5 good minutes of waiting around for them to get a couple of folks. ** oh and there are seating areas but apparently they won't let you sit there an hour before they close since they close that area first. As for the actual desserts, they were alright. The cake was mediocre at best and the gelato was way too sweet. Maybe I didn't try the right desserts, but will not be returning.Food 5/5 decor 3/5 staff&service 3/5Great decor, had the chocolate croissant and the chocolatine, they were soooo good and fresh. Definetly intend on going there for brunch!!It says the coffee is ILLY. I feel It's not as good as these in ILLY store. For desserts, I like the pot caramel fleur de sel. Taste really good and not that sweet. The tarte passion framboise is too sweet for me and the pastry cup is not crispy enough.Absolutely incredible French pastries and desserts. They look like edible works of art. Very beautiful cafe and friendly service. It's a little pricey but well worth it. Treat yourself and go here!I was briefly visiting Montreal and decided that a trip to a pastry shop was in order. This is a small spot, but it's easy to find and there are a lot of options. I popped in there 30 minutes before it closed and it was pretty much empty. The young woman working there was very helpful whenever I asked her what some of the desserts were. I ended up choosing 3 different desserts and a couple of macarons, I paid around $25 for that. I got all of those to go, and they provided a nice to go box for me to carry my goods. Every single thing that I got was delicious! The macarons were heavenly, I regretted not getting more of them. Overall if you have a sweet tooth and enjoy tasty treats you won't be disappointed!Maison Christian Faure was recommended to us by the Omni concierge. He said it was a classical french pastry shop with an atelier on the second floor -- obviously, we had to check it out.The Illy coffee we had here was the best I had in my entire trip. The croissant was quite good, but I'm more used to a crusty croissant with a soft interior. This croissant was soft everywhere. Additionally, I ordered the quinoa salad; it was tasty and the vegetables were very fresh, but it was overly sweet.This place is a very cute place to hang out and get a pastry and some coffee, but I wouldn't order a meal here again.Delicious chocolate croissant and passion tart.  Very nice breakfast spot. Lots of pastries, desserts and coffee to pick from.Mother of God...what can I say...best desserts I've ever had. The club sandwich was delightful as well.It is the best backery I've ever been!

The restaurant/shop is very hip and stylish with a modern, bright atmosphere.  Apparently there is a baking school above the restaurant, with the production shop/kitchen downstairs.Every baked item we had here over two visits was amazing! I did the plain croissant twice because it may be the best that I have ever had, anywhere!  The first lunch I had here I enjoyed a lobster and crab salad in choux pastry...delicious! We did brunch here on our last day in Montreal (Saturday) and had the "benedict" - they offered either ham or smoked salmon.  Both were in choux pastry with a light foam on top in lieu of the normal hollandaise sauce (I had the ham and my wife had the salmon).  They were both a wonderful, light riff on the traditional beloved benedict!The joint also serves Illy coffee, which is generally a plus...they did great with cappucinos and with longhe espressos.The only gripe I have with the place was the service was a bit haphazard.  They would be very attentive, but then would just forget about you once the food was brought out...no more water refills, no checking to see if you wanted anything else, etc.  So, go for the food and live with the service...it isn't bad service, just less attentive than I would really like.On the whole though, I whole-heartedly recommend Maison Christian Faure to anyone looking for a good breakfast / lunch place in Montreal...we spent two meals on our foodie honeymoon in Quebec there, so I promise you that it is legit!After spending the majority of my Montreal trip in Le Plateau and other small surrounding hoods, I decided to venture into the more touristy area of Old Montreal to take in the sights. We started in the main downtown area walking along and decided to swing by Notre Dame on our way to the old port. In need of a coffee that wasn't from Starbucks we found this cafe.When we first walked in, there was a cluster of tourists jamming up the works. I don't know why but they were taking pictures of everything they could find and letting nobody through. This was a red flag, but we marched on. With the confusion it was tough to figure out if we were to go through the line or sit at a table. We found out we could sit but then it was almost ten minutes before anyone came to serve us. We could have just finished waiting in line at that point.Aside from the chaos on the way in, everything else was amazing. I had an amazing chocolate pot de creme and an americano. I would have stuck around for some macaroons, but everything was just taking too long and we needed to get moving. Pro Tip: The bathroom is up the elevator on the 4th floor.I actually wanna give them 1 star for being so unbelievably good yet not being in my hometown atlanta. I guess that isn't fair so a 5 star is due for their out of this world culinary dessert marvels.I'm not a dessert fanatic but this place can give a diabetic reason to forgo their sugar intake check. I can hardly recommend anything. We literally tried 6 items and each was just unique and great in its own. The building houses two floors of pastry school right on top of this beautiful restaurant.To make it even sweeter the staff is just very humble. It's better to go in between meal times as it can get super busy. We went in accidentally after lunch and were seated right away. Of course deciding which dessert to order was probably more difficult than learning to fly a plane. But just to throw out some recommendations the chocolate almond croissant is probably the best I've ever had. Of course don't even think about leaving without trying their raspberry tart. Don't know how they made it but it's cold like sorbet in the center yet the tart shell and cream on top blends the whole dessert so beautifully. They have a wide variety of food items too but unfortunately we could only savor their desserts and coffees. So which ever restaurant you dine at just remember to skip dessert and rush to this sweet heaven.This is my favourite pastry shop in Montreal without doubt! Their hazelnut eclair is my favourite. I make sure I stop by at this pastry shop every time I'm in old Montreal. Also, they have pastry school! Maybe coming here with loved one to make a cake would be a super good idea!If you want an authentic French pastry and Illy coffee, come here!!! This place is fantastic!!!The restaurant is owned by a chef who was named the best pastry chef in the world. You will soon find it why! I had the chocolate almond croissant. It was the best croissant I have ever had!My husband had the chocolate croissant and it was flaky, yummy, perfection.There is really not a bad thing in this place!Right near the Notre-Dame Basilica by the water is this cute and chic little pastry shoppe & cafe. We had the most delightful lunch here! The salmon sandwich is the best thing here -- comes with a poached egg and perfect smoked salmon with dill on a buttered (or mayoed?) bun. Their lobster & crab sandwich was good too, but I felt like the salmon was more satisfying. They show you a dessert tray for you to choose -- I chose a passion fruit & raspberry tart which was delicious. Also got a box of macarons to go! LOVED the lighting in this cafe and the simple decor. Huge ceiling-to-floor windows. Perfect for instagramming. Note: - Bathroom is on the 4th floor. - You pay at the front (even if you are dining in). - Macarons come in box of 6 or 12Fanciful pastry shoppe: -ghost chairs strewn throughout-gorgeous sugar display pieces-illy coffee -packaged marshmallows and sweets -gelato in the case-the flakiest, lightest croissant ever, must order!!!Brunch specials in the AM.  Limited savory menu starts at 11am.  If you like almond croissants, get there early, they were sold out at 10am today.  Tidbits: skip the Madeline.  Dry.  Bathrooms on the 4th floor.  The maple pastry is the second least sweet pastry next to the plain croissant.A friend once brought me as a date to an arts and culture event, where I mentioned that it was too bad there was no macaroons on the dessert table. The following week, he introduced me to Maison Christian Faure.Good : The place bright, clean and you can tell that it has quality pastries.

We did brunch here on our last day in Montreal (Saturday) and had the "benedict" - they offered either ham or smoked salmon.  Both were in choux pastry with a light foam on top in lieu of the normal hollandaise sauce (I had the ham and my wife had the salmon).  They were both a wonderful, light riff on the traditional beloved benedict!The joint also serves Illy coffee, which is generally a plus...they did great with cappucinos and with longhe espressos.The only gripe I have with the place was the service was a bit haphazard.  They would be very attentive, but then would just forget about you once the food was brought out...no more water refills, no checking to see if you wanted anything else, etc.  So, go for the food and live with the service...it isn't bad service, just less attentive than I would really like.On the whole though, I whole-heartedly recommend Maison Christian Faure to anyone looking for a good breakfast / lunch place in Montreal...we spent two meals on our foodie honeymoon in Quebec there, so I promise you that it is legit!After spending the majority of my Montreal trip in Le Plateau and other small surrounding hoods, I decided to venture into the more touristy area of Old Montreal to take in the sights. We started in the main downtown area walking along and decided to swing by Notre Dame on our way to the old port. In need of a coffee that wasn't from Starbucks we found this cafe.When we first walked in, there was a cluster of tourists jamming up the works. I don't know why but they were taking pictures of everything they could find and letting nobody through. This was a red flag, but we marched on. With the confusion it was tough to figure out if we were to go through the line or sit at a table. We found out we could sit but then it was almost ten minutes before anyone came to serve us. We could have just finished waiting in line at that point.Aside from the chaos on the way in, everything else was amazing. I had an amazing chocolate pot de creme and an americano. I would have stuck around for some macaroons, but everything was just taking too long and we needed to get moving. Pro Tip: The bathroom is up the elevator on the 4th floor.I actually wanna give them 1 star for being so unbelievably good yet not being in my hometown atlanta. I guess that isn't fair so a 5 star is due for their out of this world culinary dessert marvels.I'm not a dessert fanatic but this place can give a diabetic reason to forgo their sugar intake check. I can hardly recommend anything. We literally tried 6 items and each was just unique and great in its own. The building houses two floors of pastry school right on top of this beautiful restaurant.To make it even sweeter the staff is just very humble. It's better to go in between meal times as it can get super busy. We went in accidentally after lunch and were seated right away. Of course deciding which dessert to order was probably more difficult than learning to fly a plane. But just to throw out some recommendations the chocolate almond croissant is probably the best I've ever had. Of course don't even think about leaving without trying their raspberry tart. Don't know how they made it but it's cold like sorbet in the center yet the tart shell and cream on top blends the whole dessert so beautifully. They have a wide variety of food items too but unfortunately we could only savor their desserts and coffees. So which ever restaurant you dine at just remember to skip dessert and rush to this sweet heaven.This is my favourite pastry shop in Montreal without doubt! Their hazelnut eclair is my favourite. I make sure I stop by at this pastry shop every time I'm in old Montreal. Also, they have pastry school! Maybe coming here with loved one to make a cake would be a super good idea!If you want an authentic French pastry and Illy coffee, come here!!! This place is fantastic!!!The restaurant is owned by a chef who was named the best pastry chef in the world. You will soon find it why! I had the chocolate almond croissant. It was the best croissant I have ever had!My husband had the chocolate croissant and it was flaky, yummy, perfection.There is really not a bad thing in this place!Right near the Notre-Dame Basilica by the water is this cute and chic little pastry shoppe & cafe. We had the most delightful lunch here! The salmon sandwich is the best thing here -- comes with a poached egg and perfect smoked salmon with dill on a buttered (or mayoed?) bun. Their lobster & crab sandwich was good too, but I felt like the salmon was more satisfying. They show you a dessert tray for you to choose -- I chose a passion fruit & raspberry tart which was delicious. Also got a box of macarons to go! LOVED the lighting in this cafe and the simple decor. Huge ceiling-to-floor windows. Perfect for instagramming. Note: - Bathroom is on the 4th floor. - You pay at the front (even if you are dining in). - Macarons come in box of 6 or 12Fanciful pastry shoppe: -ghost chairs strewn throughout-gorgeous sugar display pieces-illy coffee -packaged marshmallows and sweets -gelato in the case-the flakiest, lightest croissant ever, must order!!!Brunch specials in the AM.  Limited savory menu starts at 11am.  If you like almond croissants, get there early, they were sold out at 10am today.  Tidbits: skip the Madeline.  Dry.  Bathrooms on the 4th floor.  The maple pastry is the second least sweet pastry next to the plain croissant.A friend once brought me as a date to an arts and culture event, where I mentioned that it was too bad there was no macaroons on the dessert table. The following week, he introduced me to Maison Christian Faure.Good : The place bright, clean and you can tell that it has quality pastries. They had a variety of macaroon flavors, and lots of delicious viennoiseries and confiseries ! It is a great place to stop for desserts and tea or to catch up with friends or even on a date since it's not to loud inside. And best believe it, the macaroons are amazing and has since raised the bar. It's a interesting mix of cafe and pastry school and shop all in oneBad : The prices are a bit steep, but what can you expect from a renown pastry chef? Bottom Line: I will definitely be returning to this lovely spot if I am in the mood to spoil myself.This is definitely a destination you must visit in Montreal, we tried a little bit of everything and it was all amazing! My favorite was the macarons (in TONS of awesome colors and flavors), and the Chocolate Almond Croissant. We also took a bag of homemade marshmallows to go, which were very very good. The maple ones we got were a tad too sweet for my taste, so i'd probably just get the vanilla if i got more. Cant wait to be back in montreal so we can go here again!Cute place for brunch or a treat from the bakery -- You get into line and as you get closer to the cashier, you'll be asked if you're eating in. If take out, you stay in line. If eating in, the server will clear a table for you and bring you menus with the sandwich/salad options (not sure if you can order those items for take out, or only the pastries/bakery items). Our food:Brunch on the Plank: orange juice, croissant, eggs benedict on a choux pastry with smoked salmon, brioche "nanterre" with caramel sauce, mini fruit cup. The OJ was wonderful, definitely freshly squeezed. I didn't try the eggs benedict since the portion was so small - he said it was good, though the hollandaise sauce was different than the norm. The caramel sauce for the brioche was delicious and decadent. Fruit cup was mostly pineapple and melon.Crab/lobster salad on a choux pastry: amazing presentation and decent chunks of lobster meat evident, but the choux pastry itself didn't taste fresh. The croissant from the brunch on the plank was delicious enough that we ordered another - note that they are more soft/flaky than crispy.Lemonade: too tart for meTotal was $42 with taxes, before tip.I'm not sure if it is because I came here an hour before they close, or their service is just terrible all the time. The guy did not bother explaining any of their desserts (even after I asked what each one was), as they seem to be more concerned with closing the place on time than selling the rest of their desserts. We chose one of the pistachio cakes and a mango gelato from the fridge. I have no idea what was in the pistachio cake since the guy didn't bother to tell me at all... if that wasn't bad enough, they didn't have any plastic knifes or folks. It took asking 3 different staff members and 5 good minutes of waiting around for them to get a couple of folks. ** oh and there are seating areas but apparently they won't let you sit there an hour before they close since they close that area first. As for the actual desserts, they were alright. The cake was mediocre at best and the gelato was way too sweet. Maybe I didn't try the right desserts, but will not be returning.Food 5/5 decor 3/5 staff&service 3/5Great decor, had the chocolate croissant and the chocolatine, they were soooo good and fresh. Definetly intend on going there for brunch!!It says the coffee is ILLY. I feel It's not as good as these in ILLY store. For desserts, I like the pot caramel fleur de sel. Taste really good and not that sweet. The tarte passion framboise is too sweet for me and the pastry cup is not crispy enough.Absolutely incredible French pastries and desserts. They look like edible works of art. Very beautiful cafe and friendly service. It's a little pricey but well worth it. Treat yourself and go here!I was briefly visiting Montreal and decided that a trip to a pastry shop was in order. This is a small spot, but it's easy to find and there are a lot of options. I popped in there 30 minutes before it closed and it was pretty much empty. The young woman working there was very helpful whenever I asked her what some of the desserts were. I ended up choosing 3 different desserts and a couple of macarons, I paid around $25 for that. I got all of those to go, and they provided a nice to go box for me to carry my goods. Every single thing that I got was delicious! The macarons were heavenly, I regretted not getting more of them. Overall if you have a sweet tooth and enjoy tasty treats you won't be disappointed!Maison Christian Faure was recommended to us by the Omni concierge. He said it was a classical french pastry shop with an atelier on the second floor -- obviously, we had to check it out.The Illy coffee we had here was the best I had in my entire trip. The croissant was quite good, but I'm more used to a crusty croissant with a soft interior. This croissant was soft everywhere. Additionally, I ordered the quinoa salad; it was tasty and the vegetables were very fresh, but it was overly sweet.This place is a very cute place to hang out and get a pastry and some coffee, but I wouldn't order a meal here again.Delicious chocolate croissant and passion tart.  Very nice breakfast spot. Lots of pastries, desserts and coffee to pick from.Mother of God...what can I say...best desserts I've ever had. The club sandwich was delightful as well.It is the best backery I've ever been! It has a great location in Old Montreal. Elegant French interior and friendly service. I got Eggs Benedict with salmon. it is he food of Kings, so tender and light with foam of bitten egg whites. .. omg. Almond croissant was undeliverable too. Very nice place for all ages.This" Magic Christian "Faure puts out some of the mostelegant and artfully crafted patisserie to be foundanywhere on the planet. He does it in his own Maisonthat is both sophisticated and unpretentious. So if you would like to experience fine dining in a pretty and cool bakery cafe setting this is the place to go.Our lunch here was fun, flavorful,and filling.We ordered the plat du jour special which includes  cafe and your choice of one of the marvelous looking and tasting pastries. We chose the smoked salmonClub sandwich which was served triple decker on thick slices of toasted Maison baked white bread, crusts removed. The smoked salmon layer was slathered in Christian's Mayonaise Maison and the upper layersurprised with a lightly fried egg ,lettuce and tomato.The sammich was accompanied by nicely done house potato chips and a small but tasty salad.For the pastry course our server came by with a tray of these most beautiful choices. It doesn't matter which One you choose. Your not going to find better.Chocolate hazelnut ganache..boom. Mille-Feuilles ;this is how we do!  BTW Christian Faure runs a pastryMaking school on the premises.So if you want the quality of having a lunch in a top French hotel restaurant or in a Boulud type place with out the stuffiness or the great expense this is it.It can get busy and service a little spotty but understandable given the attention to detail paid to the offerings here.Maison Christian Faure is, simply put, a gem!Located in the beautiful Old Town of Montreal across the street from the excellent Archaeological Museum this little pattiserie packs a huge punch! The restaurant/shop is very hip and stylish with a modern, bright atmosphere.  Apparently there is a baking school above the restaurant, with the production shop/kitchen downstairs.Every baked item we had here over two visits was amazing!
