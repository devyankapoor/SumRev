Excellent food in a cozy little place. We went there on a Monday night so it wasn't that busy.  We had the choice of sitting at the bar or table ; the opted for the bar where you can see the kitchen and the chefs cook.We started with a pickeled calamari & octopus salad ($15): delicious! For the main course, me and my friend shared the surf and turd for 2 which included a nice people of steak, shrimps and scallops and a side of butternut squash and beats...it was perfectly cooked and flavorful (/75)We also decided to share a bottle of red wine which did compliment our meal perfectly...they have  a wide selection of private italian wine.Our total bill came to about $100 each including tip...definitely a bit pricey but worth it. If you are looking for good food in a good atmosphere for a date,  this is definitely the place to go. I will be back for sure to try the rest of the menu...they change it on a regular basis. ..hope they will have the horse tartar next time I come back!Five stars in all departments.The feeling I got entering, whilst there, and leaving was all just so welcoming and real. The chef is soooooo committed to his clientele and it shows at every second. He is so relaxed while he cooks that it would make anyone at ease. The staff is all quite similar too; friendly, welcoming, knowledgable and honest.Gus is comfort food at its finest. The place itself is super cute. We sat at the bar and the whole dining experience was exactly that- an experience. I felt we went through adventures, both culinary and visual while there. Almost magical. I didn't want to leave. I wanted to move in.The oysters were perfect.The squid and octopus salad was very good- especially the octopus part- I would have made it only with octopus if I had the choice...The Caesar salad had crispy pancetta chunks and bread fried in olive oil that all blended and melted in my mouth.The onglet de boeuf had layers of flavour and the portions were all huge (as opposed to many of these new "tapas style" restos opening these days). The scalloped potatoes on that dish were so so good I can't even come close to describing them.The lemon tart was fabulous.Homemade baguette, homemade pickled pepper and homemade roasted corn relish all come on the side as delicious accompaniments. Oh- the cocktails are fantastic too!This restaurant totally has a Joe Beef vibe to it- meat, seafood, cozy, large portions, heart. If that's what you like in a culinary experience, go to Gus and I guarantee you won't be disappointed. I cannot wait to go back and I sure hope it doesn't change.When you're weary from traveling you usually get extra hungry and don't event realize it. When you reach this level of hunger and fatigue the last thing I know I want to do is make food decisions. My thought is "bring me a bit of everything and I'll figure it out". Now that's an expensive way of thinking but when your colleague is a neighborhood regular at a place like GUS, he or she will be able to order you the best of the menu and take the painful part out of making decisions. Last night I was able to enjoy a shareable selection of several delicious plates prepared by the expert chefs at GUS. To begin we nibbled on their complimentary thick sliced bread which paired perfectly (on the recommendation of the owner) with their house made corn relish. I actually could have eaten just that the rest of the night. Sweet and cool and a perfect way to soften the thick slightly sweet bread. Our first and second menu items to arrive were a Caesar salad and an order of calamari. The Caesar came as a massive portion more than enough for 3-4 of us to have more than a fair share. The dressing was freshly prepared and the croutons were huge holding their own against the dressing. The calamari was also very nice, served with some greens and done grilled as opposed to deep fried. It reminded me of Italian style antipasto calamari done in light oils and herbs.Then came the fois gras nachos. Holy hell these were RICH. The cheese, the fois, the toppings. I didn't even really care if there were chips under all that deliciousness or not - there were, but who cares! Loved this dish. I liked everything that was served to me until this point. The fatigue of the day and being a little tipsy on sparkling and flat white wines plus being a little full was all catching up to me. It was then I sort of entered into a dream like state and the main course was delivered. Surf and turf!! OMG!!! Thank goodness we were sharing this because the portion of meat, mash potatoes and seafood was insane. The well marbled and nearly fork tender steak was perfectly grilled and marinated, sat atop a bed of fluffy mashed potatoes. But that wasn't all, on top of that steak was arranged easily half a dozen large tiger shrimp and a half dozen equally large scallops. This entire dish was coated in a garlic-butter (and perhaps mustard) sauce that had me eating far beyond the realm of "need" and straight into the land of greed. I left fatter and happier as I imagine most patrons of GUS leave and slept better last night than I have in recent memory. Thanks to the staff for being amazing Live from Montreal - Eatcrest Out!When I'm back in Montreal, you'll definitely find me at Gus. Risa D took us there after dinner for a night cap and dessert... if there was any space at the bar. Just our luck, a few folks were on their way out and we grabbed some highly coveted seats at the bar. It was pretty but with Risa in tow, Dave welcomed us with open arms... literally. We told Dave we'd love to try a dessert or two and maybe a drink. Our waitress was a self proclaimed old fashioned expert so we accepted her challenge with a round of those. Next thing we know, one of every dessert comes out and placed in front of us to share. Dave wasn't a fan of us sharing just one or two and insisted we eat them all. Each one was phenomenal, but one was a variation on a creme brulee and was life changing. We ended up sticking around and getting to know Dave a little better while he heavy-handedly made sure our wine glasses were never empty. A great guy running a great place. I only wish we would have had a chance to do dinner there as well.If I lived in this hip area of Montreal, there's no doubt I'd be a Gus regular. Even as a temporary visitor, I felt the good natured charm that encapsulates your whole being at this French brasserie. We sat at the bar (aka, the best seats in the house) and were able to converse with Dave throughout our stay. Not only is he the Canadian doppelgänger to LCD Soundsystem's James Murphy, he's also a gentle giant with a nice dose of culinary creativity. That inventiveness extends to their cocktail program as well. Since I was there mostly as a barfly, the scale was tipped in the favor of Gus' libations.From a guy who grew up minutes from the Mexican border, let me tell you Dave makes a mean margarita. He knives through limes right in front of your face and adds a few magic touches to elevate this already refreshing elixir into something special. The same goes for the rhubarb slush (procured from the next door ice cream parlor) which he adds rum to for a nice muggy weather respite. Calamari toast acted as a refreshing palate cleanser between meals to fully embrace the flavor profiles of both drinks. All the while yukking it up with the bar and kitchen staff who are so close, you could reach out and hug them. It elicits a kind of community feel that can only be accomplished when done just right. As you might suspect, Gus cracked the code.Whether you're in Montreal, Poughkeepsie, or Tokyo, this is what a neighborhood restaurant should strive to be.This is my go to restaurant for every single mood and I have brought pretty much every food snob that I know to here and they all all left fully converted...not to mention stuffed! Sitting at the bar chatting and watching David is a delight. Marshmallow sweet potatoes, ceasar salad and fish of the day have been my major highlights so far out of the 10+ times I have dined here. The menu is small but ever changing and every ingredient is fresh. Bonus points for an open kitchen, I love these.They have lots of private import wines and beers to pick from which only adds to the cool factor of your meal, be sure to have a chat about what you like in a beer/wine and they will all make some recommendations that you won't regret. Of special note: the desserts here are fab, I personally am in love with the lemon tart nom nomAlso note: Thursday and Friday lunch is available and it is equally fantastic. The fish tacos and moules et frites: deeeelish!Gus! The first thing I thought of, naturally, was the fat mouse in Cinderella. I knew things were going to go well after that. We arrived to a beautiful and charming restaurant and were immediately seated. Our server switched flawlessly from French to English as they seem to do so well in this part of the world and as he listed the dishes, I knew we were in trouble. Give me all the things! Thankfully, Risa was able to pick some of the best items and order for us. Their salmon tartare was incredible. Perfectly fresh and gorgeous. We also enjoyed the octopus appetizer and though that's not typically my thing, it was savory, a little smoky and not at all chewy. And accompanying all of these are three hot salsas on the table. Apparently Dave makes them. His restaurant menu is littered with nods to the southwest (chipotle, serrano) and these three little delights were no exception. At that point, I'd gotten into my second cocktail. Their margaritas, Dave assured me, were as good as any I'd get in Texas. I had my doubts but when that fierce concoction arrived, I had to raise the white flag. It was perfect. As good or better than any I had growing up near the border of Mexico. A good margarita in Montreal may be hard to find - but Dave's got it down. Our mains were the pork and the (giant) steak with seafood. We may have over-ordered but by god, we we managed to eat every last bit of those delectable dishes. Then the dessert came. Seriously, trying to kill me. Thank goodness I had on leggings-as-pants or else things would have been dicey in the old button region. Our desserts were a dense chocolate cake with creamy frosting, some kind of de-constructed caramel-y apple dessert (tarte tartine?) and a lemon tart. I'm not even a dessert person and I was elbow deep, fighting for bites. Restaurant Gus is adorable and perfect for friends, a date night or that evening when you just want a glass of wine and a good dessert. When you go here, high five Dave and the staff because they're awesome.This place is simply divine. From the salmon tartare to the roast beef to the tarte, everything was made with care. It is one of those great places where the chef puts his heart into each dish. Everything was fresh and made with care. The ceasar salad was made fresh to order (even their pancetta is sliced to order), they home make so many of their sauces. It was my first time trying home made hot sauce and home made hot peppers sauce and both were super good. As for the ambience, it is cute and cozy, and if you sit at the bar you can watch the chef prepare your food. The wine selection is unique as you can try many wines not found in quebec. I came here with a friend and had a truly wonderful experience. These guys seem to love what they do, I can't wait to be back again.Had a really fantastic dinner here. The oysters were nice and fresh, our mains were out of this world (best caesar salad I've ever had), and the deserts were to die for! Definitely save room for the strawberry shortcake when you are there.Best fudgy chocolate cake with Baileys cream cheese frosting is beyond superb. Had it three times so far, two out of the three were just amazing. (Of course, their lamb shoulder too!) Anybody who undermines the value of Gus' chocolate cake is plain wrong. If you don't like the service (because you didn't like the way the waitress handled customers at another table because people were waiting in line), sitting at the bar seems like a good idea.The wine. THE WINE. The staff. The salmon tartar. The mussels. THE DESSERT. I can't actually remember what it was called but it has Jameson poured on top and I am speechless. I can't say enough about how much I enjoyed my meal at Restaurant Gus. Thanks to all of the staff who are amazing. I will be back!Great Place! Food is well prepared and each dish has it's own special flavor. We were a party of 6 and everyone loved it! The fish drew raves and the lamb was delicious. If you like a great ambiance, personable, entertaining and knowledgeable staff and a chef that is forging his own path,,,, this is it.The chef just wants you to be happy. It's a friendly and casual looking place but a lot of thought and attention to detail goes into the menu.Standouts: Foie gras tacos, Cesar salad, steaks.I agree one should sit at the bar.Only open for a few weeks, but I've been stalking the door for ages it feels like, waiting for Gus to open. Firstly bc it's in a part of my neighbourhood where I already love to spend time drinking and dining, picniking and knocking down pins; secondly because wise foodie friends from Enroute had tipped me off to this being the eventual new homebase for the crew from Jolifou a few months back; and thirdly because sometimes I dream in Surf n Turf. My dreams were not disappointed. Based on my experience last night I have the following tips:1. Sit at the bar, in the middle, so you are right in front of Dave Ferguson and can watch him make lovely food and run his kitchen and generally be charming and friendly and bossed up. There are hooks under the bar for your bags, and a coat rack up front, and the bar is wide and nicely spaced, so all will be well here. 2. Eat Caesar Salad. It's served in a good big bowl for sharing, with hunks of lovely toasted bread, capers, and pancetta with chillis on the side. The dressing is made in his grandmother's wooden bowl. I can't do justice the detail work that goes into the hows and whys of the homemade dressing, but it's all worth the time it takes and is comforting to watch. 3. Surf n' Turf for two, but could easily feed three with apps. Do it. Beautiful thick Nevada steak, juicy and soft and perfect, under a pile of giant shrimp and scallops in a perfect beurre blanc with poblano chillis. 4. Use the jars of homemade hot sauce and pickled chillis. Try them all, especially Mechant Carotte which is sweet backed up with Scotch Bonnet heat and is my new favourite thing. 5. Tarte tatin. I can't even talk about it. My heart is too full. They pour Jameson on top right before serving which seems designed to make a girl like me swoon. The joint is brand new so they are still getting their legs under them and figuring out the room, but it's warm, comfortable, elegant without being at all fussy. And as he pointed out, it's less than half the size of Jolifou, ie; small enough that David and Joshua (his wildly talented poet of a sous chef) are generally working on only one or two tickets at a time, and so have the brain space to chat and smile and hopefully enjoy the lovely experiences they are making all around them.I look forward to tucking in to Gus for wine and French Onion soup soon and often to ride out the end of the snowy season, and to seeing what they do come summer. Welcome to the neighbourhood!We are visiting Montreal and had a wonderful family dinner here tonight!  We would definitely return.  The food was fresh and seasonal, and the service was so friendly and accommodating to our family (which includes 3 kids).  The wine selection (we drank what the waitress suggested as pairings for our food) was delicious and our waitress was very helpful in navigating our need for gluten-free.  The homemade salsas/sauces on the table were divine (I suggest ordering fries to dip into all of the choices!).  What a lovely neighborhood gem!Had a wonderful meal here. Rib steak for two with herb butter and mushroom onion sauce was excellent, cooked to medium rare spot on, lightly coated with Montreal steak spice. Tuna steak lightly seared just right went well with lentils and mint. I am withholding a star because even though the wine list was interesting and extensive, only three reds were available by the glass, and the pour was nowhere near generous.One of the most delicious Cesar salads I've had, to date. Exquisite fois gras confit. Service was top notch to bootDiscovered this restaurant recently. We called in at 5 pm, hoping to get a reservation around 9 pm for 2 people and we got it. We did ask to sit at a table, but in the end, we sat at the bar. For starters, I ordered an old-fashioned cocktail... it was okay, not the best I've had.For entrees, we had the sausage/pieuvre one with the nachos/foie gras one. The pieuvre was tender, but the portion was really small. As for the nachos/foie gras, it was delicious. My boyfriend, who is picky, couldn't stop eating it.For our main course, we ordered the pork chop and the lamb. The meat was grilled to perfection and I liked their mashed potatoes. It was definitely worth eating there.For desserts, we got the chocolate cake which is topped with like a barley cheesecake mixture and the apple poudding chomeur. The desserts were not as sweet, so it was perfect for my palette. It was definitely the best desserts I've ever ate. The bill came out to be slightly expensive, but  it was worth the trip, since the waitresses were really attentive to us and the owner tried to talk to us as well to make us feel welcome. I would definitely return :)The very best little spot in Montréal - Gus and the entire staff are fantastic! Not to mention the food is always great! (I have been there a dozen times) - if I were you, I say you gotta try it!!Absolutely amazing. Delish cocktails, amazing seasonings and probably the best bavette I've ever had. All the while I was scarfing down this amazing meal I was able to watch the Habs on their bar-side television. The staff are so friendly and the chef went over the entire menu with me explaining every nuance and detail of his grub. Will definitely be back. It's also right next to Notre Dame des Quilles for a nightcap!I have been to this restaurant twice and like it a lot. The menu is not that long, but the focus is on seasonal ingredients (they do vegetables very well) and (for main courses) meat. There is a good wine list, with a lot of private imports. As for wine by the glass, on both occasions I was offered one that wasn't listed on the backboard. I'll be back for sure.Really enjoyed my experience at Gus.The restaurant is small so an intimate setting which is great, we sat at the bar, and we had a blast with the chef and waiter, very nice people and great conversation.As for the food, we shared the octopus as an entrée, it was perfectly cooked and tender, worthy of any spanish restaurant.  As a main I had the tartare which was very well seasoned, and the home fries divine.  Portions are generous so we were to full for desert.I will definitely go backSo we called up Gus restaurant, spoke to David Ferguson on a Friday afternoon to get a possible reservation for the same evening. Not a problem at the bar!  We arrive to be greeted by David, knowing him from Joli fou, we get our place at the bar right in front of David.We get a drink, take a look at the menu, friends had said it was more of a comfort food menu, decided on a gigot de agneau, and a confit de canard, a shrimp tempura to begin. The shrimp arrives tasteless, no flavour, no salt, no pepper, nothing, with a mango sauce dip, nothing to write home about!Then David calls the order to Josh for the main course, and Josh says last confit! Somehow a short while, 20 ,minutes later, David announces the confit was a mix up, somehow another table was served, he says it will be another 20 minutes? But remembering hearing that that was the last one, sounded strange, there would be another pulled out of the air or freezer? Possibly frozen, so it finally arrives, and is quite ordinary, the agneau does not measure up either, very chewy, but the over praised rapini vegetable of the day, is served sautéed for 30 seconds, raw, bitter, and no flavour! Not even a spec of salt? Leaving quite disappointed, wondering what had just transpired, walked home and felt an overwhelming feeling of illness, something with the canard was very off. Will confer with  friends to see if just maybe it was an off night for the place, or are we just better cooks ourselves?In a party of 4. Two of us had poisson du jour, scallops (yea I know), which were grilled & served on bed of polenta. Excellent. Scallops done to perfection & polenta creamy with slight nutty (hazelnut?) flavour.  We also had red beets & grilled red peppers. both a pleasure to consume.  One minor complaint, the Green salad was tasty with very good dressing but the type of arugula was mostly stem making it a challenge to eat (coming from someone who is not a picky eater).  Our first time to Gus but I don't expect our last, & I'll certainly recommend to friends heading to Montreal.I have been to this restaurant twice and like it a lot.
