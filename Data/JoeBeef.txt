How many times have I come to Montreal and NOT eaten here???  This place is amazing!!!  Fish of the day for two: perfectly cooked white fish in a butter wine sauce with roe mixed in, served with a side of clams and little potatoes.  Horse filet mignon (unreal), tender, cooked medium rare, it was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  Served with mashed potatoes.  Duck dish topped with a piece of foie gras.  This came with a side of vegetable but I cannot recall at this point.Even the soft serve ice cream was yummy.  A refreshing end to a most decadent meal.  Everything was fantastic.  I would come back here in an instant.  I would recommend it to everyone!I loved everything about this restaurant.  The food, the service... it was the highlight of my weekend!This place is exceptionally good!Geez- I don't know where to begin. Our table of four shared about a dozen dishes. The highlights being the Horse Tartare, a pasta with Fois Gras and deer shoulder, the smoked crispy fried trout, and the New York Strip with blue cheese.The cocktails were kinda meh.......... but the service and general experience was all on point.I would visit Joe Beef again in a heartbeat. It's one of the best dining experiences I have had.If I have a Jen K's Top 10 Restaurant List, Joe Beef would definitely be on it. And in fact, I might even able to say My Last Meal on Earth I want to have it here. (Yelp's profile question and they do serves uni!)I have been to Liverpool House, Joe Beef's sister restaurant right next door but Joe Beef is the real deal.The menu is seasonal but interesting. A mixture of seafood and meat and even vegetables. And of course foie gras!Everything we ordered were amazing. And the wait staff is just so knowledgeable with the menu and able to make awesome recommendations.The vibe is relaxing especially out on the back patio on a nice summer evening. And of these for a reasonable price! Just make sure you make a reservation ASAP, Joe Beef is just so popular and definitely worth all the hype!Joe Beef is really freakin' good.  It's been about 2 months since I've eaten there while vacationing in Montreal and I still think fondly back on it.The menu rotates pretty often - but for what it's worth - we grabbed the whole flounder with lobster bisque gravy (came with a side of mussels and lobster cream sauced veggies), slow-cooked lamb neck with sausage, seared scallops and foie gras parfait.Other than the scallops (which was fresh and perfectly cooked, but definitely hard to break the mold), everything else was exceptional.  The weirdest thing was the foie gras parfait - which was raw foie gras whipped with egg yolks and paired with tart (rather than sweet) cherries and cherry jam.  It was very strange (seriously, foie for a 'dessert' appetizer) but it worked.  It came in a big bowl so whatever we didn't have on the bread was added as a topping to everything else.  I wish the lamb neck was a bit gamier, but still excellent.  Finally, the flounder was spectacular.Service was excellent.  We were immediately seated after confirming our reservation (if you are planning a trip - do make reservations well in advance).  The service was atypical - friendly but very relaxed.  The menu board is extremely difficult for non-French speakers to read due to the dim lights.  Our waiter just told us he recommended 'everything' but was very knowledgeable, answered all our questions and gauged our appetites well as he told us to stop ordering as he was confident we had 'more than enough' food and he was right.  He really steered us to configure an optimal meal that satisfied everyone at the table considering some unique dietary restrictions.Also, the meal was surprisingly affordable.  With everything mentioned and two beers, the bill came to $65 each for the four of us - tax and tip included.Easily the best restaurant I've been to in Canada.Did not live up to the hype for me: *the smoked meat croquettes were little salt bombs and a bit one note for me.  The sliced pickles just added to the sodium.*seemed dingy inside and there were flies in the restaurant, but thought all the knick knacks strewn throughout were nice photo ops*the horse tartare is phenomenal, loved the shaved matsutakes and the brioche, heavenly.  Best red meat tartare I have ever had.  *if you must get the lobster pasta, get the half portion, it was just okay, pasta al dente, the shellfish could have been better, heavy, creamy, could have used more fresh herbs and again, a lot of the same flavor*veal, escargot and bone marrow, impressive looking dish and was more like short rib type meat than a steak-just falls apart.  Very good and very rich.  Tip: take a photo of the chalkboard and read the menu from your device.  Everyone was struggling and craning their necks.  It's been rather warm the last week, no AC at JB.  Loved our little window nook booth, but I think the garden would have been a great alternative.Reasonable pricing $160 CAD for 4 items, 2 glasses of wine, tax and tip.  We were stuffed.  Great servers and interesting meal, but my least favorite planned meal of the trip.This is my second favorite restaurant in Montreal, ranked only below it's sister restaurant, Liverpool House. Before I get into my review, first, a confession. I came here, too, because of Anthony Bordain. I am not proud of it, I wish I was a cool-kid Montreal-er, but alas I am merely a uni-lingual American.  In fact, my boyfriend and I designed a whole vacation around getting a reservation at Joe Beef. The atmosphere: Joe Beef is simultaneously sexy and casual. It has dark mood lighting, but hockey memorabilia decor. They play Neil Young and French singers I do not recognize. Your plates and glasses are mismatched, and appear to come from a cool thrift store. The bar is boisterous-  ladies cackling, men singing, loud debates amounting, etc. ( an example from our dinner: whether Americans are bigger prudes than Canadians). The staff are irreverent and knowledgeable. Almost all of them seem to have a gleam of mischievous in their eyes. The Food: I ordered some sort of lamb sausage plate, the cocktail of the day (x3), and PEI oysters. My other half ordered the pheasant and wine. We were both very happy. If I had to describe the food, I'd say it was decedent,and intense. My lamb dish was so huge, it presented like a dare. It wasn't prepared like your usual lamb, in that it was not Mediterranean inspired. It actually reminded me a lot of the food I ate in Prague - made to keep you full and warm. It had a dark aroma - of spices I did not recognize but enjoyed. The Oysters were meaty and briny, and served with a very spicy homemade hot sauce. The star of our night was desert, Marjolaine (a painstaking, many-layered chocolate and hazelnut cake). It was the best desert I've ever had in my life. For those Anthony Bordain fans morjolaine was featured in the No Reservations, Quebec episode. There is also a recipe for it in Joe Beef's cookbook. Anyways, making a pilgrimage to Joe Beef should definitely be on any foodie's vacation itinerary. The food, atmosphere, and service were wonderful. I felt right at home in my comfy booth, tearing through animal parts and slogging beer.Food 5 / 5 decor 5 / 5 service 5 / 5 We were 4, made reservations 2 months prior. Everything about the experience was perfection, one of the best part of joe beef is that you get top notch quality without the snootiness. You can get there in a suit, or in sweats, it won't matter because everyone is there for one reason: hearty, meaty, and delicious cuisine du terroir. The staff knows the food inside out as if they've cooked everything themselves.1. Smoked trout 26$2. Duck terrine 17$3. Large pulled pork with butternut squash gnocchis (regular 27$ large 40.50$) 4. Roasted Fowl 66$5. Side of bone marrow 16$6. Order of fries with parmesan flakes 8$7. Pear pie with housemade Pear and clove ice cream 16$+ 2 bottles of wine (white 65$ and red 65$)+ 3 coffees (3$ each)Everything above was shared. With tax and a 15% tip our total was 435$. For me, the pulled pork stole the show,  it's as if the meat just melted in your mouth, it was so tender. And the ice cream I would buy by the gallon if I could.It's been a while since I wrote a review but I've been busy enjoying life.  Anyways, here goes a review of a highly recommended restaurant I went in Montreal earlier this month.  I came with a friend I haven't seen since college so needless to say, there was a lot we had to catch up on.The setting is quite intimate but it didn't hinder a good conversation.  What we didn't like was the menu.  It is a blackboard hung up high in the wall and written in French only.  The handwriting was like a doctor's prescription and the blackboard was not properly erased so it made reading the menu immensely difficult (not to mention I didn't bring my glasses or read French).I thought the service was ok.  My friend thought our server was a little pretentious.  Anyhow, at least they offered to sell me a half portion of their famous lobster spaghetti.  That allowed me to enjoy some oysters and Canadian sea urchin (uni) as appetizer.  It would be too much food otherwise.  Taste-wise, everything was on par and predictable.It is a pricey place so do save it for a special occasion.  Reservation necessary.As I watched our cheerful server patiently (and entertainingly) translate the French-language menu in its entirety, I was at first dubious, then astonished, and finally delighted.  It was a glimpse into the workings of an establishment of humble origins that has gained acclaim as one of Canada's premier restaurants.The service here is genuinely welcoming.  I am reminded of the graciousness that defines hospitality at a Danny Meyer restaurant.  Without hovering, our servers were there when needed.  From a fine wine list dominated by bottles in the triple digits, our server swiftly ascertained our preference for a lower end choice, then narrowed down a flavor profile in just a brief, bantering exchange.  It was near worth ordering a second bottle for.An argument can be made for two bottles.  Although renowned as a meat-centric restaurant, Joe Beef is equally at ease with seafood, so a sampling of both is reasonable.  One of their more impressive starters were two whole, small trout showered with seasonally fresh vegetables.  The tender meat is gently smoked, yielding a flavor that is surprisingly restrained: enough to accent, not enough to dominate.  Shellfish shined in an equally wonderful sausage of lobster and clams; plump, juicy, and brimming with the flavors of its ingredients.  If the starter menu isn't enough, a few quality, local raw bar options are offered.  Raw oysters are de rigueur, but more interesting was a fresh uni prepared in a light tomato sauce and served in its shell, or the sweet snow crab legs.Of course, it would be sinful to eschew meat at Joe Beef, which offers up a few sharable beef entrees, along with foie gras, Canadian smoked meat, duck, rabbit, horse, lamb, and chicken dishes.  Foie gras parfait is flawless; creamy and luxurious, perfectly offset by a bite of crisp, sharp radish on warm, crusty brioche.  The same brioche is molded like a nest around smooth horse tartare, although robust seasoning muffled the sweetness of raw horse.  Simple, expertly cooked duck breast was a marvel of flavor and succulence.It is easy to see how this utterly charming restaurant is as famed as it is.  It is not for a specific dish, gimmick, or personality.  With its constantly changing menu penned only on chalkboard, Joe Beef announces its allegiance to local, seasonal foods, and prepares them exceptionally well.  Add to that the warmth of the staff and a uniquely home-like atmosphere between its cozy, tavern-like space inside and a festive outdoor area reminiscent of a patio.  It makes for a highly enjoyable, low-key dining experience that seems effortless in execution yet must surely be anything but.  And it will have one thinking about a return visit as soon as possible.I LOVED our waitress! She was so friendly and down-to-earth. - I made my reservations 3 months in advance (that's the earliest you can make it) - It's a dimly-lit, tiny restaurant, very homey and intimate - They played some great music while we were there (biggie smalls and some frenchy music)- The menu is written on the chalkboard (behind people sitting in the restaurant) - just take a picture with your smart phone and look at the menu from your seat instead of cranking your neck around and struggling to read it - The waitress encourages you to get up from your seat to look at the menu and she can answer any questions or give you recommendations - Duck for 2 ($90) is HUGE and worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It comes with 2 pieces of foie gras and a duck leg (confit), and like a whole freakin duck. It was SO good. We couldn't finish and I was really sad. HUGE portions. - Corn chowder was delicious too - For dessert, I picked ice cream with concord grapes - it was very good. - I also got to pick at my neighbor's cake (we became friends after sitting so close for 2 hours) - 12 layers of buttercream As with any other French restaurants in Montreal, your meal will probably last 2 hours or longer.We were able to get a last minute reservation here the day of for 9ish. We thought we had lucked out. In some ways we did, in some ways we didn't.  It was a great meal but it was crazy expensive. I was under the impression that this place was small but it has expanded to a full rowhouse so capacity was not a problem. Couples shuffled in and out and there were 1 or 2 empty tables near us the entire time. It was kind of cramped as we were crammed in there. We were seated at a 2 top between 2 couples in the back. Our server was lovely and gave us great choices. It was so dark in there and the writing on the board is so narrow and squiggly there is no way you can see the board so you are completely at the server's mercy when it comes to food and wine choices. The choices she gave us was excellent tho but the prices were tremendously inflated. We got a CAD $110 bottle of wine which I found out on the internet was really a USD $38 bottle of wine so I guess it was the standard markup. We had a Great froie gras appetizer and I had the blue cheese rabbit while hubby had a steak that came overcooked. The server asked him about it and he said it was ok but she took the liberty of sending it back and giving him a rare one instead. I didn't know this at the time but for the prices we were about to pay, it was par for the course. His new steak took a while to come. So 2 bottles of wine, 1 appetizer and 2 main courses, 1 salad and a fruit dessert set us back  400 CAD.  It was about 14 CAD for a side salad add on and similar for a berries dessert with cream. They did give us a small complimentary tasting of another wine for the steak mishap. So...it was good but I'm not sure if it was $400 good. I LOVE French Canadian food and have eaten my way through Quebec City on two occasions not having paid nearly as much in a couple of days than what we did tonight. To make myself feel better, I just looked up the exchange rate so the meal was about 300 USD which sits a lot better in my stomach. Still, Joe Beef is kind of overrated but I'm glad we did it. If we were to come back, I'd definitely only have 1 bottle of wine, and skip the expensive extras like dessert and salad.After an anxious six week wait, the night finally came for dinner at Joe Beef! Pros:1. Service is impeccable. All of the staff is very knowledgeable, in-tune with the menu and attentive to allergies. They checked back at just the right frequency. No complaints at all here. 2. Food is definitely above average. Snow crab legs were incredible -- As our server said, they are in season right now so they were very sweet and didn't even need condiments. The lamb sausage was a tad too salty in my opinion and could have used more starch or veggie on the side to balance that out. The strip steak was flavourful but a little more tough than expected. The fries were cute in a mini Creuset but pretty standard in terms of taste. Cons: 1. Menu is only in French and on the blackboard. Being fully bilingual, I didn't mind at all that the menu was in French. More importantly, I just don't think it is practical to have the only version of the menu on the single blackboard that half the restaurant has their back up against. The ONLY thing that partially made up for it was the detail-oriented servers who could cater to individual questions. It just seemed like a bit of a drag for the server to repeat the menu so many times. 2. In terms of value, sad to say that Joe Beef didn't live up to the hype this time. I'm all about paying good money for dinner but we both agreed that the meal just didn't live up to the long wait for reservations and the price.To try next time: - Lobster spaghetti - Rib steak for 2Lives up to the hype. Other than my appetizer being a little over seasoned (fresh pasta with venison), I only have good things to say. Our waitress did an excellent job guiding us through a somewhat cryptic menu on the chalk board and the end result was a memorable three course dinner. The next time a friend from out of town asks me where they should eat when they come to Montreal, I'll probably tell them to go to Joe Beef.Oh my God, Yumm!My Buddy had been frothing at the mouth to come up to Montreal and try this spot. Wouldn't stop talking about it, ha ha.So we did.We started with the Horse Tar Tar, and tell you the truth, with enough of it, that could have been my meal, it was soooooo goooooood!He had the steak, I had the lamb.  The lamb was good, not great.  His steak was to die for. For sure I will be back and have the steak.Tip: the servers in Canada are quite honest about what's good and tasty on the menu, so if they suggest anything, go for it! We almost balked at the horse tar tar, and it ended up being other-wordly!A good restaurant, but not a great one at the time of my visit.We were able to squeeze in a reservation for two at the bar, and were very excited given all the hype this restaurant has. But it just didn't meet those expectations for me. We each had a glass of wine, then followed with the local buffalo mozzarella appetizer which came with 2 slivers of fish and 2 slices of rye toast. The cheese was lovely, but nothing to write home about; it's fresh mozzarella? Next we had the smoked meat croquettes which were really good, easily the highlight of the meal -- it's everything you love about smoked meat squished up into a little tater-tot sized bite with a pickle on top. For entrees, we split the gentleman's steak with bleu cheese and while it was extremely well cooked (rare) it was really pricey for what amounted to a properly cooked steak with a scoop of garlic spinach on the side. However the portion is huge, so if you split it between two it's actually pretty reasonable. For dessert we had the strawberry and pistachio gratin, which was hyped up a lot by the bar staff. The berries were too early to be flavorful so they macerated them in sugar to increase the flavor. The creamy pistachio flan was amazing though! In all, it was a meal with highs (pistachio flan in the strawberry dessert & smoked meat croquettes) and okay points. For a restaurant of it's reputation, we expected more. The ambiance is great, the staff is helpful, but if you're and english speaker you're out of luck -- the menu is in french and only written on one chalkboard. Thankfully I speak french and was able to get by, but I can see how it's hard for others.Great place, note that the menu is 100% in French.One of the single best meals I've ever had. I know it either had to be amazing or grossly overrated as we made reservations 2.5 months in advance and could only score a table at 10PM on a Thursday evening. Needless to say, I had very high expectations for Joe Beef and JB graciously blew those expectations out of the water. The whole menu is in French on a chalkboard on the wall. Luckily, I picked up some French in High School and College and was able to navigate our nosh options well enough. If French wasn't your thang in school then the waiters will give ya a hand with the translation. We also did our homework and mostly knew what we wanted. The goods: We ordered some of the house pickles along with some of their housemade sourdough with butter which were a delicious beginning to the meal. Next was the sliced ham with mushrooms. I have to say this was one of the best bites of food I have ever had the pleasure of consuming. The ham was so wonderfully soft and fresh. The mushrooms were exploding with flavor and then there was a drizzle of a light cream sauce over top. This dish was absolutely divine. Next came the Lobster Spaghetti. If you think you're too old for spaghetti, get over it and order this right now! GIant chunks of lobster + claws served in a heavy cream sauce with over spaghetti. It was so heavy, but worth every artery clogging bite!For dessert we ordered a Strawberry dish that was absolutely incredible. The Strawberries are shipped down from a farm just north of Montreal and they were so amazingly tart, tangy, and fresh. It made me feel as if I had never tasted a strawberry before and I was tasting them for the first time. Yes, sounds exaggerated but it was that good! Our waiter Patrick was absolutely wonderful! He was great on offering suggestions (we asked him to suggest the appetizer for us). He was hysterical, kind, and super quirky.   Perfect meal in the heart of Little Burgundy.Come here prepared to for meat and calorie overload!  But it is exceptionally good and the service was remarkable.  Very simply if you're traveling to the Montreal area you have to go to Joe Beef.  Oh, but plan ahead, they were booked 2 months in advance. I just got lucky with getting a last minute seat at the bar.This place is amazing.  It epitomizes everything you would want in a restaurant named Joe Beef and combines it with impeccable service, awesome attitude and a great ambiance.  Joe Beef isn't a large space (I believe there are two sides) so reservations are a must.  We had a party of 8 reserved into two groups of 4, but the hostess didn't drop a beat when we told her 2 in our party were delayed.  She seated us in an awesome table for 6 but most importantly paired us with one of the best waitresses I've ever had.  She clearly saw that we were tourists, but that's one thing that I loved about Montreal.  Many of the cool places that we went to, they welcome and are friendly to tourists and this place was no different.  It looked like it was full of French Canadians, but you couldn't tell as they effortlessly switched from English to French catering to their customer.  The menu is a revolving one and written only on the chalkboard nightly, so describing the dishes accurately is almost impossible.  Suffice it to say everything was amazing and it was easily one of the best meat-centric meals I've had in my life.  I was in heaven.  We started off with drinks and I never saw a cocktail menu but the waitress was able to order everyone drinks they loved based on just a brief description of base drink preference (ie: gin, vodka, etc.)  The drinks are strong and tasty and while perhaps not as complex as the artisinal cocktails we had at Lab just before, they were good.  I had no idea how much they cost either.  Then we started off with appetizers.  She knew we were familiar with the famous Foie Gras double down but informed us they no longer sold it.  She saw our sad faces and said would order a selection that would make us happy.  Our waitress never pushed any item (ie: their oysters are famous, but we didn't feel like any) and it really was one of the most fun and engaging ordering experiences I've had.  Foie Gras Small Bites - deep fried and filled with tiny bits of foie gras and potato.  Delicious.  This place knows meat, fried, and smoked.Mozzarella served with Toast - fresh mozzarella cheese sliced and served with toast.  A nice change and balance to all the meat.Sunnyside up Duck Eggs with Pomme Frites - I've never had eggs this good and I've sous vide many eggs. This was better.  It was super rich, seasoned perfectly and the fries were amazing.Foie Gras And Ham Sandwich - this was to make up for the double down.  Split 6 ways, we each only got a small bite, but the salty foie gras sauce and milder ham went with the decant biscuit bread with sauce.  Puff Pastry with Smoked Turkey - our waitresses favorite appetizer.  It was good but tasted a bit like turkey with small bread puffs.  Not interesting enough.Minced Duck and Seared Foie Gras - the duck looked like a steak but broke into parts of duck meat.  The seared foie gras on top was delicious and the berry sauce was a perfect contrast.  Venison Sausage - loved it.  Did I say they do meats well?Lobster Spaghetti - another famous dish.  Whole lobster with cream sauce and perfect al dente noodles.  One of my favorites of the night.  Seared Rib Eye Steak - seasoned perfectly, cooked perfectly, finished completely.Horse Meat Filet Mignon - wrapped with bacon and served with potatoes.  This was a novelty as I've never had horse meat.  Cooked perfectly medium rare the meat was delicious and a very different texture than any meat I've had.  Worth trying once.  Deep Fried Cauliflower - covered in cheese but an obligatory vegetable.Lamb Steak - yet another meat, cooked so perfectly and completely different flavor.  Duck Fat Fries - the perfect starch to complement the meat.  We were too full from drink and food for dessert but finished our meal with laughter with the staff learning French phrases, sharing the best spots for food and merriment and finishing with shots on the house.  Our bill wasn't cheap but the final price was less than I guessed.  It also was one of the best meat meals I've had in my life.  I missed Au Pied du Cochon but I don't think I would have wanted to trade away Joe Beef.  Joe Beef accepts credit cards.A pure 5 star rating without a doubt in my mind. We came to Montreal to specifically go to Joe Beef and it was certainly worth it! Rated one of the most difficult places to get a reservation, we booked many moons ahead of time. Upon arrival, we noticed all the menu items were written on a chalk board. Having poor vision, combined with dimmed lighting, I opted to go with the chefs choice for 6 courses.  It relieved us of the stress of deciding what we should share while adding a layer of anticipation and surprise.  Out waiter was terrific as he attended multiple tables with his cat shirt in celebration of National Cat Day.Favorite dishes: bone marrow, calamari stuffed with meat in a red wine mushroom sauce and apple donuts with smoked Gouda.While everything was perfectly cooked, a bit too salty on some of the more savory items.  Just a general preference of mine, but it didn't stop me from eating everything!How many times have I come to Montreal and NOT eaten here???  This place is amazing!!!  Fish of the day for two: perfectly cooked white fish in a butter wine sauce with roe mixed in, served with a side of clams and little potatoes.  Horse filet mignon (unreal), tender, cooked medium rare, it was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  Served with mashed potatoes.  Duck dish topped with a piece of foie gras.  This came with a side of vegetable but I cannot recall at this point.Even the soft serve ice cream was yummy.  A refreshing end to a most decadent meal.  Everything was fantastic.  I would come back here in an instant.  I would recommend it to everyone!I loved everything about this restaurant.  The food, the service... it was the highlight of my weekend!This place is exceptionally good!Geez- I don't know where to begin.

For me, the pulled pork stole the show,  it's as if the meat just melted in your mouth, it was so tender. And the ice cream I would buy by the gallon if I could.It's been a while since I wrote a review but I've been busy enjoying life.  Anyways, here goes a review of a highly recommended restaurant I went in Montreal earlier this month.  I came with a friend I haven't seen since college so needless to say, there was a lot we had to catch up on.The setting is quite intimate but it didn't hinder a good conversation.  What we didn't like was the menu.  It is a blackboard hung up high in the wall and written in French only.  The handwriting was like a doctor's prescription and the blackboard was not properly erased so it made reading the menu immensely difficult (not to mention I didn't bring my glasses or read French).I thought the service was ok.  My friend thought our server was a little pretentious.  Anyhow, at least they offered to sell me a half portion of their famous lobster spaghetti.  That allowed me to enjoy some oysters and Canadian sea urchin (uni) as appetizer.  It would be too much food otherwise.  Taste-wise, everything was on par and predictable.It is a pricey place so do save it for a special occasion.  Reservation necessary.As I watched our cheerful server patiently (and entertainingly) translate the French-language menu in its entirety, I was at first dubious, then astonished, and finally delighted.  It was a glimpse into the workings of an establishment of humble origins that has gained acclaim as one of Canada's premier restaurants.The service here is genuinely welcoming.  I am reminded of the graciousness that defines hospitality at a Danny Meyer restaurant.  Without hovering, our servers were there when needed.  From a fine wine list dominated by bottles in the triple digits, our server swiftly ascertained our preference for a lower end choice, then narrowed down a flavor profile in just a brief, bantering exchange.  It was near worth ordering a second bottle for.An argument can be made for two bottles.  Although renowned as a meat-centric restaurant, Joe Beef is equally at ease with seafood, so a sampling of both is reasonable.  One of their more impressive starters were two whole, small trout showered with seasonally fresh vegetables.  The tender meat is gently smoked, yielding a flavor that is surprisingly restrained: enough to accent, not enough to dominate.  Shellfish shined in an equally wonderful sausage of lobster and clams; plump, juicy, and brimming with the flavors of its ingredients.  If the starter menu isn't enough, a few quality, local raw bar options are offered.  Raw oysters are de rigueur, but more interesting was a fresh uni prepared in a light tomato sauce and served in its shell, or the sweet snow crab legs.Of course, it would be sinful to eschew meat at Joe Beef, which offers up a few sharable beef entrees, along with foie gras, Canadian smoked meat, duck, rabbit, horse, lamb, and chicken dishes.  Foie gras parfait is flawless; creamy and luxurious, perfectly offset by a bite of crisp, sharp radish on warm, crusty brioche.  The same brioche is molded like a nest around smooth horse tartare, although robust seasoning muffled the sweetness of raw horse.  Simple, expertly cooked duck breast was a marvel of flavor and succulence.It is easy to see how this utterly charming restaurant is as famed as it is.  It is not for a specific dish, gimmick, or personality.  With its constantly changing menu penned only on chalkboard, Joe Beef announces its allegiance to local, seasonal foods, and prepares them exceptionally well.  Add to that the warmth of the staff and a uniquely home-like atmosphere between its cozy, tavern-like space inside and a festive outdoor area reminiscent of a patio.  It makes for a highly enjoyable, low-key dining experience that seems effortless in execution yet must surely be anything but.  And it will have one thinking about a return visit as soon as possible.I LOVED our waitress! She was so friendly and down-to-earth. - I made my reservations 3 months in advance (that's the earliest you can make it) - It's a dimly-lit, tiny restaurant, very homey and intimate - They played some great music while we were there (biggie smalls and some frenchy music)- The menu is written on the chalkboard (behind people sitting in the restaurant) - just take a picture with your smart phone and look at the menu from your seat instead of cranking your neck around and struggling to read it - The waitress encourages you to get up from your seat to look at the menu and she can answer any questions or give you recommendations - Duck for 2 ($90) is HUGE and worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It comes with 2 pieces of foie gras and a duck leg (confit), and like a whole freakin duck. It was SO good. We couldn't finish and I was really sad. HUGE portions. - Corn chowder was delicious too - For dessert, I picked ice cream with concord grapes - it was very good. - I also got to pick at my neighbor's cake (we became friends after sitting so close for 2 hours) - 12 layers of buttercream As with any other French restaurants in Montreal, your meal will probably last 2 hours or longer.We were able to get a last minute reservation here the day of for 9ish. We thought we had lucked out. In some ways we did, in some ways we didn't.  It was a great meal but it was crazy expensive. I was under the impression that this place was small but it has expanded to a full rowhouse so capacity was not a problem. Couples shuffled in and out and there were 1 or 2 empty tables near us the entire time. It was kind of cramped as we were crammed in there. We were seated at a 2 top between 2 couples in the back. Our server was lovely and gave us great choices. It was so dark in there and the writing on the board is so narrow and squiggly there is no way you can see the board so you are completely at the server's mercy when it comes to food and wine choices. The choices she gave us was excellent tho but the prices were tremendously inflated. We got a CAD $110 bottle of wine which I found out on the internet was really a USD $38 bottle of wine so I guess it was the standard markup. We had a Great froie gras appetizer and I had the blue cheese rabbit while hubby had a steak that came overcooked. The server asked him about it and he said it was ok but she took the liberty of sending it back and giving him a rare one instead. I didn't know this at the time but for the prices we were about to pay, it was par for the course. His new steak took a while to come. So 2 bottles of wine, 1 appetizer and 2 main courses, 1 salad and a fruit dessert set us back  400 CAD.  It was about 14 CAD for a side salad add on and similar for a berries dessert with cream. They did give us a small complimentary tasting of another wine for the steak mishap. So...it was good but I'm not sure if it was $400 good. I LOVE French Canadian food and have eaten my way through Quebec City on two occasions not having paid nearly as much in a couple of days than what we did tonight. To make myself feel better, I just looked up the exchange rate so the meal was about 300 USD which sits a lot better in my stomach. Still, Joe Beef is kind of overrated but I'm glad we did it. If we were to come back, I'd definitely only have 1 bottle of wine, and skip the expensive extras like dessert and salad.After an anxious six week wait, the night finally came for dinner at Joe Beef! Pros:1. Service is impeccable. All of the staff is very knowledgeable, in-tune with the menu and attentive to allergies. They checked back at just the right frequency. No complaints at all here. 2. Food is definitely above average. Snow crab legs were incredible -- As our server said, they are in season right now so they were very sweet and didn't even need condiments. The lamb sausage was a tad too salty in my opinion and could have used more starch or veggie on the side to balance that out. The strip steak was flavourful but a little more tough than expected. The fries were cute in a mini Creuset but pretty standard in terms of taste. Cons: 1. Menu is only in French and on the blackboard. Being fully bilingual, I didn't mind at all that the menu was in French. More importantly, I just don't think it is practical to have the only version of the menu on the single blackboard that half the restaurant has their back up against. The ONLY thing that partially made up for it was the detail-oriented servers who could cater to individual questions. It just seemed like a bit of a drag for the server to repeat the menu so many times. 2. In terms of value, sad to say that Joe Beef didn't live up to the hype this time. I'm all about paying good money for dinner but we both agreed that the meal just didn't live up to the long wait for reservations and the price.To try next time: - Lobster spaghetti - Rib steak for 2Lives up to the hype. Other than my appetizer being a little over seasoned (fresh pasta with venison), I only have good things to say. Our waitress did an excellent job guiding us through a somewhat cryptic menu on the chalk board and the end result was a memorable three course dinner. The next time a friend from out of town asks me where they should eat when they come to Montreal, I'll probably tell them to go to Joe Beef.Oh my God, Yumm!My Buddy had been frothing at the mouth to come up to Montreal and try this spot. Wouldn't stop talking about it, ha ha.So we did.We started with the Horse Tar Tar, and tell you the truth, with enough of it, that could have been my meal, it was soooooo goooooood!He had the steak, I had the lamb.  The lamb was good, not great.  His steak was to die for. For sure I will be back and have the steak.Tip: the servers in Canada are quite honest about what's good and tasty on the menu, so if they suggest anything, go for it! We almost balked at the horse tar tar, and it ended up being other-wordly!A good restaurant, but not a great one at the time of my visit.We were able to squeeze in a reservation for two at the bar, and were very excited given all the hype this restaurant has. But it just didn't meet those expectations for me. We each had a glass of wine, then followed with the local buffalo mozzarella appetizer which came with 2 slivers of fish and 2 slices of rye toast. The cheese was lovely, but nothing to write home about; it's fresh mozzarella? Next we had the smoked meat croquettes which were really good, easily the highlight of the meal -- it's everything you love about smoked meat squished up into a little tater-tot sized bite with a pickle on top. For entrees, we split the gentleman's steak with bleu cheese and while it was extremely well cooked (rare) it was really pricey for what amounted to a properly cooked steak with a scoop of garlic spinach on the side. However the portion is huge, so if you split it between two it's actually pretty reasonable. For dessert we had the strawberry and pistachio gratin, which was hyped up a lot by the bar staff. The berries were too early to be flavorful so they macerated them in sugar to increase the flavor. The creamy pistachio flan was amazing though! In all, it was a meal with highs (pistachio flan in the strawberry dessert & smoked meat croquettes) and okay points. For a restaurant of it's reputation, we expected more. The ambiance is great, the staff is helpful, but if you're and english speaker you're out of luck -- the menu is in french and only written on one chalkboard. Thankfully I speak french and was able to get by, but I can see how it's hard for others.Great place, note that the menu is 100% in French.One of the single best meals I've ever had. I know it either had to be amazing or grossly overrated as we made reservations 2.5 months in advance and could only score a table at 10PM on a Thursday evening. Needless to say, I had very high expectations for Joe Beef and JB graciously blew those expectations out of the water. The whole menu is in French on a chalkboard on the wall. Luckily, I picked up some French in High School and College and was able to navigate our nosh options well enough. If French wasn't your thang in school then the waiters will give ya a hand with the translation. We also did our homework and mostly knew what we wanted. The goods: We ordered some of the house pickles along with some of their housemade sourdough with butter which were a delicious beginning to the meal. Next was the sliced ham with mushrooms. I have to say this was one of the best bites of food I have ever had the pleasure of consuming. The ham was so wonderfully soft and fresh. The mushrooms were exploding with flavor and then there was a drizzle of a light cream sauce over top. This dish was absolutely divine. Next came the Lobster Spaghetti. If you think you're too old for spaghetti, get over it and order this right now! GIant chunks of lobster + claws served in a heavy cream sauce with over spaghetti. It was so heavy, but worth every artery clogging bite!For dessert we ordered a Strawberry dish that was absolutely incredible. The Strawberries are shipped down from a farm just north of Montreal and they were so amazingly tart, tangy, and fresh. It made me feel as if I had never tasted a strawberry before and I was tasting them for the first time. Yes, sounds exaggerated but it was that good! Our waiter Patrick was absolutely wonderful! He was great on offering suggestions (we asked him to suggest the appetizer for us). He was hysterical, kind, and super quirky.   Perfect meal in the heart of Little Burgundy.Come here prepared to for meat and calorie overload!  But it is exceptionally good and the service was remarkable.  Very simply if you're traveling to the Montreal area you have to go to Joe Beef.  Oh, but plan ahead, they were booked 2 months in advance. I just got lucky with getting a last minute seat at the bar.This place is amazing.  It epitomizes everything you would want in a restaurant named Joe Beef and combines it with impeccable service, awesome attitude and a great ambiance.  Joe Beef isn't a large space (I believe there are two sides) so reservations are a must.  We had a party of 8 reserved into two groups of 4, but the hostess didn't drop a beat when we told her 2 in our party were delayed.  She seated us in an awesome table for 6 but most importantly paired us with one of the best waitresses I've ever had.  She clearly saw that we were tourists, but that's one thing that I loved about Montreal.  Many of the cool places that we went to, they welcome and are friendly to tourists and this place was no different.  It looked like it was full of French Canadians, but you couldn't tell as they effortlessly switched from English to French catering to their customer.  The menu is a revolving one and written only on the chalkboard nightly, so describing the dishes accurately is almost impossible.  Suffice it to say everything was amazing and it was easily one of the best meat-centric meals I've had in my life.  I was in heaven.  We started off with drinks and I never saw a cocktail menu but the waitress was able to order everyone drinks they loved based on just a brief description of base drink preference (ie: gin, vodka, etc.)  The drinks are strong and tasty and while perhaps not as complex as the artisinal cocktails we had at Lab just before, they were good.  I had no idea how much they cost either.  Then we started off with appetizers.  She knew we were familiar with the famous Foie Gras double down but informed us they no longer sold it.  She saw our sad faces and said would order a selection that would make us happy.  Our waitress never pushed any item (ie: their oysters are famous, but we didn't feel like any) and it really was one of the most fun and engaging ordering experiences I've had.  Foie Gras Small Bites - deep fried and filled with tiny bits of foie gras and potato.  Delicious.  This place knows meat, fried, and smoked.Mozzarella served with Toast - fresh mozzarella cheese sliced and served with toast.  A nice change and balance to all the meat.Sunnyside up Duck Eggs with Pomme Frites - I've never had eggs this good and I've sous vide many eggs. This was better.  It was super rich, seasoned perfectly and the fries were amazing.Foie Gras And Ham Sandwich - this was to make up for the double down.  Split 6 ways, we each only got a small bite, but the salty foie gras sauce and milder ham went with the decant biscuit bread with sauce.  Puff Pastry with Smoked Turkey - our waitresses favorite appetizer.  It was good but tasted a bit like turkey with small bread puffs.  Not interesting enough.Minced Duck and Seared Foie Gras - the duck looked like a steak but broke into parts of duck meat.  The seared foie gras on top was delicious and the berry sauce was a perfect contrast.  Venison Sausage - loved it.  Did I say they do meats well?Lobster Spaghetti - another famous dish.  Whole lobster with cream sauce and perfect al dente noodles.  One of my favorites of the night.  Seared Rib Eye Steak - seasoned perfectly, cooked perfectly, finished completely.Horse Meat Filet Mignon - wrapped with bacon and served with potatoes.  This was a novelty as I've never had horse meat.  Cooked perfectly medium rare the meat was delicious and a very different texture than any meat I've had.  Worth trying once.  Deep Fried Cauliflower - covered in cheese but an obligatory vegetable.Lamb Steak - yet another meat, cooked so perfectly and completely different flavor.  Duck Fat Fries - the perfect starch to complement the meat.  We were too full from drink and food for dessert but finished our meal with laughter with the staff learning French phrases, sharing the best spots for food and merriment and finishing with shots on the house.  Our bill wasn't cheap but the final price was less than I guessed.  It also was one of the best meat meals I've had in my life.  I missed Au Pied du Cochon but I don't think I would have wanted to trade away Joe Beef.  Joe Beef accepts credit cards.A pure 5 star rating without a doubt in my mind. We came to Montreal to specifically go to Joe Beef and it was certainly worth it! Rated one of the most difficult places to get a reservation, we booked many moons ahead of time. Upon arrival, we noticed all the menu items were written on a chalk board. Having poor vision, combined with dimmed lighting, I opted to go with the chefs choice for 6 courses.  It relieved us of the stress of deciding what we should share while adding a layer of anticipation and surprise.  Out waiter was terrific as he attended multiple tables with his cat shirt in celebration of National Cat Day.Favorite dishes: bone marrow, calamari stuffed with meat in a red wine mushroom sauce and apple donuts with smoked Gouda.While everything was perfectly cooked, a bit too salty on some of the more savory items.  Just a general preference of mine, but it didn't stop me from eating everything!How many times have I come to Montreal and NOT eaten here???  This place is amazing!!!  Fish of the day for two: perfectly cooked white fish in a butter wine sauce with roe mixed in, served with a side of clams and little potatoes.  Horse filet mignon (unreal), tender, cooked medium rare, it was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  Served with mashed potatoes.  Duck dish topped with a piece of foie gras.  This came with a side of vegetable but I cannot recall at this point.Even the soft serve ice cream was yummy.  A refreshing end to a most decadent meal.  Everything was fantastic.  I would come back here in an instant.  I would recommend it to everyone!I loved everything about this restaurant.  The food, the service... it was the highlight of my weekend!This place is exceptionally good!Geez- I don't know where to begin. Our table of four shared about a dozen dishes. The highlights being the Horse Tartare, a pasta with Fois Gras and deer shoulder, the smoked crispy fried trout, and the New York Strip with blue cheese.The cocktails were kinda meh.......... but the service and general experience was all on point.I would visit Joe Beef again in a heartbeat. It's one of the best dining experiences I have had.If I have a Jen K's Top 10 Restaurant List, Joe Beef would definitely be on it. And in fact, I might even able to say My Last Meal on Earth I want to have it here. (Yelp's profile question and they do serves uni!)I have been to Liverpool House, Joe Beef's sister restaurant right next door but Joe Beef is the real deal.The menu is seasonal but interesting. A mixture of seafood and meat and even vegetables. And of course foie gras!Everything we ordered were amazing. And the wait staff is just so knowledgeable with the menu and able to make awesome recommendations.The vibe is relaxing especially out on the back patio on a nice summer evening. And of these for a reasonable price! Just make sure you make a reservation ASAP, Joe Beef is just so popular and definitely worth all the hype!Joe Beef is really freakin' good.  It's been about 2 months since I've eaten there while vacationing in Montreal and I still think fondly back on it.The menu rotates pretty often - but for what it's worth - we grabbed the whole flounder with lobster bisque gravy (came with a side of mussels and lobster cream sauced veggies), slow-cooked lamb neck with sausage, seared scallops and foie gras parfait.Other than the scallops (which was fresh and perfectly cooked, but definitely hard to break the mold), everything else was exceptional.  The weirdest thing was the foie gras parfait - which was raw foie gras whipped with egg yolks and paired with tart (rather than sweet) cherries and cherry jam.  It was very strange (seriously, foie for a 'dessert' appetizer) but it worked.  It came in a big bowl so whatever we didn't have on the bread was added as a topping to everything else.  I wish the lamb neck was a bit gamier, but still excellent.  Finally, the flounder was spectacular.Service was excellent.  We were immediately seated after confirming our reservation (if you are planning a trip - do make reservations well in advance).  The service was atypical - friendly but very relaxed.  The menu board is extremely difficult for non-French speakers to read due to the dim lights.  Our waiter just told us he recommended 'everything' but was very knowledgeable, answered all our questions and gauged our appetites well as he told us to stop ordering as he was confident we had 'more than enough' food and he was right.  He really steered us to configure an optimal meal that satisfied everyone at the table considering some unique dietary restrictions.Also, the meal was surprisingly affordable.  With everything mentioned and two beers, the bill came to $65 each for the four of us - tax and tip included.Easily the best restaurant I've been to in Canada.Did not live up to the hype for me: *the smoked meat croquettes were little salt bombs and a bit one note for me.  The sliced pickles just added to the sodium.*seemed dingy inside and there were flies in the restaurant, but thought all the knick knacks strewn throughout were nice photo ops*the horse tartare is phenomenal, loved the shaved matsutakes and the brioche, heavenly.  Best red meat tartare I have ever had.  *if you must get the lobster pasta, get the half portion, it was just okay, pasta al dente, the shellfish could have been better, heavy, creamy, could have used more fresh herbs and again, a lot of the same flavor*veal, escargot and bone marrow, impressive looking dish and was more like short rib type meat than a steak-just falls apart.  Very good and very rich.  Tip: take a photo of the chalkboard and read the menu from your device.  Everyone was struggling and craning their necks.  It's been rather warm the last week, no AC at JB.  Loved our little window nook booth, but I think the garden would have been a great alternative.Reasonable pricing $160 CAD for 4 items, 2 glasses of wine, tax and tip.  We were stuffed.  Great servers and interesting meal, but my least favorite planned meal of the trip.This is my second favorite restaurant in Montreal, ranked only below it's sister restaurant, Liverpool House. Before I get into my review, first, a confession. I came here, too, because of Anthony Bordain. I am not proud of it, I wish I was a cool-kid Montreal-er, but alas I am merely a uni-lingual American.  In fact, my boyfriend and I designed a whole vacation around getting a reservation at Joe Beef. The atmosphere: Joe Beef is simultaneously sexy and casual. It has dark mood lighting, but hockey memorabilia decor. They play Neil Young and French singers I do not recognize. Your plates and glasses are mismatched, and appear to come from a cool thrift store. The bar is boisterous-  ladies cackling, men singing, loud debates amounting, etc. ( an example from our dinner: whether Americans are bigger prudes than Canadians). The staff are irreverent and knowledgeable. Almost all of them seem to have a gleam of mischievous in their eyes. The Food: I ordered some sort of lamb sausage plate, the cocktail of the day (x3), and PEI oysters. My other half ordered the pheasant and wine. We were both very happy. If I had to describe the food, I'd say it was decedent,and intense. My lamb dish was so huge, it presented like a dare. It wasn't prepared like your usual lamb, in that it was not Mediterranean inspired. It actually reminded me a lot of the food I ate in Prague - made to keep you full and warm. It had a dark aroma - of spices I did not recognize but enjoyed. The Oysters were meaty and briny, and served with a very spicy homemade hot sauce. The star of our night was desert, Marjolaine (a painstaking, many-layered chocolate and hazelnut cake). It was the best desert I've ever had in my life. For those Anthony Bordain fans morjolaine was featured in the No Reservations, Quebec episode. There is also a recipe for it in Joe Beef's cookbook. Anyways, making a pilgrimage to Joe Beef should definitely be on any foodie's vacation itinerary. The food, atmosphere, and service were wonderful. I felt right at home in my comfy booth, tearing through animal parts and slogging beer.Food 5 / 5 decor 5 / 5 service 5 / 5 We were 4, made reservations 2 months prior. Everything about the experience was perfection, one of the best part of joe beef is that you get top notch quality without the snootiness. You can get there in a suit, or in sweats, it won't matter because everyone is there for one reason: hearty, meaty, and delicious cuisine du terroir. The staff knows the food inside out as if they've cooked everything themselves.1. Smoked trout 26$2. Duck terrine 17$3. Large pulled pork with butternut squash gnocchis (regular 27$ large 40.50$) 4. Roasted Fowl 66$5. Side of bone marrow 16$6. Order of fries with parmesan flakes 8$7. Pear pie with housemade Pear and clove ice cream 16$+ 2 bottles of wine (white 65$ and red 65$)+ 3 coffees (3$ each)Everything above was shared. With tax and a 15% tip our total was 435$. For me, the pulled pork stole the show,  it's as if the meat just melted in your mouth, it was so tender. And the ice cream I would buy by the gallon if I could.It's been a while since I wrote a review but I've been busy enjoying life.  Anyways, here goes a review of a highly recommended restaurant I went in Montreal earlier this month.  I came with a friend I haven't seen since college so needless to say, there was a lot we had to catch up on.The setting is quite intimate but it didn't hinder a good conversation.  What we didn't like was the menu.  It is a blackboard hung up high in the wall and written in French only.  The handwriting was like a doctor's prescription and the blackboard was not properly erased so it made reading the menu immensely difficult (not to mention I didn't bring my glasses or read French).I thought the service was ok.  My friend thought our server was a little pretentious.  Anyhow, at least they offered to sell me a half portion of their famous lobster spaghetti.  That allowed me to enjoy some oysters and Canadian sea urchin (uni) as appetizer.  It would be too much food otherwise.  Taste-wise, everything was on par and predictable.It is a pricey place so do save it for a special occasion.  Reservation necessary.As I watched our cheerful server patiently (and entertainingly) translate the French-language menu in its entirety, I was at first dubious, then astonished, and finally delighted.  It was a glimpse into the workings of an establishment of humble origins that has gained acclaim as one of Canada's premier restaurants.The service here is genuinely welcoming.  I am reminded of the graciousness that defines hospitality at a Danny Meyer restaurant.  Without hovering, our servers were there when needed.  From a fine wine list dominated by bottles in the triple digits, our server swiftly ascertained our preference for a lower end choice, then narrowed down a flavor profile in just a brief, bantering exchange.  It was near worth ordering a second bottle for.An argument can be made for two bottles.  Although renowned as a meat-centric restaurant, Joe Beef is equally at ease with seafood, so a sampling of both is reasonable.  One of their more impressive starters were two whole, small trout showered with seasonally fresh vegetables.  The tender meat is gently smoked, yielding a flavor that is surprisingly restrained: enough to accent, not enough to dominate.  Shellfish shined in an equally wonderful sausage of lobster and clams; plump, juicy, and brimming with the flavors of its ingredients.  If the starter menu isn't enough, a few quality, local raw bar options are offered.  Raw oysters are de rigueur, but more interesting was a fresh uni prepared in a light tomato sauce and served in its shell, or the sweet snow crab legs.Of course, it would be sinful to eschew meat at Joe Beef, which offers up a few sharable beef entrees, along with foie gras, Canadian smoked meat, duck, rabbit, horse, lamb, and chicken dishes.  Foie gras parfait is flawless; creamy and luxurious, perfectly offset by a bite of crisp, sharp radish on warm, crusty brioche.  The same brioche is molded like a nest around smooth horse tartare, although robust seasoning muffled the sweetness of raw horse.  Simple, expertly cooked duck breast was a marvel of flavor and succulence.It is easy to see how this utterly charming restaurant is as famed as it is.  It is not for a specific dish, gimmick, or personality.  With its constantly changing menu penned only on chalkboard, Joe Beef announces its allegiance to local, seasonal foods, and prepares them exceptionally well.  Add to that the warmth of the staff and a uniquely home-like atmosphere between its cozy, tavern-like space inside and a festive outdoor area reminiscent of a patio.  It makes for a highly enjoyable, low-key dining experience that seems effortless in execution yet must surely be anything but.  And it will have one thinking about a return visit as soon as possible.I LOVED our waitress!

The lamb sausage was a tad too salty in my opinion and could have used more starch or veggie on the side to balance that out. The strip steak was flavourful but a little more tough than expected. The fries were cute in a mini Creuset but pretty standard in terms of taste. Cons: 1. Menu is only in French and on the blackboard. Being fully bilingual, I didn't mind at all that the menu was in French. More importantly, I just don't think it is practical to have the only version of the menu on the single blackboard that half the restaurant has their back up against. The ONLY thing that partially made up for it was the detail-oriented servers who could cater to individual questions. It just seemed like a bit of a drag for the server to repeat the menu so many times. 2. In terms of value, sad to say that Joe Beef didn't live up to the hype this time. I'm all about paying good money for dinner but we both agreed that the meal just didn't live up to the long wait for reservations and the price.To try next time: - Lobster spaghetti - Rib steak for 2Lives up to the hype. Other than my appetizer being a little over seasoned (fresh pasta with venison), I only have good things to say. Our waitress did an excellent job guiding us through a somewhat cryptic menu on the chalk board and the end result was a memorable three course dinner. The next time a friend from out of town asks me where they should eat when they come to Montreal, I'll probably tell them to go to Joe Beef.Oh my God, Yumm!My Buddy had been frothing at the mouth to come up to Montreal and try this spot. Wouldn't stop talking about it, ha ha.So we did.We started with the Horse Tar Tar, and tell you the truth, with enough of it, that could have been my meal, it was soooooo goooooood!He had the steak, I had the lamb.  The lamb was good, not great.  His steak was to die for. For sure I will be back and have the steak.Tip: the servers in Canada are quite honest about what's good and tasty on the menu, so if they suggest anything, go for it! We almost balked at the horse tar tar, and it ended up being other-wordly!A good restaurant, but not a great one at the time of my visit.We were able to squeeze in a reservation for two at the bar, and were very excited given all the hype this restaurant has. But it just didn't meet those expectations for me. We each had a glass of wine, then followed with the local buffalo mozzarella appetizer which came with 2 slivers of fish and 2 slices of rye toast. The cheese was lovely, but nothing to write home about; it's fresh mozzarella? Next we had the smoked meat croquettes which were really good, easily the highlight of the meal -- it's everything you love about smoked meat squished up into a little tater-tot sized bite with a pickle on top. For entrees, we split the gentleman's steak with bleu cheese and while it was extremely well cooked (rare) it was really pricey for what amounted to a properly cooked steak with a scoop of garlic spinach on the side. However the portion is huge, so if you split it between two it's actually pretty reasonable. For dessert we had the strawberry and pistachio gratin, which was hyped up a lot by the bar staff. The berries were too early to be flavorful so they macerated them in sugar to increase the flavor. The creamy pistachio flan was amazing though! In all, it was a meal with highs (pistachio flan in the strawberry dessert & smoked meat croquettes) and okay points. For a restaurant of it's reputation, we expected more. The ambiance is great, the staff is helpful, but if you're and english speaker you're out of luck -- the menu is in french and only written on one chalkboard. Thankfully I speak french and was able to get by, but I can see how it's hard for others.Great place, note that the menu is 100% in French.One of the single best meals I've ever had. I know it either had to be amazing or grossly overrated as we made reservations 2.5 months in advance and could only score a table at 10PM on a Thursday evening. Needless to say, I had very high expectations for Joe Beef and JB graciously blew those expectations out of the water. The whole menu is in French on a chalkboard on the wall. Luckily, I picked up some French in High School and College and was able to navigate our nosh options well enough. If French wasn't your thang in school then the waiters will give ya a hand with the translation. We also did our homework and mostly knew what we wanted. The goods: We ordered some of the house pickles along with some of their housemade sourdough with butter which were a delicious beginning to the meal. Next was the sliced ham with mushrooms. I have to say this was one of the best bites of food I have ever had the pleasure of consuming. The ham was so wonderfully soft and fresh. The mushrooms were exploding with flavor and then there was a drizzle of a light cream sauce over top. This dish was absolutely divine. Next came the Lobster Spaghetti. If you think you're too old for spaghetti, get over it and order this right now! GIant chunks of lobster + claws served in a heavy cream sauce with over spaghetti. It was so heavy, but worth every artery clogging bite!For dessert we ordered a Strawberry dish that was absolutely incredible. The Strawberries are shipped down from a farm just north of Montreal and they were so amazingly tart, tangy, and fresh. It made me feel as if I had never tasted a strawberry before and I was tasting them for the first time. Yes, sounds exaggerated but it was that good! Our waiter Patrick was absolutely wonderful! He was great on offering suggestions (we asked him to suggest the appetizer for us). He was hysterical, kind, and super quirky.   Perfect meal in the heart of Little Burgundy.Come here prepared to for meat and calorie overload!  But it is exceptionally good and the service was remarkable.  Very simply if you're traveling to the Montreal area you have to go to Joe Beef.  Oh, but plan ahead, they were booked 2 months in advance. I just got lucky with getting a last minute seat at the bar.This place is amazing.  It epitomizes everything you would want in a restaurant named Joe Beef and combines it with impeccable service, awesome attitude and a great ambiance.  Joe Beef isn't a large space (I believe there are two sides) so reservations are a must.  We had a party of 8 reserved into two groups of 4, but the hostess didn't drop a beat when we told her 2 in our party were delayed.  She seated us in an awesome table for 6 but most importantly paired us with one of the best waitresses I've ever had.  She clearly saw that we were tourists, but that's one thing that I loved about Montreal.  Many of the cool places that we went to, they welcome and are friendly to tourists and this place was no different.  It looked like it was full of French Canadians, but you couldn't tell as they effortlessly switched from English to French catering to their customer.  The menu is a revolving one and written only on the chalkboard nightly, so describing the dishes accurately is almost impossible.  Suffice it to say everything was amazing and it was easily one of the best meat-centric meals I've had in my life.  I was in heaven.  We started off with drinks and I never saw a cocktail menu but the waitress was able to order everyone drinks they loved based on just a brief description of base drink preference (ie: gin, vodka, etc.)  The drinks are strong and tasty and while perhaps not as complex as the artisinal cocktails we had at Lab just before, they were good.  I had no idea how much they cost either.  Then we started off with appetizers.  She knew we were familiar with the famous Foie Gras double down but informed us they no longer sold it.  She saw our sad faces and said would order a selection that would make us happy.  Our waitress never pushed any item (ie: their oysters are famous, but we didn't feel like any) and it really was one of the most fun and engaging ordering experiences I've had.  Foie Gras Small Bites - deep fried and filled with tiny bits of foie gras and potato.  Delicious.  This place knows meat, fried, and smoked.Mozzarella served with Toast - fresh mozzarella cheese sliced and served with toast.  A nice change and balance to all the meat.Sunnyside up Duck Eggs with Pomme Frites - I've never had eggs this good and I've sous vide many eggs. This was better.  It was super rich, seasoned perfectly and the fries were amazing.Foie Gras And Ham Sandwich - this was to make up for the double down.  Split 6 ways, we each only got a small bite, but the salty foie gras sauce and milder ham went with the decant biscuit bread with sauce.  Puff Pastry with Smoked Turkey - our waitresses favorite appetizer.  It was good but tasted a bit like turkey with small bread puffs.  Not interesting enough.Minced Duck and Seared Foie Gras - the duck looked like a steak but broke into parts of duck meat.  The seared foie gras on top was delicious and the berry sauce was a perfect contrast.  Venison Sausage - loved it.  Did I say they do meats well?Lobster Spaghetti - another famous dish.  Whole lobster with cream sauce and perfect al dente noodles.  One of my favorites of the night.  Seared Rib Eye Steak - seasoned perfectly, cooked perfectly, finished completely.Horse Meat Filet Mignon - wrapped with bacon and served with potatoes.  This was a novelty as I've never had horse meat.  Cooked perfectly medium rare the meat was delicious and a very different texture than any meat I've had.  Worth trying once.  Deep Fried Cauliflower - covered in cheese but an obligatory vegetable.Lamb Steak - yet another meat, cooked so perfectly and completely different flavor.  Duck Fat Fries - the perfect starch to complement the meat.  We were too full from drink and food for dessert but finished our meal with laughter with the staff learning French phrases, sharing the best spots for food and merriment and finishing with shots on the house.  Our bill wasn't cheap but the final price was less than I guessed.  It also was one of the best meat meals I've had in my life.  I missed Au Pied du Cochon but I don't think I would have wanted to trade away Joe Beef.  Joe Beef accepts credit cards.A pure 5 star rating without a doubt in my mind. We came to Montreal to specifically go to Joe Beef and it was certainly worth it! Rated one of the most difficult places to get a reservation, we booked many moons ahead of time. Upon arrival, we noticed all the menu items were written on a chalk board. Having poor vision, combined with dimmed lighting, I opted to go with the chefs choice for 6 courses.  It relieved us of the stress of deciding what we should share while adding a layer of anticipation and surprise.  Out waiter was terrific as he attended multiple tables with his cat shirt in celebration of National Cat Day.Favorite dishes: bone marrow, calamari stuffed with meat in a red wine mushroom sauce and apple donuts with smoked Gouda.While everything was perfectly cooked, a bit too salty on some of the more savory items.  Just a general preference of mine, but it didn't stop me from eating everything!How many times have I come to Montreal and NOT eaten here???  This place is amazing!!!  Fish of the day for two: perfectly cooked white fish in a butter wine sauce with roe mixed in, served with a side of clams and little potatoes.  Horse filet mignon (unreal), tender, cooked medium rare, it was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  Served with mashed potatoes.  Duck dish topped with a piece of foie gras.  This came with a side of vegetable but I cannot recall at this point.Even the soft serve ice cream was yummy.  A refreshing end to a most decadent meal.  Everything was fantastic.  I would come back here in an instant.  I would recommend it to everyone!I loved everything about this restaurant.  The food, the service... it was the highlight of my weekend!This place is exceptionally good!Geez- I don't know where to begin. Our table of four shared about a dozen dishes. The highlights being the Horse Tartare, a pasta with Fois Gras and deer shoulder, the smoked crispy fried trout, and the New York Strip with blue cheese.The cocktails were kinda meh.......... but the service and general experience was all on point.I would visit Joe Beef again in a heartbeat. It's one of the best dining experiences I have had.If I have a Jen K's Top 10 Restaurant List, Joe Beef would definitely be on it. And in fact, I might even able to say My Last Meal on Earth I want to have it here. (Yelp's profile question and they do serves uni!)I have been to Liverpool House, Joe Beef's sister restaurant right next door but Joe Beef is the real deal.The menu is seasonal but interesting. A mixture of seafood and meat and even vegetables. And of course foie gras!Everything we ordered were amazing. And the wait staff is just so knowledgeable with the menu and able to make awesome recommendations.The vibe is relaxing especially out on the back patio on a nice summer evening. And of these for a reasonable price! Just make sure you make a reservation ASAP, Joe Beef is just so popular and definitely worth all the hype!Joe Beef is really freakin' good.  It's been about 2 months since I've eaten there while vacationing in Montreal and I still think fondly back on it.The menu rotates pretty often - but for what it's worth - we grabbed the whole flounder with lobster bisque gravy (came with a side of mussels and lobster cream sauced veggies), slow-cooked lamb neck with sausage, seared scallops and foie gras parfait.Other than the scallops (which was fresh and perfectly cooked, but definitely hard to break the mold), everything else was exceptional.  The weirdest thing was the foie gras parfait - which was raw foie gras whipped with egg yolks and paired with tart (rather than sweet) cherries and cherry jam.  It was very strange (seriously, foie for a 'dessert' appetizer) but it worked.  It came in a big bowl so whatever we didn't have on the bread was added as a topping to everything else.  I wish the lamb neck was a bit gamier, but still excellent.  Finally, the flounder was spectacular.Service was excellent.  We were immediately seated after confirming our reservation (if you are planning a trip - do make reservations well in advance).  The service was atypical - friendly but very relaxed.  The menu board is extremely difficult for non-French speakers to read due to the dim lights.  Our waiter just told us he recommended 'everything' but was very knowledgeable, answered all our questions and gauged our appetites well as he told us to stop ordering as he was confident we had 'more than enough' food and he was right.  He really steered us to configure an optimal meal that satisfied everyone at the table considering some unique dietary restrictions.Also, the meal was surprisingly affordable.  With everything mentioned and two beers, the bill came to $65 each for the four of us - tax and tip included.Easily the best restaurant I've been to in Canada.Did not live up to the hype for me: *the smoked meat croquettes were little salt bombs and a bit one note for me.  The sliced pickles just added to the sodium.*seemed dingy inside and there were flies in the restaurant, but thought all the knick knacks strewn throughout were nice photo ops*the horse tartare is phenomenal, loved the shaved matsutakes and the brioche, heavenly.  Best red meat tartare I have ever had.  *if you must get the lobster pasta, get the half portion, it was just okay, pasta al dente, the shellfish could have been better, heavy, creamy, could have used more fresh herbs and again, a lot of the same flavor*veal, escargot and bone marrow, impressive looking dish and was more like short rib type meat than a steak-just falls apart.  Very good and very rich.  Tip: take a photo of the chalkboard and read the menu from your device.  Everyone was struggling and craning their necks.  It's been rather warm the last week, no AC at JB.  Loved our little window nook booth, but I think the garden would have been a great alternative.Reasonable pricing $160 CAD for 4 items, 2 glasses of wine, tax and tip.  We were stuffed.  Great servers and interesting meal, but my least favorite planned meal of the trip.This is my second favorite restaurant in Montreal, ranked only below it's sister restaurant, Liverpool House. Before I get into my review, first, a confession. I came here, too, because of Anthony Bordain. I am not proud of it, I wish I was a cool-kid Montreal-er, but alas I am merely a uni-lingual American.  In fact, my boyfriend and I designed a whole vacation around getting a reservation at Joe Beef. The atmosphere: Joe Beef is simultaneously sexy and casual. It has dark mood lighting, but hockey memorabilia decor. They play Neil Young and French singers I do not recognize. Your plates and glasses are mismatched, and appear to come from a cool thrift store. The bar is boisterous-  ladies cackling, men singing, loud debates amounting, etc. ( an example from our dinner: whether Americans are bigger prudes than Canadians). The staff are irreverent and knowledgeable. Almost all of them seem to have a gleam of mischievous in their eyes. The Food: I ordered some sort of lamb sausage plate, the cocktail of the day (x3), and PEI oysters. My other half ordered the pheasant and wine. We were both very happy. If I had to describe the food, I'd say it was decedent,and intense. My lamb dish was so huge, it presented like a dare. It wasn't prepared like your usual lamb, in that it was not Mediterranean inspired. It actually reminded me a lot of the food I ate in Prague - made to keep you full and warm. It had a dark aroma - of spices I did not recognize but enjoyed. The Oysters were meaty and briny, and served with a very spicy homemade hot sauce. The star of our night was desert, Marjolaine (a painstaking, many-layered chocolate and hazelnut cake). It was the best desert I've ever had in my life. For those Anthony Bordain fans morjolaine was featured in the No Reservations, Quebec episode. There is also a recipe for it in Joe Beef's cookbook. Anyways, making a pilgrimage to Joe Beef should definitely be on any foodie's vacation itinerary. The food, atmosphere, and service were wonderful. I felt right at home in my comfy booth, tearing through animal parts and slogging beer.Food 5 / 5 decor 5 / 5 service 5 / 5 We were 4, made reservations 2 months prior. Everything about the experience was perfection, one of the best part of joe beef is that you get top notch quality without the snootiness. You can get there in a suit, or in sweats, it won't matter because everyone is there for one reason: hearty, meaty, and delicious cuisine du terroir. The staff knows the food inside out as if they've cooked everything themselves.1. Smoked trout 26$2. Duck terrine 17$3. Large pulled pork with butternut squash gnocchis (regular 27$ large 40.50$) 4. Roasted Fowl 66$5. Side of bone marrow 16$6. Order of fries with parmesan flakes 8$7. Pear pie with housemade Pear and clove ice cream 16$+ 2 bottles of wine (white 65$ and red 65$)+ 3 coffees (3$ each)Everything above was shared. With tax and a 15% tip our total was 435$. For me, the pulled pork stole the show,  it's as if the meat just melted in your mouth, it was so tender. And the ice cream I would buy by the gallon if I could.It's been a while since I wrote a review but I've been busy enjoying life.  Anyways, here goes a review of a highly recommended restaurant I went in Montreal earlier this month.  I came with a friend I haven't seen since college so needless to say, there was a lot we had to catch up on.The setting is quite intimate but it didn't hinder a good conversation.  What we didn't like was the menu.  It is a blackboard hung up high in the wall and written in French only.  The handwriting was like a doctor's prescription and the blackboard was not properly erased so it made reading the menu immensely difficult (not to mention I didn't bring my glasses or read French).I thought the service was ok.  My friend thought our server was a little pretentious.  Anyhow, at least they offered to sell me a half portion of their famous lobster spaghetti.  That allowed me to enjoy some oysters and Canadian sea urchin (uni) as appetizer.  It would be too much food otherwise.  Taste-wise, everything was on par and predictable.It is a pricey place so do save it for a special occasion.  Reservation necessary.As I watched our cheerful server patiently (and entertainingly) translate the French-language menu in its entirety, I was at first dubious, then astonished, and finally delighted.  It was a glimpse into the workings of an establishment of humble origins that has gained acclaim as one of Canada's premier restaurants.The service here is genuinely welcoming.  I am reminded of the graciousness that defines hospitality at a Danny Meyer restaurant.  Without hovering, our servers were there when needed.  From a fine wine list dominated by bottles in the triple digits, our server swiftly ascertained our preference for a lower end choice, then narrowed down a flavor profile in just a brief, bantering exchange.  It was near worth ordering a second bottle for.An argument can be made for two bottles.  Although renowned as a meat-centric restaurant, Joe Beef is equally at ease with seafood, so a sampling of both is reasonable.  One of their more impressive starters were two whole, small trout showered with seasonally fresh vegetables.  The tender meat is gently smoked, yielding a flavor that is surprisingly restrained: enough to accent, not enough to dominate.  Shellfish shined in an equally wonderful sausage of lobster and clams; plump, juicy, and brimming with the flavors of its ingredients.  If the starter menu isn't enough, a few quality, local raw bar options are offered.  Raw oysters are de rigueur, but more interesting was a fresh uni prepared in a light tomato sauce and served in its shell, or the sweet snow crab legs.Of course, it would be sinful to eschew meat at Joe Beef, which offers up a few sharable beef entrees, along with foie gras, Canadian smoked meat, duck, rabbit, horse, lamb, and chicken dishes.  Foie gras parfait is flawless; creamy and luxurious, perfectly offset by a bite of crisp, sharp radish on warm, crusty brioche.  The same brioche is molded like a nest around smooth horse tartare, although robust seasoning muffled the sweetness of raw horse.  Simple, expertly cooked duck breast was a marvel of flavor and succulence.It is easy to see how this utterly charming restaurant is as famed as it is.  It is not for a specific dish, gimmick, or personality.  With its constantly changing menu penned only on chalkboard, Joe Beef announces its allegiance to local, seasonal foods, and prepares them exceptionally well.  Add to that the warmth of the staff and a uniquely home-like atmosphere between its cozy, tavern-like space inside and a festive outdoor area reminiscent of a patio.  It makes for a highly enjoyable, low-key dining experience that seems effortless in execution yet must surely be anything but.  And it will have one thinking about a return visit as soon as possible.I LOVED our waitress! She was so friendly and down-to-earth. - I made my reservations 3 months in advance (that's the earliest you can make it) - It's a dimly-lit, tiny restaurant, very homey and intimate - They played some great music while we were there (biggie smalls and some frenchy music)- The menu is written on the chalkboard (behind people sitting in the restaurant) - just take a picture with your smart phone and look at the menu from your seat instead of cranking your neck around and struggling to read it - The waitress encourages you to get up from your seat to look at the menu and she can answer any questions or give you recommendations - Duck for 2 ($90) is HUGE and worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It comes with 2 pieces of foie gras and a duck leg (confit), and like a whole freakin duck. It was SO good. We couldn't finish and I was really sad. HUGE portions. - Corn chowder was delicious too - For dessert, I picked ice cream with concord grapes - it was very good. - I also got to pick at my neighbor's cake (we became friends after sitting so close for 2 hours) - 12 layers of buttercream As with any other French restaurants in Montreal, your meal will probably last 2 hours or longer.We were able to get a last minute reservation here the day of for 9ish. We thought we had lucked out. In some ways we did, in some ways we didn't.  It was a great meal but it was crazy expensive. I was under the impression that this place was small but it has expanded to a full rowhouse so capacity was not a problem. Couples shuffled in and out and there were 1 or 2 empty tables near us the entire time. It was kind of cramped as we were crammed in there. We were seated at a 2 top between 2 couples in the back. Our server was lovely and gave us great choices. It was so dark in there and the writing on the board is so narrow and squiggly there is no way you can see the board so you are completely at the server's mercy when it comes to food and wine choices. The choices she gave us was excellent tho but the prices were tremendously inflated. We got a CAD $110 bottle of wine which I found out on the internet was really a USD $38 bottle of wine so I guess it was the standard markup. We had a Great froie gras appetizer and I had the blue cheese rabbit while hubby had a steak that came overcooked. The server asked him about it and he said it was ok but she took the liberty of sending it back and giving him a rare one instead. I didn't know this at the time but for the prices we were about to pay, it was par for the course. His new steak took a while to come. So 2 bottles of wine, 1 appetizer and 2 main courses, 1 salad and a fruit dessert set us back  400 CAD.  It was about 14 CAD for a side salad add on and similar for a berries dessert with cream. They did give us a small complimentary tasting of another wine for the steak mishap. So...it was good but I'm not sure if it was $400 good. I LOVE French Canadian food and have eaten my way through Quebec City on two occasions not having paid nearly as much in a couple of days than what we did tonight. To make myself feel better, I just looked up the exchange rate so the meal was about 300 USD which sits a lot better in my stomach. Still, Joe Beef is kind of overrated but I'm glad we did it. If we were to come back, I'd definitely only have 1 bottle of wine, and skip the expensive extras like dessert and salad.After an anxious six week wait, the night finally came for dinner at Joe Beef! Pros:1. Service is impeccable. All of the staff is very knowledgeable, in-tune with the menu and attentive to allergies. They checked back at just the right frequency. No complaints at all here. 2. Food is definitely above average. Snow crab legs were incredible -- As our server said, they are in season right now so they were very sweet and didn't even need condiments. The lamb sausage was a tad too salty in my opinion and could have used more starch or veggie on the side to balance that out. The strip steak was flavourful but a little more tough than expected. The fries were cute in a mini Creuset but pretty standard in terms of taste. Cons: 1. Menu is only in French and on the blackboard. Being fully bilingual, I didn't mind at all that the menu was in French. More importantly, I just don't think it is practical to have the only version of the menu on the single blackboard that half the restaurant has their back up against. The ONLY thing that partially made up for it was the detail-oriented servers who could cater to individual questions. It just seemed like a bit of a drag for the server to repeat the menu so many times. 2. In terms of value, sad to say that Joe Beef didn't live up to the hype this time. I'm all about paying good money for dinner but we both agreed that the meal just didn't live up to the long wait for reservations and the price.To try next time: - Lobster spaghetti - Rib steak for 2Lives up to the hype.

I just got lucky with getting a last minute seat at the bar.This place is amazing.  It epitomizes everything you would want in a restaurant named Joe Beef and combines it with impeccable service, awesome attitude and a great ambiance.  Joe Beef isn't a large space (I believe there are two sides) so reservations are a must.  We had a party of 8 reserved into two groups of 4, but the hostess didn't drop a beat when we told her 2 in our party were delayed.  She seated us in an awesome table for 6 but most importantly paired us with one of the best waitresses I've ever had.  She clearly saw that we were tourists, but that's one thing that I loved about Montreal.  Many of the cool places that we went to, they welcome and are friendly to tourists and this place was no different.  It looked like it was full of French Canadians, but you couldn't tell as they effortlessly switched from English to French catering to their customer.  The menu is a revolving one and written only on the chalkboard nightly, so describing the dishes accurately is almost impossible.  Suffice it to say everything was amazing and it was easily one of the best meat-centric meals I've had in my life.  I was in heaven.  We started off with drinks and I never saw a cocktail menu but the waitress was able to order everyone drinks they loved based on just a brief description of base drink preference (ie: gin, vodka, etc.)  The drinks are strong and tasty and while perhaps not as complex as the artisinal cocktails we had at Lab just before, they were good.  I had no idea how much they cost either.  Then we started off with appetizers.  She knew we were familiar with the famous Foie Gras double down but informed us they no longer sold it.  She saw our sad faces and said would order a selection that would make us happy.  Our waitress never pushed any item (ie: their oysters are famous, but we didn't feel like any) and it really was one of the most fun and engaging ordering experiences I've had.  Foie Gras Small Bites - deep fried and filled with tiny bits of foie gras and potato.  Delicious.  This place knows meat, fried, and smoked.Mozzarella served with Toast - fresh mozzarella cheese sliced and served with toast.  A nice change and balance to all the meat.Sunnyside up Duck Eggs with Pomme Frites - I've never had eggs this good and I've sous vide many eggs. This was better.  It was super rich, seasoned perfectly and the fries were amazing.Foie Gras And Ham Sandwich - this was to make up for the double down.  Split 6 ways, we each only got a small bite, but the salty foie gras sauce and milder ham went with the decant biscuit bread with sauce.  Puff Pastry with Smoked Turkey - our waitresses favorite appetizer.  It was good but tasted a bit like turkey with small bread puffs.  Not interesting enough.Minced Duck and Seared Foie Gras - the duck looked like a steak but broke into parts of duck meat.  The seared foie gras on top was delicious and the berry sauce was a perfect contrast.  Venison Sausage - loved it.  Did I say they do meats well?Lobster Spaghetti - another famous dish.  Whole lobster with cream sauce and perfect al dente noodles.  One of my favorites of the night.  Seared Rib Eye Steak - seasoned perfectly, cooked perfectly, finished completely.Horse Meat Filet Mignon - wrapped with bacon and served with potatoes.  This was a novelty as I've never had horse meat.  Cooked perfectly medium rare the meat was delicious and a very different texture than any meat I've had.  Worth trying once.  Deep Fried Cauliflower - covered in cheese but an obligatory vegetable.Lamb Steak - yet another meat, cooked so perfectly and completely different flavor.  Duck Fat Fries - the perfect starch to complement the meat.  We were too full from drink and food for dessert but finished our meal with laughter with the staff learning French phrases, sharing the best spots for food and merriment and finishing with shots on the house.  Our bill wasn't cheap but the final price was less than I guessed.  It also was one of the best meat meals I've had in my life.  I missed Au Pied du Cochon but I don't think I would have wanted to trade away Joe Beef.  Joe Beef accepts credit cards.A pure 5 star rating without a doubt in my mind. We came to Montreal to specifically go to Joe Beef and it was certainly worth it! Rated one of the most difficult places to get a reservation, we booked many moons ahead of time. Upon arrival, we noticed all the menu items were written on a chalk board. Having poor vision, combined with dimmed lighting, I opted to go with the chefs choice for 6 courses.  It relieved us of the stress of deciding what we should share while adding a layer of anticipation and surprise.  Out waiter was terrific as he attended multiple tables with his cat shirt in celebration of National Cat Day.Favorite dishes: bone marrow, calamari stuffed with meat in a red wine mushroom sauce and apple donuts with smoked Gouda.While everything was perfectly cooked, a bit too salty on some of the more savory items.  Just a general preference of mine, but it didn't stop me from eating everything!How many times have I come to Montreal and NOT eaten here???  This place is amazing!!!  Fish of the day for two: perfectly cooked white fish in a butter wine sauce with roe mixed in, served with a side of clams and little potatoes.  Horse filet mignon (unreal), tender, cooked medium rare, it was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  Served with mashed potatoes.  Duck dish topped with a piece of foie gras.  This came with a side of vegetable but I cannot recall at this point.Even the soft serve ice cream was yummy.  A refreshing end to a most decadent meal.  Everything was fantastic.  I would come back here in an instant.  I would recommend it to everyone!I loved everything about this restaurant.  The food, the service... it was the highlight of my weekend!This place is exceptionally good!Geez- I don't know where to begin. Our table of four shared about a dozen dishes. The highlights being the Horse Tartare, a pasta with Fois Gras and deer shoulder, the smoked crispy fried trout, and the New York Strip with blue cheese.The cocktails were kinda meh.......... but the service and general experience was all on point.I would visit Joe Beef again in a heartbeat. It's one of the best dining experiences I have had.If I have a Jen K's Top 10 Restaurant List, Joe Beef would definitely be on it. And in fact, I might even able to say My Last Meal on Earth I want to have it here. (Yelp's profile question and they do serves uni!)I have been to Liverpool House, Joe Beef's sister restaurant right next door but Joe Beef is the real deal.The menu is seasonal but interesting. A mixture of seafood and meat and even vegetables. And of course foie gras!Everything we ordered were amazing. And the wait staff is just so knowledgeable with the menu and able to make awesome recommendations.The vibe is relaxing especially out on the back patio on a nice summer evening. And of these for a reasonable price! Just make sure you make a reservation ASAP, Joe Beef is just so popular and definitely worth all the hype!Joe Beef is really freakin' good.  It's been about 2 months since I've eaten there while vacationing in Montreal and I still think fondly back on it.The menu rotates pretty often - but for what it's worth - we grabbed the whole flounder with lobster bisque gravy (came with a side of mussels and lobster cream sauced veggies), slow-cooked lamb neck with sausage, seared scallops and foie gras parfait.Other than the scallops (which was fresh and perfectly cooked, but definitely hard to break the mold), everything else was exceptional.  The weirdest thing was the foie gras parfait - which was raw foie gras whipped with egg yolks and paired with tart (rather than sweet) cherries and cherry jam.  It was very strange (seriously, foie for a 'dessert' appetizer) but it worked.  It came in a big bowl so whatever we didn't have on the bread was added as a topping to everything else.  I wish the lamb neck was a bit gamier, but still excellent.  Finally, the flounder was spectacular.Service was excellent.  We were immediately seated after confirming our reservation (if you are planning a trip - do make reservations well in advance).  The service was atypical - friendly but very relaxed.  The menu board is extremely difficult for non-French speakers to read due to the dim lights.  Our waiter just told us he recommended 'everything' but was very knowledgeable, answered all our questions and gauged our appetites well as he told us to stop ordering as he was confident we had 'more than enough' food and he was right.  He really steered us to configure an optimal meal that satisfied everyone at the table considering some unique dietary restrictions.Also, the meal was surprisingly affordable.  With everything mentioned and two beers, the bill came to $65 each for the four of us - tax and tip included.Easily the best restaurant I've been to in Canada.Did not live up to the hype for me: *the smoked meat croquettes were little salt bombs and a bit one note for me.  The sliced pickles just added to the sodium.*seemed dingy inside and there were flies in the restaurant, but thought all the knick knacks strewn throughout were nice photo ops*the horse tartare is phenomenal, loved the shaved matsutakes and the brioche, heavenly.  Best red meat tartare I have ever had.  *if you must get the lobster pasta, get the half portion, it was just okay, pasta al dente, the shellfish could have been better, heavy, creamy, could have used more fresh herbs and again, a lot of the same flavor*veal, escargot and bone marrow, impressive looking dish and was more like short rib type meat than a steak-just falls apart.  Very good and very rich.  Tip: take a photo of the chalkboard and read the menu from your device.  Everyone was struggling and craning their necks.  It's been rather warm the last week, no AC at JB.  Loved our little window nook booth, but I think the garden would have been a great alternative.Reasonable pricing $160 CAD for 4 items, 2 glasses of wine, tax and tip.  We were stuffed.  Great servers and interesting meal, but my least favorite planned meal of the trip.This is my second favorite restaurant in Montreal, ranked only below it's sister restaurant, Liverpool House. Before I get into my review, first, a confession. I came here, too, because of Anthony Bordain. I am not proud of it, I wish I was a cool-kid Montreal-er, but alas I am merely a uni-lingual American.  In fact, my boyfriend and I designed a whole vacation around getting a reservation at Joe Beef. The atmosphere: Joe Beef is simultaneously sexy and casual. It has dark mood lighting, but hockey memorabilia decor. They play Neil Young and French singers I do not recognize. Your plates and glasses are mismatched, and appear to come from a cool thrift store. The bar is boisterous-  ladies cackling, men singing, loud debates amounting, etc. ( an example from our dinner: whether Americans are bigger prudes than Canadians). The staff are irreverent and knowledgeable. Almost all of them seem to have a gleam of mischievous in their eyes. The Food: I ordered some sort of lamb sausage plate, the cocktail of the day (x3), and PEI oysters. My other half ordered the pheasant and wine. We were both very happy. If I had to describe the food, I'd say it was decedent,and intense. My lamb dish was so huge, it presented like a dare. It wasn't prepared like your usual lamb, in that it was not Mediterranean inspired. It actually reminded me a lot of the food I ate in Prague - made to keep you full and warm. It had a dark aroma - of spices I did not recognize but enjoyed. The Oysters were meaty and briny, and served with a very spicy homemade hot sauce. The star of our night was desert, Marjolaine (a painstaking, many-layered chocolate and hazelnut cake). It was the best desert I've ever had in my life. For those Anthony Bordain fans morjolaine was featured in the No Reservations, Quebec episode. There is also a recipe for it in Joe Beef's cookbook. Anyways, making a pilgrimage to Joe Beef should definitely be on any foodie's vacation itinerary. The food, atmosphere, and service were wonderful. I felt right at home in my comfy booth, tearing through animal parts and slogging beer.Food 5 / 5 decor 5 / 5 service 5 / 5 We were 4, made reservations 2 months prior. Everything about the experience was perfection, one of the best part of joe beef is that you get top notch quality without the snootiness. You can get there in a suit, or in sweats, it won't matter because everyone is there for one reason: hearty, meaty, and delicious cuisine du terroir. The staff knows the food inside out as if they've cooked everything themselves.1. Smoked trout 26$2. Duck terrine 17$3. Large pulled pork with butternut squash gnocchis (regular 27$ large 40.50$) 4. Roasted Fowl 66$5. Side of bone marrow 16$6. Order of fries with parmesan flakes 8$7. Pear pie with housemade Pear and clove ice cream 16$+ 2 bottles of wine (white 65$ and red 65$)+ 3 coffees (3$ each)Everything above was shared. With tax and a 15% tip our total was 435$. For me, the pulled pork stole the show,  it's as if the meat just melted in your mouth, it was so tender. And the ice cream I would buy by the gallon if I could.It's been a while since I wrote a review but I've been busy enjoying life.  Anyways, here goes a review of a highly recommended restaurant I went in Montreal earlier this month.  I came with a friend I haven't seen since college so needless to say, there was a lot we had to catch up on.The setting is quite intimate but it didn't hinder a good conversation.  What we didn't like was the menu.  It is a blackboard hung up high in the wall and written in French only.  The handwriting was like a doctor's prescription and the blackboard was not properly erased so it made reading the menu immensely difficult (not to mention I didn't bring my glasses or read French).I thought the service was ok.  My friend thought our server was a little pretentious.  Anyhow, at least they offered to sell me a half portion of their famous lobster spaghetti.  That allowed me to enjoy some oysters and Canadian sea urchin (uni) as appetizer.  It would be too much food otherwise.  Taste-wise, everything was on par and predictable.It is a pricey place so do save it for a special occasion.  Reservation necessary.As I watched our cheerful server patiently (and entertainingly) translate the French-language menu in its entirety, I was at first dubious, then astonished, and finally delighted.  It was a glimpse into the workings of an establishment of humble origins that has gained acclaim as one of Canada's premier restaurants.The service here is genuinely welcoming.  I am reminded of the graciousness that defines hospitality at a Danny Meyer restaurant.  Without hovering, our servers were there when needed.  From a fine wine list dominated by bottles in the triple digits, our server swiftly ascertained our preference for a lower end choice, then narrowed down a flavor profile in just a brief, bantering exchange.  It was near worth ordering a second bottle for.An argument can be made for two bottles.  Although renowned as a meat-centric restaurant, Joe Beef is equally at ease with seafood, so a sampling of both is reasonable.  One of their more impressive starters were two whole, small trout showered with seasonally fresh vegetables.  The tender meat is gently smoked, yielding a flavor that is surprisingly restrained: enough to accent, not enough to dominate.  Shellfish shined in an equally wonderful sausage of lobster and clams; plump, juicy, and brimming with the flavors of its ingredients.  If the starter menu isn't enough, a few quality, local raw bar options are offered.  Raw oysters are de rigueur, but more interesting was a fresh uni prepared in a light tomato sauce and served in its shell, or the sweet snow crab legs.Of course, it would be sinful to eschew meat at Joe Beef, which offers up a few sharable beef entrees, along with foie gras, Canadian smoked meat, duck, rabbit, horse, lamb, and chicken dishes.  Foie gras parfait is flawless; creamy and luxurious, perfectly offset by a bite of crisp, sharp radish on warm, crusty brioche.  The same brioche is molded like a nest around smooth horse tartare, although robust seasoning muffled the sweetness of raw horse.  Simple, expertly cooked duck breast was a marvel of flavor and succulence.It is easy to see how this utterly charming restaurant is as famed as it is.  It is not for a specific dish, gimmick, or personality.  With its constantly changing menu penned only on chalkboard, Joe Beef announces its allegiance to local, seasonal foods, and prepares them exceptionally well.  Add to that the warmth of the staff and a uniquely home-like atmosphere between its cozy, tavern-like space inside and a festive outdoor area reminiscent of a patio.  It makes for a highly enjoyable, low-key dining experience that seems effortless in execution yet must surely be anything but.  And it will have one thinking about a return visit as soon as possible.I LOVED our waitress! She was so friendly and down-to-earth. - I made my reservations 3 months in advance (that's the earliest you can make it) - It's a dimly-lit, tiny restaurant, very homey and intimate - They played some great music while we were there (biggie smalls and some frenchy music)- The menu is written on the chalkboard (behind people sitting in the restaurant) - just take a picture with your smart phone and look at the menu from your seat instead of cranking your neck around and struggling to read it - The waitress encourages you to get up from your seat to look at the menu and she can answer any questions or give you recommendations - Duck for 2 ($90) is HUGE and worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It comes with 2 pieces of foie gras and a duck leg (confit), and like a whole freakin duck. It was SO good. We couldn't finish and I was really sad. HUGE portions. - Corn chowder was delicious too - For dessert, I picked ice cream with concord grapes - it was very good. - I also got to pick at my neighbor's cake (we became friends after sitting so close for 2 hours) - 12 layers of buttercream As with any other French restaurants in Montreal, your meal will probably last 2 hours or longer.We were able to get a last minute reservation here the day of for 9ish. We thought we had lucked out. In some ways we did, in some ways we didn't.  It was a great meal but it was crazy expensive. I was under the impression that this place was small but it has expanded to a full rowhouse so capacity was not a problem. Couples shuffled in and out and there were 1 or 2 empty tables near us the entire time. It was kind of cramped as we were crammed in there. We were seated at a 2 top between 2 couples in the back. Our server was lovely and gave us great choices. It was so dark in there and the writing on the board is so narrow and squiggly there is no way you can see the board so you are completely at the server's mercy when it comes to food and wine choices. The choices she gave us was excellent tho but the prices were tremendously inflated. We got a CAD $110 bottle of wine which I found out on the internet was really a USD $38 bottle of wine so I guess it was the standard markup. We had a Great froie gras appetizer and I had the blue cheese rabbit while hubby had a steak that came overcooked. The server asked him about it and he said it was ok but she took the liberty of sending it back and giving him a rare one instead. I didn't know this at the time but for the prices we were about to pay, it was par for the course. His new steak took a while to come. So 2 bottles of wine, 1 appetizer and 2 main courses, 1 salad and a fruit dessert set us back  400 CAD.  It was about 14 CAD for a side salad add on and similar for a berries dessert with cream. They did give us a small complimentary tasting of another wine for the steak mishap. So...it was good but I'm not sure if it was $400 good. I LOVE French Canadian food and have eaten my way through Quebec City on two occasions not having paid nearly as much in a couple of days than what we did tonight. To make myself feel better, I just looked up the exchange rate so the meal was about 300 USD which sits a lot better in my stomach. Still, Joe Beef is kind of overrated but I'm glad we did it. If we were to come back, I'd definitely only have 1 bottle of wine, and skip the expensive extras like dessert and salad.After an anxious six week wait, the night finally came for dinner at Joe Beef! Pros:1. Service is impeccable. All of the staff is very knowledgeable, in-tune with the menu and attentive to allergies. They checked back at just the right frequency. No complaints at all here. 2. Food is definitely above average. Snow crab legs were incredible -- As our server said, they are in season right now so they were very sweet and didn't even need condiments. The lamb sausage was a tad too salty in my opinion and could have used more starch or veggie on the side to balance that out. The strip steak was flavourful but a little more tough than expected. The fries were cute in a mini Creuset but pretty standard in terms of taste. Cons: 1. Menu is only in French and on the blackboard. Being fully bilingual, I didn't mind at all that the menu was in French. More importantly, I just don't think it is practical to have the only version of the menu on the single blackboard that half the restaurant has their back up against. The ONLY thing that partially made up for it was the detail-oriented servers who could cater to individual questions. It just seemed like a bit of a drag for the server to repeat the menu so many times. 2. In terms of value, sad to say that Joe Beef didn't live up to the hype this time. I'm all about paying good money for dinner but we both agreed that the meal just didn't live up to the long wait for reservations and the price.To try next time: - Lobster spaghetti - Rib steak for 2Lives up to the hype. Other than my appetizer being a little over seasoned (fresh pasta with venison), I only have good things to say. Our waitress did an excellent job guiding us through a somewhat cryptic menu on the chalk board and the end result was a memorable three course dinner. The next time a friend from out of town asks me where they should eat when they come to Montreal, I'll probably tell them to go to Joe Beef.Oh my God, Yumm!My Buddy had been frothing at the mouth to come up to Montreal and try this spot. Wouldn't stop talking about it, ha ha.So we did.We started with the Horse Tar Tar, and tell you the truth, with enough of it, that could have been my meal, it was soooooo goooooood!He had the steak, I had the lamb.  The lamb was good, not great.  His steak was to die for. For sure I will be back and have the steak.Tip: the servers in Canada are quite honest about what's good and tasty on the menu, so if they suggest anything, go for it! We almost balked at the horse tar tar, and it ended up being other-wordly!A good restaurant, but not a great one at the time of my visit.We were able to squeeze in a reservation for two at the bar, and were very excited given all the hype this restaurant has. But it just didn't meet those expectations for me. We each had a glass of wine, then followed with the local buffalo mozzarella appetizer which came with 2 slivers of fish and 2 slices of rye toast. The cheese was lovely, but nothing to write home about; it's fresh mozzarella? Next we had the smoked meat croquettes which were really good, easily the highlight of the meal -- it's everything you love about smoked meat squished up into a little tater-tot sized bite with a pickle on top. For entrees, we split the gentleman's steak with bleu cheese and while it was extremely well cooked (rare) it was really pricey for what amounted to a properly cooked steak with a scoop of garlic spinach on the side. However the portion is huge, so if you split it between two it's actually pretty reasonable. For dessert we had the strawberry and pistachio gratin, which was hyped up a lot by the bar staff. The berries were too early to be flavorful so they macerated them in sugar to increase the flavor. The creamy pistachio flan was amazing though! In all, it was a meal with highs (pistachio flan in the strawberry dessert & smoked meat croquettes) and okay points. For a restaurant of it's reputation, we expected more. The ambiance is great, the staff is helpful, but if you're and english speaker you're out of luck -- the menu is in french and only written on one chalkboard. Thankfully I speak french and was able to get by, but I can see how it's hard for others.Great place, note that the menu is 100% in French.One of the single best meals I've ever had. I know it either had to be amazing or grossly overrated as we made reservations 2.5 months in advance and could only score a table at 10PM on a Thursday evening. Needless to say, I had very high expectations for Joe Beef and JB graciously blew those expectations out of the water. The whole menu is in French on a chalkboard on the wall. Luckily, I picked up some French in High School and College and was able to navigate our nosh options well enough. If French wasn't your thang in school then the waiters will give ya a hand with the translation. We also did our homework and mostly knew what we wanted. The goods: We ordered some of the house pickles along with some of their housemade sourdough with butter which were a delicious beginning to the meal. Next was the sliced ham with mushrooms. I have to say this was one of the best bites of food I have ever had the pleasure of consuming. The ham was so wonderfully soft and fresh. The mushrooms were exploding with flavor and then there was a drizzle of a light cream sauce over top. This dish was absolutely divine. Next came the Lobster Spaghetti. If you think you're too old for spaghetti, get over it and order this right now! GIant chunks of lobster + claws served in a heavy cream sauce with over spaghetti. It was so heavy, but worth every artery clogging bite!For dessert we ordered a Strawberry dish that was absolutely incredible. The Strawberries are shipped down from a farm just north of Montreal and they were so amazingly tart, tangy, and fresh. It made me feel as if I had never tasted a strawberry before and I was tasting them for the first time. Yes, sounds exaggerated but it was that good! Our waiter Patrick was absolutely wonderful! He was great on offering suggestions (we asked him to suggest the appetizer for us). He was hysterical, kind, and super quirky.   Perfect meal in the heart of Little Burgundy.Come here prepared to for meat and calorie overload!  But it is exceptionally good and the service was remarkable.  Very simply if you're traveling to the Montreal area you have to go to Joe Beef.  Oh, but plan ahead, they were booked 2 months in advance.

Just make sure you make a reservation ASAP, Joe Beef is just so popular and definitely worth all the hype!Joe Beef is really freakin' good.  It's been about 2 months since I've eaten there while vacationing in Montreal and I still think fondly back on it.The menu rotates pretty often - but for what it's worth - we grabbed the whole flounder with lobster bisque gravy (came with a side of mussels and lobster cream sauced veggies), slow-cooked lamb neck with sausage, seared scallops and foie gras parfait.Other than the scallops (which was fresh and perfectly cooked, but definitely hard to break the mold), everything else was exceptional.  The weirdest thing was the foie gras parfait - which was raw foie gras whipped with egg yolks and paired with tart (rather than sweet) cherries and cherry jam.  It was very strange (seriously, foie for a 'dessert' appetizer) but it worked.  It came in a big bowl so whatever we didn't have on the bread was added as a topping to everything else.  I wish the lamb neck was a bit gamier, but still excellent.  Finally, the flounder was spectacular.Service was excellent.  We were immediately seated after confirming our reservation (if you are planning a trip - do make reservations well in advance).  The service was atypical - friendly but very relaxed.  The menu board is extremely difficult for non-French speakers to read due to the dim lights.  Our waiter just told us he recommended 'everything' but was very knowledgeable, answered all our questions and gauged our appetites well as he told us to stop ordering as he was confident we had 'more than enough' food and he was right.  He really steered us to configure an optimal meal that satisfied everyone at the table considering some unique dietary restrictions.Also, the meal was surprisingly affordable.  With everything mentioned and two beers, the bill came to $65 each for the four of us - tax and tip included.Easily the best restaurant I've been to in Canada.Did not live up to the hype for me: *the smoked meat croquettes were little salt bombs and a bit one note for me.  The sliced pickles just added to the sodium.*seemed dingy inside and there were flies in the restaurant, but thought all the knick knacks strewn throughout were nice photo ops*the horse tartare is phenomenal, loved the shaved matsutakes and the brioche, heavenly.  Best red meat tartare I have ever had.  *if you must get the lobster pasta, get the half portion, it was just okay, pasta al dente, the shellfish could have been better, heavy, creamy, could have used more fresh herbs and again, a lot of the same flavor*veal, escargot and bone marrow, impressive looking dish and was more like short rib type meat than a steak-just falls apart.  Very good and very rich.  Tip: take a photo of the chalkboard and read the menu from your device.  Everyone was struggling and craning their necks.  It's been rather warm the last week, no AC at JB.  Loved our little window nook booth, but I think the garden would have been a great alternative.Reasonable pricing $160 CAD for 4 items, 2 glasses of wine, tax and tip.  We were stuffed.  Great servers and interesting meal, but my least favorite planned meal of the trip.This is my second favorite restaurant in Montreal, ranked only below it's sister restaurant, Liverpool House. Before I get into my review, first, a confession. I came here, too, because of Anthony Bordain. I am not proud of it, I wish I was a cool-kid Montreal-er, but alas I am merely a uni-lingual American.  In fact, my boyfriend and I designed a whole vacation around getting a reservation at Joe Beef. The atmosphere: Joe Beef is simultaneously sexy and casual. It has dark mood lighting, but hockey memorabilia decor. They play Neil Young and French singers I do not recognize. Your plates and glasses are mismatched, and appear to come from a cool thrift store. The bar is boisterous-  ladies cackling, men singing, loud debates amounting, etc. ( an example from our dinner: whether Americans are bigger prudes than Canadians). The staff are irreverent and knowledgeable. Almost all of them seem to have a gleam of mischievous in their eyes. The Food: I ordered some sort of lamb sausage plate, the cocktail of the day (x3), and PEI oysters. My other half ordered the pheasant and wine. We were both very happy. If I had to describe the food, I'd say it was decedent,and intense. My lamb dish was so huge, it presented like a dare. It wasn't prepared like your usual lamb, in that it was not Mediterranean inspired. It actually reminded me a lot of the food I ate in Prague - made to keep you full and warm. It had a dark aroma - of spices I did not recognize but enjoyed. The Oysters were meaty and briny, and served with a very spicy homemade hot sauce. The star of our night was desert, Marjolaine (a painstaking, many-layered chocolate and hazelnut cake). It was the best desert I've ever had in my life. For those Anthony Bordain fans morjolaine was featured in the No Reservations, Quebec episode. There is also a recipe for it in Joe Beef's cookbook. Anyways, making a pilgrimage to Joe Beef should definitely be on any foodie's vacation itinerary. The food, atmosphere, and service were wonderful. I felt right at home in my comfy booth, tearing through animal parts and slogging beer.Food 5 / 5 decor 5 / 5 service 5 / 5 We were 4, made reservations 2 months prior. Everything about the experience was perfection, one of the best part of joe beef is that you get top notch quality without the snootiness. You can get there in a suit, or in sweats, it won't matter because everyone is there for one reason: hearty, meaty, and delicious cuisine du terroir. The staff knows the food inside out as if they've cooked everything themselves.1. Smoked trout 26$2. Duck terrine 17$3. Large pulled pork with butternut squash gnocchis (regular 27$ large 40.50$) 4.

Pear pie with housemade Pear and clove ice cream 16$+ 2 bottles of wine (white 65$ and red 65$)+ 3 coffees (3$ each)Everything above was shared. With tax and a 15% tip our total was 435$. For me, the pulled pork stole the show,  it's as if the meat just melted in your mouth, it was so tender. And the ice cream I would buy by the gallon if I could.It's been a while since I wrote a review but I've been busy enjoying life.  Anyways, here goes a review of a highly recommended restaurant I went in Montreal earlier this month.  I came with a friend I haven't seen since college so needless to say, there was a lot we had to catch up on.The setting is quite intimate but it didn't hinder a good conversation.  What we didn't like was the menu.  It is a blackboard hung up high in the wall and written in French only.  The handwriting was like a doctor's prescription and the blackboard was not properly erased so it made reading the menu immensely difficult (not to mention I didn't bring my glasses or read French).I thought the service was ok.  My friend thought our server was a little pretentious.  Anyhow, at least they offered to sell me a half portion of their famous lobster spaghetti.  That allowed me to enjoy some oysters and Canadian sea urchin (uni) as appetizer.  It would be too much food otherwise.  Taste-wise, everything was on par and predictable.It is a pricey place so do save it for a special occasion.  Reservation necessary.As I watched our cheerful server patiently (and entertainingly) translate the French-language menu in its entirety, I was at first dubious, then astonished, and finally delighted.  It was a glimpse into the workings of an establishment of humble origins that has gained acclaim as one of Canada's premier restaurants.The service here is genuinely welcoming.  I am reminded of the graciousness that defines hospitality at a Danny Meyer restaurant.  Without hovering, our servers were there when needed.  From a fine wine list dominated by bottles in the triple digits, our server swiftly ascertained our preference for a lower end choice, then narrowed down a flavor profile in just a brief, bantering exchange.  It was near worth ordering a second bottle for.An argument can be made for two bottles.  Although renowned as a meat-centric restaurant, Joe Beef is equally at ease with seafood, so a sampling of both is reasonable.  One of their more impressive starters were two whole, small trout showered with seasonally fresh vegetables.  The tender meat is gently smoked, yielding a flavor that is surprisingly restrained: enough to accent, not enough to dominate.  Shellfish shined in an equally wonderful sausage of lobster and clams; plump, juicy, and brimming with the flavors of its ingredients.  If the starter menu isn't enough, a few quality, local raw bar options are offered.  Raw oysters are de rigueur, but more interesting was a fresh uni prepared in a light tomato sauce and served in its shell, or the sweet snow crab legs.Of course, it would be sinful to eschew meat at Joe Beef, which offers up a few sharable beef entrees, along with foie gras, Canadian smoked meat, duck, rabbit, horse, lamb, and chicken dishes.  Foie gras parfait is flawless; creamy and luxurious, perfectly offset by a bite of crisp, sharp radish on warm, crusty brioche.  The same brioche is molded like a nest around smooth horse tartare, although robust seasoning muffled the sweetness of raw horse.  Simple, expertly cooked duck breast was a marvel of flavor and succulence.It is easy to see how this utterly charming restaurant is as famed as it is.  It is not for a specific dish, gimmick, or personality.  With its constantly changing menu penned only on chalkboard, Joe Beef announces its allegiance to local, seasonal foods, and prepares them exceptionally well.  Add to that the warmth of the staff and a uniquely home-like atmosphere between its cozy, tavern-like space inside and a festive outdoor area reminiscent of a patio.  It makes for a highly enjoyable, low-key dining experience that seems effortless in execution yet must surely be anything but.  And it will have one thinking about a return visit as soon as possible.I LOVED our waitress! She was so friendly and down-to-earth. - I made my reservations 3 months in advance (that's the earliest you can make it) - It's a dimly-lit, tiny restaurant, very homey and intimate - They played some great music while we were there (biggie smalls and some frenchy music)- The menu is written on the chalkboard (behind people sitting in the restaurant) - just take a picture with your smart phone and look at the menu from your seat instead of cranking your neck around and struggling to read it - The waitress encourages you to get up from your seat to look at the menu and she can answer any questions or give you recommendations - Duck for 2 ($90) is HUGE and worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It comes with 2 pieces of foie gras and a duck leg (confit), and like a whole freakin duck. It was SO good. We couldn't finish and I was really sad. HUGE portions. - Corn chowder was delicious too - For dessert, I picked ice cream with concord grapes - it was very good. - I also got to pick at my neighbor's cake (we became friends after sitting so close for 2 hours) - 12 layers of buttercream As with any other French restaurants in Montreal, your meal will probably last 2 hours or longer.We were able to get a last minute reservation here the day of for 9ish. We thought we had lucked out. In some ways we did, in some ways we didn't.  It was a great meal but it was crazy expensive. I was under the impression that this place was small but it has expanded to a full rowhouse so capacity was not a problem. Couples shuffled in and out and there were 1 or 2 empty tables near us the entire time. It was kind of cramped as we were crammed in there. We were seated at a 2 top between 2 couples in the back. Our server was lovely and gave us great choices. It was so dark in there and the writing on the board is so narrow and squiggly there is no way you can see the board so you are completely at the server's mercy when it comes to food and wine choices. The choices she gave us was excellent tho but the prices were tremendously inflated. We got a CAD $110 bottle of wine which I found out on the internet was really a USD $38 bottle of wine so I guess it was the standard markup. We had a Great froie gras appetizer and I had the blue cheese rabbit while hubby had a steak that came overcooked. The server asked him about it and he said it was ok but she took the liberty of sending it back and giving him a rare one instead. I didn't know this at the time but for the prices we were about to pay, it was par for the course. His new steak took a while to come. So 2 bottles of wine, 1 appetizer and 2 main courses, 1 salad and a fruit dessert set us back  400 CAD.  It was about 14 CAD for a side salad add on and similar for a berries dessert with cream. They did give us a small complimentary tasting of another wine for the steak mishap. So...it was good but I'm not sure if it was $400 good. I LOVE French Canadian food and have eaten my way through Quebec City on two occasions not having paid nearly as much in a couple of days than what we did tonight. To make myself feel better, I just looked up the exchange rate so the meal was about 300 USD which sits a lot better in my stomach. Still, Joe Beef is kind of overrated but I'm glad we did it. If we were to come back, I'd definitely only have 1 bottle of wine, and skip the expensive extras like dessert and salad.After an anxious six week wait, the night finally came for dinner at Joe Beef! Pros:1. Service is impeccable. All of the staff is very knowledgeable, in-tune with the menu and attentive to allergies. They checked back at just the right frequency. No complaints at all here. 2. Food is definitely above average. Snow crab legs were incredible -- As our server said, they are in season right now so they were very sweet and didn't even need condiments. The lamb sausage was a tad too salty in my opinion and could have used more starch or veggie on the side to balance that out. The strip steak was flavourful but a little more tough than expected. The fries were cute in a mini Creuset but pretty standard in terms of taste. Cons: 1. Menu is only in French and on the blackboard. Being fully bilingual, I didn't mind at all that the menu was in French. More importantly, I just don't think it is practical to have the only version of the menu on the single blackboard that half the restaurant has their back up against. The ONLY thing that partially made up for it was the detail-oriented servers who could cater to individual questions. It just seemed like a bit of a drag for the server to repeat the menu so many times. 2. In terms of value, sad to say that Joe Beef didn't live up to the hype this time. I'm all about paying good money for dinner but we both agreed that the meal just didn't live up to the long wait for reservations and the price.To try next time: - Lobster spaghetti - Rib steak for 2Lives up to the hype. Other than my appetizer being a little over seasoned (fresh pasta with venison), I only have good things to say. Our waitress did an excellent job guiding us through a somewhat cryptic menu on the chalk board and the end result was a memorable three course dinner. The next time a friend from out of town asks me where they should eat when they come to Montreal, I'll probably tell them to go to Joe Beef.Oh my God, Yumm!My Buddy had been frothing at the mouth to come up to Montreal and try this spot. Wouldn't stop talking about it, ha ha.So we did.We started with the Horse Tar Tar, and tell you the truth, with enough of it, that could have been my meal, it was soooooo goooooood!He had the steak, I had the lamb.  The lamb was good, not great.  His steak was to die for. For sure I will be back and have the steak.Tip: the servers in Canada are quite honest about what's good and tasty on the menu, so if they suggest anything, go for it! We almost balked at the horse tar tar, and it ended up being other-wordly!A good restaurant, but not a great one at the time of my visit.We were able to squeeze in a reservation for two at the bar, and were very excited given all the hype this restaurant has. But it just didn't meet those expectations for me. We each had a glass of wine, then followed with the local buffalo mozzarella appetizer which came with 2 slivers of fish and 2 slices of rye toast. The cheese was lovely, but nothing to write home about; it's fresh mozzarella? Next we had the smoked meat croquettes which were really good, easily the highlight of the meal -- it's everything you love about smoked meat squished up into a little tater-tot sized bite with a pickle on top. For entrees, we split the gentleman's steak with bleu cheese and while it was extremely well cooked (rare) it was really pricey for what amounted to a properly cooked steak with a scoop of garlic spinach on the side. However the portion is huge, so if you split it between two it's actually pretty reasonable. For dessert we had the strawberry and pistachio gratin, which was hyped up a lot by the bar staff. The berries were too early to be flavorful so they macerated them in sugar to increase the flavor. The creamy pistachio flan was amazing though! In all, it was a meal with highs (pistachio flan in the strawberry dessert & smoked meat croquettes) and okay points. For a restaurant of it's reputation, we expected more. The ambiance is great, the staff is helpful, but if you're and english speaker you're out of luck -- the menu is in french and only written on one chalkboard. Thankfully I speak french and was able to get by, but I can see how it's hard for others.Great place, note that the menu is 100% in French.One of the single best meals I've ever had. I know it either had to be amazing or grossly overrated as we made reservations 2.5 months in advance and could only score a table at 10PM on a Thursday evening. Needless to say, I had very high expectations for Joe Beef and JB graciously blew those expectations out of the water. The whole menu is in French on a chalkboard on the wall. Luckily, I picked up some French in High School and College and was able to navigate our nosh options well enough. If French wasn't your thang in school then the waiters will give ya a hand with the translation. We also did our homework and mostly knew what we wanted. The goods: We ordered some of the house pickles along with some of their housemade sourdough with butter which were a delicious beginning to the meal. Next was the sliced ham with mushrooms. I have to say this was one of the best bites of food I have ever had the pleasure of consuming. The ham was so wonderfully soft and fresh. The mushrooms were exploding with flavor and then there was a drizzle of a light cream sauce over top. This dish was absolutely divine. Next came the Lobster Spaghetti. If you think you're too old for spaghetti, get over it and order this right now! GIant chunks of lobster + claws served in a heavy cream sauce with over spaghetti. It was so heavy, but worth every artery clogging bite!For dessert we ordered a Strawberry dish that was absolutely incredible. The Strawberries are shipped down from a farm just north of Montreal and they were so amazingly tart, tangy, and fresh. It made me feel as if I had never tasted a strawberry before and I was tasting them for the first time. Yes, sounds exaggerated but it was that good! Our waiter Patrick was absolutely wonderful! He was great on offering suggestions (we asked him to suggest the appetizer for us). He was hysterical, kind, and super quirky.   Perfect meal in the heart of Little Burgundy.Come here prepared to for meat and calorie overload!  But it is exceptionally good and the service was remarkable.  Very simply if you're traveling to the Montreal area you have to go to Joe Beef.  Oh, but plan ahead, they were booked 2 months in advance. I just got lucky with getting a last minute seat at the bar.This place is amazing.  It epitomizes everything you would want in a restaurant named Joe Beef and combines it with impeccable service, awesome attitude and a great ambiance.  Joe Beef isn't a large space (I believe there are two sides) so reservations are a must.  We had a party of 8 reserved into two groups of 4, but the hostess didn't drop a beat when we told her 2 in our party were delayed.  She seated us in an awesome table for 6 but most importantly paired us with one of the best waitresses I've ever had.  She clearly saw that we were tourists, but that's one thing that I loved about Montreal.  Many of the cool places that we went to, they welcome and are friendly to tourists and this place was no different.  It looked like it was full of French Canadians, but you couldn't tell as they effortlessly switched from English to French catering to their customer.  The menu is a revolving one and written only on the chalkboard nightly, so describing the dishes accurately is almost impossible.  Suffice it to say everything was amazing and it was easily one of the best meat-centric meals I've had in my life.  I was in heaven.  We started off with drinks and I never saw a cocktail menu but the waitress was able to order everyone drinks they loved based on just a brief description of base drink preference (ie: gin, vodka, etc.)  The drinks are strong and tasty and while perhaps not as complex as the artisinal cocktails we had at Lab just before, they were good.  I had no idea how much they cost either.  Then we started off with appetizers.  She knew we were familiar with the famous Foie Gras double down but informed us they no longer sold it.  She saw our sad faces and said would order a selection that would make us happy.  Our waitress never pushed any item (ie: their oysters are famous, but we didn't feel like any) and it really was one of the most fun and engaging ordering experiences I've had.  Foie Gras Small Bites - deep fried and filled with tiny bits of foie gras and potato.  Delicious.  This place knows meat, fried, and smoked.Mozzarella served with Toast - fresh mozzarella cheese sliced and served with toast.  A nice change and balance to all the meat.Sunnyside up Duck Eggs with Pomme Frites - I've never had eggs this good and I've sous vide many eggs. This was better.  It was super rich, seasoned perfectly and the fries were amazing.Foie Gras And Ham Sandwich - this was to make up for the double down.  Split 6 ways, we each only got a small bite, but the salty foie gras sauce and milder ham went with the decant biscuit bread with sauce.  Puff Pastry with Smoked Turkey - our waitresses favorite appetizer.  It was good but tasted a bit like turkey with small bread puffs.  Not interesting enough.Minced Duck and Seared Foie Gras - the duck looked like a steak but broke into parts of duck meat.  The seared foie gras on top was delicious and the berry sauce was a perfect contrast.  Venison Sausage - loved it.  Did I say they do meats well?Lobster Spaghetti - another famous dish.  Whole lobster with cream sauce and perfect al dente noodles.  One of my favorites of the night.  Seared Rib Eye Steak - seasoned perfectly, cooked perfectly, finished completely.Horse Meat Filet Mignon - wrapped with bacon and served with potatoes.  This was a novelty as I've never had horse meat.  Cooked perfectly medium rare the meat was delicious and a very different texture than any meat I've had.  Worth trying once.  Deep Fried Cauliflower - covered in cheese but an obligatory vegetable.Lamb Steak - yet another meat, cooked so perfectly and completely different flavor.  Duck Fat Fries - the perfect starch to complement the meat.  We were too full from drink and food for dessert but finished our meal with laughter with the staff learning French phrases, sharing the best spots for food and merriment and finishing with shots on the house.  Our bill wasn't cheap but the final price was less than I guessed.  It also was one of the best meat meals I've had in my life.  I missed Au Pied du Cochon but I don't think I would have wanted to trade away Joe Beef.  Joe Beef accepts credit cards.A pure 5 star rating without a doubt in my mind. We came to Montreal to specifically go to Joe Beef and it was certainly worth it! Rated one of the most difficult places to get a reservation, we booked many moons ahead of time. Upon arrival, we noticed all the menu items were written on a chalk board. Having poor vision, combined with dimmed lighting, I opted to go with the chefs choice for 6 courses.  It relieved us of the stress of deciding what we should share while adding a layer of anticipation and surprise.  Out waiter was terrific as he attended multiple tables with his cat shirt in celebration of National Cat Day.Favorite dishes: bone marrow, calamari stuffed with meat in a red wine mushroom sauce and apple donuts with smoked Gouda.While everything was perfectly cooked, a bit too salty on some of the more savory items.  Just a general preference of mine, but it didn't stop me from eating everything!How many times have I come to Montreal and NOT eaten here???  This place is amazing!!!  Fish of the day for two: perfectly cooked white fish in a butter wine sauce with roe mixed in, served with a side of clams and little potatoes.  Horse filet mignon (unreal), tender, cooked medium rare, it was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  Served with mashed potatoes.  Duck dish topped with a piece of foie gras.  This came with a side of vegetable but I cannot recall at this point.Even the soft serve ice cream was yummy.  A refreshing end to a most decadent meal.  Everything was fantastic.  I would come back here in an instant.  I would recommend it to everyone!I loved everything about this restaurant.  The food, the service... it was the highlight of my weekend!This place is exceptionally good!Geez- I don't know where to begin. Our table of four shared about a dozen dishes. The highlights being the Horse Tartare, a pasta with Fois Gras and deer shoulder, the smoked crispy fried trout, and the New York Strip with blue cheese.The cocktails were kinda meh.......... but the service and general experience was all on point.I would visit Joe Beef again in a heartbeat. It's one of the best dining experiences I have had.If I have a Jen K's Top 10 Restaurant List, Joe Beef would definitely be on it. And in fact, I might even able to say My Last Meal on Earth I want to have it here. (Yelp's profile question and they do serves uni!)I have been to Liverpool House, Joe Beef's sister restaurant right next door but Joe Beef is the real deal.The menu is seasonal but interesting. A mixture of seafood and meat and even vegetables. And of course foie gras!Everything we ordered were amazing. And the wait staff is just so knowledgeable with the menu and able to make awesome recommendations.The vibe is relaxing especially out on the back patio on a nice summer evening. And of these for a reasonable price! Just make sure you make a reservation ASAP, Joe Beef is just so popular and definitely worth all the hype!Joe Beef is really freakin' good.  It's been about 2 months since I've eaten there while vacationing in Montreal and I still think fondly back on it.The menu rotates pretty often - but for what it's worth - we grabbed the whole flounder with lobster bisque gravy (came with a side of mussels and lobster cream sauced veggies), slow-cooked lamb neck with sausage, seared scallops and foie gras parfait.Other than the scallops (which was fresh and perfectly cooked, but definitely hard to break the mold), everything else was exceptional.  The weirdest thing was the foie gras parfait - which was raw foie gras whipped with egg yolks and paired with tart (rather than sweet) cherries and cherry jam.  It was very strange (seriously, foie for a 'dessert' appetizer) but it worked.  It came in a big bowl so whatever we didn't have on the bread was added as a topping to everything else.  I wish the lamb neck was a bit gamier, but still excellent.  Finally, the flounder was spectacular.Service was excellent.  We were immediately seated after confirming our reservation (if you are planning a trip - do make reservations well in advance).  The service was atypical - friendly but very relaxed.  The menu board is extremely difficult for non-French speakers to read due to the dim lights.  Our waiter just told us he recommended 'everything' but was very knowledgeable, answered all our questions and gauged our appetites well as he told us to stop ordering as he was confident we had 'more than enough' food and he was right.  He really steered us to configure an optimal meal that satisfied everyone at the table considering some unique dietary restrictions.Also, the meal was surprisingly affordable.  With everything mentioned and two beers, the bill came to $65 each for the four of us - tax and tip included.Easily the best restaurant I've been to in Canada.Did not live up to the hype for me: *the smoked meat croquettes were little salt bombs and a bit one note for me.  The sliced pickles just added to the sodium.*seemed dingy inside and there were flies in the restaurant, but thought all the knick knacks strewn throughout were nice photo ops*the horse tartare is phenomenal, loved the shaved matsutakes and the brioche, heavenly.  Best red meat tartare I have ever had.  *if you must get the lobster pasta, get the half portion, it was just okay, pasta al dente, the shellfish could have been better, heavy, creamy, could have used more fresh herbs and again, a lot of the same flavor*veal, escargot and bone marrow, impressive looking dish and was more like short rib type meat than a steak-just falls apart.  Very good and very rich.  Tip: take a photo of the chalkboard and read the menu from your device.  Everyone was struggling and craning their necks.  It's been rather warm the last week, no AC at JB.  Loved our little window nook booth, but I think the garden would have been a great alternative.Reasonable pricing $160 CAD for 4 items, 2 glasses of wine, tax and tip.  We were stuffed.  Great servers and interesting meal, but my least favorite planned meal of the trip.This is my second favorite restaurant in Montreal, ranked only below it's sister restaurant, Liverpool House.

And the ice cream I would buy by the gallon if I could.It's been a while since I wrote a review but I've been busy enjoying life.  Anyways, here goes a review of a highly recommended restaurant I went in Montreal earlier this month.  I came with a friend I haven't seen since college so needless to say, there was a lot we had to catch up on.The setting is quite intimate but it didn't hinder a good conversation.  What we didn't like was the menu.  It is a blackboard hung up high in the wall and written in French only.  The handwriting was like a doctor's prescription and the blackboard was not properly erased so it made reading the menu immensely difficult (not to mention I didn't bring my glasses or read French).I thought the service was ok.  My friend thought our server was a little pretentious.  Anyhow, at least they offered to sell me a half portion of their famous lobster spaghetti.  That allowed me to enjoy some oysters and Canadian sea urchin (uni) as appetizer.  It would be too much food otherwise.  Taste-wise, everything was on par and predictable.It is a pricey place so do save it for a special occasion.  Reservation necessary.As I watched our cheerful server patiently (and entertainingly) translate the French-language menu in its entirety, I was at first dubious, then astonished, and finally delighted.  It was a glimpse into the workings of an establishment of humble origins that has gained acclaim as one of Canada's premier restaurants.The service here is genuinely welcoming.  I am reminded of the graciousness that defines hospitality at a Danny Meyer restaurant.  Without hovering, our servers were there when needed.  From a fine wine list dominated by bottles in the triple digits, our server swiftly ascertained our preference for a lower end choice, then narrowed down a flavor profile in just a brief, bantering exchange.  It was near worth ordering a second bottle for.An argument can be made for two bottles.  Although renowned as a meat-centric restaurant, Joe Beef is equally at ease with seafood, so a sampling of both is reasonable.  One of their more impressive starters were two whole, small trout showered with seasonally fresh vegetables.  The tender meat is gently smoked, yielding a flavor that is surprisingly restrained: enough to accent, not enough to dominate.  Shellfish shined in an equally wonderful sausage of lobster and clams; plump, juicy, and brimming with the flavors of its ingredients.  If the starter menu isn't enough, a few quality, local raw bar options are offered.  Raw oysters are de rigueur, but more interesting was a fresh uni prepared in a light tomato sauce and served in its shell, or the sweet snow crab legs.Of course, it would be sinful to eschew meat at Joe Beef, which offers up a few sharable beef entrees, along with foie gras, Canadian smoked meat, duck, rabbit, horse, lamb, and chicken dishes.  Foie gras parfait is flawless; creamy and luxurious, perfectly offset by a bite of crisp, sharp radish on warm, crusty brioche.  The same brioche is molded like a nest around smooth horse tartare, although robust seasoning muffled the sweetness of raw horse.  Simple, expertly cooked duck breast was a marvel of flavor and succulence.It is easy to see how this utterly charming restaurant is as famed as it is.  It is not for a specific dish, gimmick, or personality.  With its constantly changing menu penned only on chalkboard, Joe Beef announces its allegiance to local, seasonal foods, and prepares them exceptionally well.  Add to that the warmth of the staff and a uniquely home-like atmosphere between its cozy, tavern-like space inside and a festive outdoor area reminiscent of a patio.  It makes for a highly enjoyable, low-key dining experience that seems effortless in execution yet must surely be anything but.  And it will have one thinking about a return visit as soon as possible.I LOVED our waitress! She was so friendly and down-to-earth. - I made my reservations 3 months in advance (that's the earliest you can make it) - It's a dimly-lit, tiny restaurant, very homey and intimate - They played some great music while we were there (biggie smalls and some frenchy music)- The menu is written on the chalkboard (behind people sitting in the restaurant) - just take a picture with your smart phone and look at the menu from your seat instead of cranking your neck around and struggling to read it - The waitress encourages you to get up from your seat to look at the menu and she can answer any questions or give you recommendations - Duck for 2 ($90) is HUGE and worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It comes with 2 pieces of foie gras and a duck leg (confit), and like a whole freakin duck. It was SO good. We couldn't finish and I was really sad. HUGE portions. - Corn chowder was delicious too - For dessert, I picked ice cream with concord grapes - it was very good. - I also got to pick at my neighbor's cake (we became friends after sitting so close for 2 hours) - 12 layers of buttercream As with any other French restaurants in Montreal, your meal will probably last 2 hours or longer.We were able to get a last minute reservation here the day of for 9ish. We thought we had lucked out. In some ways we did, in some ways we didn't.  It was a great meal but it was crazy expensive. I was under the impression that this place was small but it has expanded to a full rowhouse so capacity was not a problem. Couples shuffled in and out and there were 1 or 2 empty tables near us the entire time. It was kind of cramped as we were crammed in there. We were seated at a 2 top between 2 couples in the back. Our server was lovely and gave us great choices. It was so dark in there and the writing on the board is so narrow and squiggly there is no way you can see the board so you are completely at the server's mercy when it comes to food and wine choices. The choices she gave us was excellent tho but the prices were tremendously inflated. We got a CAD $110 bottle of wine which I found out on the internet was really a USD $38 bottle of wine so I guess it was the standard markup. We had a Great froie gras appetizer and I had the blue cheese rabbit while hubby had a steak that came overcooked. The server asked him about it and he said it was ok but she took the liberty of sending it back and giving him a rare one instead. I didn't know this at the time but for the prices we were about to pay, it was par for the course. His new steak took a while to come. So 2 bottles of wine, 1 appetizer and 2 main courses, 1 salad and a fruit dessert set us back  400 CAD.  It was about 14 CAD for a side salad add on and similar for a berries dessert with cream. They did give us a small complimentary tasting of another wine for the steak mishap. So...it was good but I'm not sure if it was $400 good. I LOVE French Canadian food and have eaten my way through Quebec City on two occasions not having paid nearly as much in a couple of days than what we did tonight. To make myself feel better, I just looked up the exchange rate so the meal was about 300 USD which sits a lot better in my stomach. Still, Joe Beef is kind of overrated but I'm glad we did it. If we were to come back, I'd definitely only have 1 bottle of wine, and skip the expensive extras like dessert and salad.After an anxious six week wait, the night finally came for dinner at Joe Beef! Pros:1. Service is impeccable. All of the staff is very knowledgeable, in-tune with the menu and attentive to allergies. They checked back at just the right frequency. No complaints at all here. 2. Food is definitely above average. Snow crab legs were incredible -- As our server said, they are in season right now so they were very sweet and didn't even need condiments. The lamb sausage was a tad too salty in my opinion and could have used more starch or veggie on the side to balance that out. The strip steak was flavourful but a little more tough than expected. The fries were cute in a mini Creuset but pretty standard in terms of taste. Cons: 1. Menu is only in French and on the blackboard. Being fully bilingual, I didn't mind at all that the menu was in French. More importantly, I just don't think it is practical to have the only version of the menu on the single blackboard that half the restaurant has their back up against. The ONLY thing that partially made up for it was the detail-oriented servers who could cater to individual questions. It just seemed like a bit of a drag for the server to repeat the menu so many times. 2. In terms of value, sad to say that Joe Beef didn't live up to the hype this time. I'm all about paying good money for dinner but we both agreed that the meal just didn't live up to the long wait for reservations and the price.To try next time: - Lobster spaghetti - Rib steak for 2Lives up to the hype. Other than my appetizer being a little over seasoned (fresh pasta with venison), I only have good things to say. Our waitress did an excellent job guiding us through a somewhat cryptic menu on the chalk board and the end result was a memorable three course dinner. The next time a friend from out of town asks me where they should eat when they come to Montreal, I'll probably tell them to go to Joe Beef.Oh my God, Yumm!My Buddy had been frothing at the mouth to come up to Montreal and try this spot. Wouldn't stop talking about it, ha ha.So we did.We started with the Horse Tar Tar, and tell you the truth, with enough of it, that could have been my meal, it was soooooo goooooood!He had the steak, I had the lamb.  The lamb was good, not great.  His steak was to die for. For sure I will be back and have the steak.Tip: the servers in Canada are quite honest about what's good and tasty on the menu, so if they suggest anything, go for it! We almost balked at the horse tar tar, and it ended up being other-wordly!A good restaurant, but not a great one at the time of my visit.We were able to squeeze in a reservation for two at the bar, and were very excited given all the hype this restaurant has. But it just didn't meet those expectations for me. We each had a glass of wine, then followed with the local buffalo mozzarella appetizer which came with 2 slivers of fish and 2 slices of rye toast. The cheese was lovely, but nothing to write home about; it's fresh mozzarella? Next we had the smoked meat croquettes which were really good, easily the highlight of the meal -- it's everything you love about smoked meat squished up into a little tater-tot sized bite with a pickle on top. For entrees, we split the gentleman's steak with bleu cheese and while it was extremely well cooked (rare) it was really pricey for what amounted to a properly cooked steak with a scoop of garlic spinach on the side. However the portion is huge, so if you split it between two it's actually pretty reasonable. For dessert we had the strawberry and pistachio gratin, which was hyped up a lot by the bar staff. The berries were too early to be flavorful so they macerated them in sugar to increase the flavor. The creamy pistachio flan was amazing though! In all, it was a meal with highs (pistachio flan in the strawberry dessert & smoked meat croquettes) and okay points. For a restaurant of it's reputation, we expected more. The ambiance is great, the staff is helpful, but if you're and english speaker you're out of luck -- the menu is in french and only written on one chalkboard. Thankfully I speak french and was able to get by, but I can see how it's hard for others.Great place, note that the menu is 100% in French.One of the single best meals I've ever had. I know it either had to be amazing or grossly overrated as we made reservations 2.5 months in advance and could only score a table at 10PM on a Thursday evening. Needless to say, I had very high expectations for Joe Beef and JB graciously blew those expectations out of the water. The whole menu is in French on a chalkboard on the wall. Luckily, I picked up some French in High School and College and was able to navigate our nosh options well enough. If French wasn't your thang in school then the waiters will give ya a hand with the translation. We also did our homework and mostly knew what we wanted. The goods: We ordered some of the house pickles along with some of their housemade sourdough with butter which were a delicious beginning to the meal. Next was the sliced ham with mushrooms. I have to say this was one of the best bites of food I have ever had the pleasure of consuming. The ham was so wonderfully soft and fresh. The mushrooms were exploding with flavor and then there was a drizzle of a light cream sauce over top. This dish was absolutely divine. Next came the Lobster Spaghetti. If you think you're too old for spaghetti, get over it and order this right now! GIant chunks of lobster + claws served in a heavy cream sauce with over spaghetti. It was so heavy, but worth every artery clogging bite!For dessert we ordered a Strawberry dish that was absolutely incredible. The Strawberries are shipped down from a farm just north of Montreal and they were so amazingly tart, tangy, and fresh. It made me feel as if I had never tasted a strawberry before and I was tasting them for the first time. Yes, sounds exaggerated but it was that good! Our waiter Patrick was absolutely wonderful! He was great on offering suggestions (we asked him to suggest the appetizer for us). He was hysterical, kind, and super quirky.   Perfect meal in the heart of Little Burgundy.Come here prepared to for meat and calorie overload!  But it is exceptionally good and the service was remarkable.  Very simply if you're traveling to the Montreal area you have to go to Joe Beef.  Oh, but plan ahead, they were booked 2 months in advance. I just got lucky with getting a last minute seat at the bar.This place is amazing.  It epitomizes everything you would want in a restaurant named Joe Beef and combines it with impeccable service, awesome attitude and a great ambiance.  Joe Beef isn't a large space (I believe there are two sides) so reservations are a must.  We had a party of 8 reserved into two groups of 4, but the hostess didn't drop a beat when we told her 2 in our party were delayed.  She seated us in an awesome table for 6 but most importantly paired us with one of the best waitresses I've ever had.  She clearly saw that we were tourists, but that's one thing that I loved about Montreal.  Many of the cool places that we went to, they welcome and are friendly to tourists and this place was no different.  It looked like it was full of French Canadians, but you couldn't tell as they effortlessly switched from English to French catering to their customer.  The menu is a revolving one and written only on the chalkboard nightly, so describing the dishes accurately is almost impossible.  Suffice it to say everything was amazing and it was easily one of the best meat-centric meals I've had in my life.  I was in heaven.  We started off with drinks and I never saw a cocktail menu but the waitress was able to order everyone drinks they loved based on just a brief description of base drink preference (ie: gin, vodka, etc.)  The drinks are strong and tasty and while perhaps not as complex as the artisinal cocktails we had at Lab just before, they were good.  I had no idea how much they cost either.  Then we started off with appetizers.  She knew we were familiar with the famous Foie Gras double down but informed us they no longer sold it.  She saw our sad faces and said would order a selection that would make us happy.  Our waitress never pushed any item (ie: their oysters are famous, but we didn't feel like any) and it really was one of the most fun and engaging ordering experiences I've had.  Foie Gras Small Bites - deep fried and filled with tiny bits of foie gras and potato.  Delicious.  This place knows meat, fried, and smoked.Mozzarella served with Toast - fresh mozzarella cheese sliced and served with toast.  A nice change and balance to all the meat.Sunnyside up Duck Eggs with Pomme Frites - I've never had eggs this good and I've sous vide many eggs. This was better.  It was super rich, seasoned perfectly and the fries were amazing.Foie Gras And Ham Sandwich - this was to make up for the double down.  Split 6 ways, we each only got a small bite, but the salty foie gras sauce and milder ham went with the decant biscuit bread with sauce.  Puff Pastry with Smoked Turkey - our waitresses favorite appetizer.  It was good but tasted a bit like turkey with small bread puffs.  Not interesting enough.Minced Duck and Seared Foie Gras - the duck looked like a steak but broke into parts of duck meat.  The seared foie gras on top was delicious and the berry sauce was a perfect contrast.  Venison Sausage - loved it.  Did I say they do meats well?Lobster Spaghetti - another famous dish.  Whole lobster with cream sauce and perfect al dente noodles.  One of my favorites of the night.  Seared Rib Eye Steak - seasoned perfectly, cooked perfectly, finished completely.Horse Meat Filet Mignon - wrapped with bacon and served with potatoes.  This was a novelty as I've never had horse meat.  Cooked perfectly medium rare the meat was delicious and a very different texture than any meat I've had.  Worth trying once.  Deep Fried Cauliflower - covered in cheese but an obligatory vegetable.Lamb Steak - yet another meat, cooked so perfectly and completely different flavor.  Duck Fat Fries - the perfect starch to complement the meat.  We were too full from drink and food for dessert but finished our meal with laughter with the staff learning French phrases, sharing the best spots for food and merriment and finishing with shots on the house.  Our bill wasn't cheap but the final price was less than I guessed.  It also was one of the best meat meals I've had in my life.  I missed Au Pied du Cochon but I don't think I would have wanted to trade away Joe Beef.  Joe Beef accepts credit cards.A pure 5 star rating without a doubt in my mind. We came to Montreal to specifically go to Joe Beef and it was certainly worth it! Rated one of the most difficult places to get a reservation, we booked many moons ahead of time. Upon arrival, we noticed all the menu items were written on a chalk board. Having poor vision, combined with dimmed lighting, I opted to go with the chefs choice for 6 courses.  It relieved us of the stress of deciding what we should share while adding a layer of anticipation and surprise.  Out waiter was terrific as he attended multiple tables with his cat shirt in celebration of National Cat Day.Favorite dishes: bone marrow, calamari stuffed with meat in a red wine mushroom sauce and apple donuts with smoked Gouda.While everything was perfectly cooked, a bit too salty on some of the more savory items.  Just a general preference of mine, but it didn't stop me from eating everything!How many times have I come to Montreal and NOT eaten here???  This place is amazing!!!  Fish of the day for two: perfectly cooked white fish in a butter wine sauce with roe mixed in, served with a side of clams and little potatoes.  Horse filet mignon (unreal), tender, cooked medium rare, it was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  Served with mashed potatoes.  Duck dish topped with a piece of foie gras.  This came with a side of vegetable but I cannot recall at this point.Even the soft serve ice cream was yummy.  A refreshing end to a most decadent meal.  Everything was fantastic.  I would come back here in an instant.  I would recommend it to everyone!I loved everything about this restaurant.  The food, the service... it was the highlight of my weekend!This place is exceptionally good!Geez- I don't know where to begin. Our table of four shared about a dozen dishes. The highlights being the Horse Tartare, a pasta with Fois Gras and deer shoulder, the smoked crispy fried trout, and the New York Strip with blue cheese.The cocktails were kinda meh.......... but the service and general experience was all on point.I would visit Joe Beef again in a heartbeat. It's one of the best dining experiences I have had.If I have a Jen K's Top 10 Restaurant List, Joe Beef would definitely be on it. And in fact, I might even able to say My Last Meal on Earth I want to have it here. (Yelp's profile question and they do serves uni!)I have been to Liverpool House, Joe Beef's sister restaurant right next door but Joe Beef is the real deal.The menu is seasonal but interesting. A mixture of seafood and meat and even vegetables. And of course foie gras!Everything we ordered were amazing. And the wait staff is just so knowledgeable with the menu and able to make awesome recommendations.The vibe is relaxing especially out on the back patio on a nice summer evening. And of these for a reasonable price! Just make sure you make a reservation ASAP, Joe Beef is just so popular and definitely worth all the hype!Joe Beef is really freakin' good.  It's been about 2 months since I've eaten there while vacationing in Montreal and I still think fondly back on it.The menu rotates pretty often - but for what it's worth - we grabbed the whole flounder with lobster bisque gravy (came with a side of mussels and lobster cream sauced veggies), slow-cooked lamb neck with sausage, seared scallops and foie gras parfait.Other than the scallops (which was fresh and perfectly cooked, but definitely hard to break the mold), everything else was exceptional.  The weirdest thing was the foie gras parfait - which was raw foie gras whipped with egg yolks and paired with tart (rather than sweet) cherries and cherry jam.  It was very strange (seriously, foie for a 'dessert' appetizer) but it worked.  It came in a big bowl so whatever we didn't have on the bread was added as a topping to everything else.  I wish the lamb neck was a bit gamier, but still excellent.  Finally, the flounder was spectacular.Service was excellent.  We were immediately seated after confirming our reservation (if you are planning a trip - do make reservations well in advance).  The service was atypical - friendly but very relaxed.  The menu board is extremely difficult for non-French speakers to read due to the dim lights.  Our waiter just told us he recommended 'everything' but was very knowledgeable, answered all our questions and gauged our appetites well as he told us to stop ordering as he was confident we had 'more than enough' food and he was right.  He really steered us to configure an optimal meal that satisfied everyone at the table considering some unique dietary restrictions.Also, the meal was surprisingly affordable.  With everything mentioned and two beers, the bill came to $65 each for the four of us - tax and tip included.Easily the best restaurant I've been to in Canada.Did not live up to the hype for me: *the smoked meat croquettes were little salt bombs and a bit one note for me.  The sliced pickles just added to the sodium.*seemed dingy inside and there were flies in the restaurant, but thought all the knick knacks strewn throughout were nice photo ops*the horse tartare is phenomenal, loved the shaved matsutakes and the brioche, heavenly.  Best red meat tartare I have ever had.  *if you must get the lobster pasta, get the half portion, it was just okay, pasta al dente, the shellfish could have been better, heavy, creamy, could have used more fresh herbs and again, a lot of the same flavor*veal, escargot and bone marrow, impressive looking dish and was more like short rib type meat than a steak-just falls apart.  Very good and very rich.  Tip: take a photo of the chalkboard and read the menu from your device.  Everyone was struggling and craning their necks.  It's been rather warm the last week, no AC at JB.  Loved our little window nook booth, but I think the garden would have been a great alternative.Reasonable pricing $160 CAD for 4 items, 2 glasses of wine, tax and tip.  We were stuffed.  Great servers and interesting meal, but my least favorite planned meal of the trip.This is my second favorite restaurant in Montreal, ranked only below it's sister restaurant, Liverpool House. Before I get into my review, first, a confession. I came here, too, because of Anthony Bordain. I am not proud of it, I wish I was a cool-kid Montreal-er, but alas I am merely a uni-lingual American.  In fact, my boyfriend and I designed a whole vacation around getting a reservation at Joe Beef. The atmosphere: Joe Beef is simultaneously sexy and casual. It has dark mood lighting, but hockey memorabilia decor. They play Neil Young and French singers I do not recognize. Your plates and glasses are mismatched, and appear to come from a cool thrift store. The bar is boisterous-  ladies cackling, men singing, loud debates amounting, etc. ( an example from our dinner: whether Americans are bigger prudes than Canadians). The staff are irreverent and knowledgeable. Almost all of them seem to have a gleam of mischievous in their eyes. The Food: I ordered some sort of lamb sausage plate, the cocktail of the day (x3), and PEI oysters. My other half ordered the pheasant and wine. We were both very happy. If I had to describe the food, I'd say it was decedent,and intense. My lamb dish was so huge, it presented like a dare. It wasn't prepared like your usual lamb, in that it was not Mediterranean inspired. It actually reminded me a lot of the food I ate in Prague - made to keep you full and warm. It had a dark aroma - of spices I did not recognize but enjoyed. The Oysters were meaty and briny, and served with a very spicy homemade hot sauce. The star of our night was desert, Marjolaine (a painstaking, many-layered chocolate and hazelnut cake). It was the best desert I've ever had in my life. For those Anthony Bordain fans morjolaine was featured in the No Reservations, Quebec episode. There is also a recipe for it in Joe Beef's cookbook. Anyways, making a pilgrimage to Joe Beef should definitely be on any foodie's vacation itinerary. The food, atmosphere, and service were wonderful. I felt right at home in my comfy booth, tearing through animal parts and slogging beer.Food 5 / 5 decor 5 / 5 service 5 / 5 We were 4, made reservations 2 months prior. Everything about the experience was perfection, one of the best part of joe beef is that you get top notch quality without the snootiness. You can get there in a suit, or in sweats, it won't matter because everyone is there for one reason: hearty, meaty, and delicious cuisine du terroir. The staff knows the food inside out as if they've cooked everything themselves.1. Smoked trout 26$2. Duck terrine 17$3. Large pulled pork with butternut squash gnocchis (regular 27$ large 40.50$) 4. Roasted Fowl 66$5. Side of bone marrow 16$6. Order of fries with parmesan flakes 8$7. Pear pie with housemade Pear and clove ice cream 16$+ 2 bottles of wine (white 65$ and red 65$)+ 3 coffees (3$ each)Everything above was shared. With tax and a 15% tip our total was 435$. For me, the pulled pork stole the show,  it's as if the meat just melted in your mouth, it was so tender. And the ice cream I would buy by the gallon if I could.It's been a while since I wrote a review but I've been busy enjoying life.  Anyways, here goes a review of a highly recommended restaurant I went in Montreal earlier this month.  I came with a friend I haven't seen since college so needless to say, there was a lot we had to catch up on.The setting is quite intimate but it didn't hinder a good conversation.  What we didn't like was the menu.  It is a blackboard hung up high in the wall and written in French only.  The handwriting was like a doctor's prescription and the blackboard was not properly erased so it made reading the menu immensely difficult (not to mention I didn't bring my glasses or read French).I thought the service was ok.  My friend thought our server was a little pretentious.  Anyhow, at least they offered to sell me a half portion of their famous lobster spaghetti.  That allowed me to enjoy some oysters and Canadian sea urchin (uni) as appetizer.  It would be too much food otherwise.  Taste-wise, everything was on par and predictable.It is a pricey place so do save it for a special occasion.  Reservation necessary.As I watched our cheerful server patiently (and entertainingly) translate the French-language menu in its entirety, I was at first dubious, then astonished, and finally delighted.  It was a glimpse into the workings of an establishment of humble origins that has gained acclaim as one of Canada's premier restaurants.The service here is genuinely welcoming.  I am reminded of the graciousness that defines hospitality at a Danny Meyer restaurant.  Without hovering, our servers were there when needed.  From a fine wine list dominated by bottles in the triple digits, our server swiftly ascertained our preference for a lower end choice, then narrowed down a flavor profile in just a brief, bantering exchange.  It was near worth ordering a second bottle for.An argument can be made for two bottles.  Although renowned as a meat-centric restaurant, Joe Beef is equally at ease with seafood, so a sampling of both is reasonable.  One of their more impressive starters were two whole, small trout showered with seasonally fresh vegetables.  The tender meat is gently smoked, yielding a flavor that is surprisingly restrained: enough to accent, not enough to dominate.  Shellfish shined in an equally wonderful sausage of lobster and clams; plump, juicy, and brimming with the flavors of its ingredients.  If the starter menu isn't enough, a few quality, local raw bar options are offered.  Raw oysters are de rigueur, but more interesting was a fresh uni prepared in a light tomato sauce and served in its shell, or the sweet snow crab legs.Of course, it would be sinful to eschew meat at Joe Beef, which offers up a few sharable beef entrees, along with foie gras, Canadian smoked meat, duck, rabbit, horse, lamb, and chicken dishes.  Foie gras parfait is flawless; creamy and luxurious, perfectly offset by a bite of crisp, sharp radish on warm, crusty brioche.  The same brioche is molded like a nest around smooth horse tartare, although robust seasoning muffled the sweetness of raw horse.  Simple, expertly cooked duck breast was a marvel of flavor and succulence.It is easy to see how this utterly charming restaurant is as famed as it is.  It is not for a specific dish, gimmick, or personality.  With its constantly changing menu penned only on chalkboard, Joe Beef announces its allegiance to local, seasonal foods, and prepares them exceptionally well.  Add to that the warmth of the staff and a uniquely home-like atmosphere between its cozy, tavern-like space inside and a festive outdoor area reminiscent of a patio.  It makes for a highly enjoyable, low-key dining experience that seems effortless in execution yet must surely be anything but.  And it will have one thinking about a return visit as soon as possible.I LOVED our waitress!

The fries were cute in a mini Creuset but pretty standard in terms of taste. Cons: 1. Menu is only in French and on the blackboard. Being fully bilingual, I didn't mind at all that the menu was in French. More importantly, I just don't think it is practical to have the only version of the menu on the single blackboard that half the restaurant has their back up against. The ONLY thing that partially made up for it was the detail-oriented servers who could cater to individual questions. It just seemed like a bit of a drag for the server to repeat the menu so many times. 2. In terms of value, sad to say that Joe Beef didn't live up to the hype this time. I'm all about paying good money for dinner but we both agreed that the meal just didn't live up to the long wait for reservations and the price.To try next time: - Lobster spaghetti - Rib steak for 2Lives up to the hype. Other than my appetizer being a little over seasoned (fresh pasta with venison), I only have good things to say. Our waitress did an excellent job guiding us through a somewhat cryptic menu on the chalk board and the end result was a memorable three course dinner. The next time a friend from out of town asks me where they should eat when they come to Montreal, I'll probably tell them to go to Joe Beef.Oh my God, Yumm!My Buddy had been frothing at the mouth to come up to Montreal and try this spot. Wouldn't stop talking about it, ha ha.So we did.We started with the Horse Tar Tar, and tell you the truth, with enough of it, that could have been my meal, it was soooooo goooooood!He had the steak, I had the lamb.  The lamb was good, not great.  His steak was to die for. For sure I will be back and have the steak.Tip: the servers in Canada are quite honest about what's good and tasty on the menu, so if they suggest anything, go for it! We almost balked at the horse tar tar, and it ended up being other-wordly!A good restaurant, but not a great one at the time of my visit.We were able to squeeze in a reservation for two at the bar, and were very excited given all the hype this restaurant has. But it just didn't meet those expectations for me. We each had a glass of wine, then followed with the local buffalo mozzarella appetizer which came with 2 slivers of fish and 2 slices of rye toast. The cheese was lovely, but nothing to write home about; it's fresh mozzarella? Next we had the smoked meat croquettes which were really good, easily the highlight of the meal -- it's everything you love about smoked meat squished up into a little tater-tot sized bite with a pickle on top. For entrees, we split the gentleman's steak with bleu cheese and while it was extremely well cooked (rare) it was really pricey for what amounted to a properly cooked steak with a scoop of garlic spinach on the side. However the portion is huge, so if you split it between two it's actually pretty reasonable. For dessert we had the strawberry and pistachio gratin, which was hyped up a lot by the bar staff. The berries were too early to be flavorful so they macerated them in sugar to increase the flavor. The creamy pistachio flan was amazing though! In all, it was a meal with highs (pistachio flan in the strawberry dessert & smoked meat croquettes) and okay points. For a restaurant of it's reputation, we expected more. The ambiance is great, the staff is helpful, but if you're and english speaker you're out of luck -- the menu is in french and only written on one chalkboard. Thankfully I speak french and was able to get by, but I can see how it's hard for others.Great place, note that the menu is 100% in French.One of the single best meals I've ever had. I know it either had to be amazing or grossly overrated as we made reservations 2.5 months in advance and could only score a table at 10PM on a Thursday evening. Needless to say, I had very high expectations for Joe Beef and JB graciously blew those expectations out of the water. The whole menu is in French on a chalkboard on the wall. Luckily, I picked up some French in High School and College and was able to navigate our nosh options well enough. If French wasn't your thang in school then the waiters will give ya a hand with the translation. We also did our homework and mostly knew what we wanted. The goods: We ordered some of the house pickles along with some of their housemade sourdough with butter which were a delicious beginning to the meal. Next was the sliced ham with mushrooms. I have to say this was one of the best bites of food I have ever had the pleasure of consuming. The ham was so wonderfully soft and fresh. The mushrooms were exploding with flavor and then there was a drizzle of a light cream sauce over top. This dish was absolutely divine. Next came the Lobster Spaghetti. If you think you're too old for spaghetti, get over it and order this right now! GIant chunks of lobster + claws served in a heavy cream sauce with over spaghetti. It was so heavy, but worth every artery clogging bite!For dessert we ordered a Strawberry dish that was absolutely incredible. The Strawberries are shipped down from a farm just north of Montreal and they were so amazingly tart, tangy, and fresh. It made me feel as if I had never tasted a strawberry before and I was tasting them for the first time. Yes, sounds exaggerated but it was that good! Our waiter Patrick was absolutely wonderful! He was great on offering suggestions (we asked him to suggest the appetizer for us). He was hysterical, kind, and super quirky.   Perfect meal in the heart of Little Burgundy.Come here prepared to for meat and calorie overload!  But it is exceptionally good and the service was remarkable.  Very simply if you're traveling to the Montreal area you have to go to Joe Beef.  Oh, but plan ahead, they were booked 2 months in advance. I just got lucky with getting a last minute seat at the bar.This place is amazing.  It epitomizes everything you would want in a restaurant named Joe Beef and combines it with impeccable service, awesome attitude and a great ambiance.  Joe Beef isn't a large space (I believe there are two sides) so reservations are a must.  We had a party of 8 reserved into two groups of 4, but the hostess didn't drop a beat when we told her 2 in our party were delayed.  She seated us in an awesome table for 6 but most importantly paired us with one of the best waitresses I've ever had.  She clearly saw that we were tourists, but that's one thing that I loved about Montreal.  Many of the cool places that we went to, they welcome and are friendly to tourists and this place was no different.  It looked like it was full of French Canadians, but you couldn't tell as they effortlessly switched from English to French catering to their customer.  The menu is a revolving one and written only on the chalkboard nightly, so describing the dishes accurately is almost impossible.  Suffice it to say everything was amazing and it was easily one of the best meat-centric meals I've had in my life.  I was in heaven.  We started off with drinks and I never saw a cocktail menu but the waitress was able to order everyone drinks they loved based on just a brief description of base drink preference (ie: gin, vodka, etc.)  The drinks are strong and tasty and while perhaps not as complex as the artisinal cocktails we had at Lab just before, they were good.  I had no idea how much they cost either.  Then we started off with appetizers.  She knew we were familiar with the famous Foie Gras double down but informed us they no longer sold it.  She saw our sad faces and said would order a selection that would make us happy.  Our waitress never pushed any item (ie: their oysters are famous, but we didn't feel like any) and it really was one of the most fun and engaging ordering experiences I've had.  Foie Gras Small Bites - deep fried and filled with tiny bits of foie gras and potato.  Delicious.  This place knows meat, fried, and smoked.Mozzarella served with Toast - fresh mozzarella cheese sliced and served with toast.  A nice change and balance to all the meat.Sunnyside up Duck Eggs with Pomme Frites - I've never had eggs this good and I've sous vide many eggs. This was better.  It was super rich, seasoned perfectly and the fries were amazing.Foie Gras And Ham Sandwich - this was to make up for the double down.  Split 6 ways, we each only got a small bite, but the salty foie gras sauce and milder ham went with the decant biscuit bread with sauce.  Puff Pastry with Smoked Turkey - our waitresses favorite appetizer.  It was good but tasted a bit like turkey with small bread puffs.  Not interesting enough.Minced Duck and Seared Foie Gras - the duck looked like a steak but broke into parts of duck meat.  The seared foie gras on top was delicious and the berry sauce was a perfect contrast.  Venison Sausage - loved it.  Did I say they do meats well?Lobster Spaghetti - another famous dish.  Whole lobster with cream sauce and perfect al dente noodles.  One of my favorites of the night.  Seared Rib Eye Steak - seasoned perfectly, cooked perfectly, finished completely.Horse Meat Filet Mignon - wrapped with bacon and served with potatoes.  This was a novelty as I've never had horse meat.  Cooked perfectly medium rare the meat was delicious and a very different texture than any meat I've had.  Worth trying once.  Deep Fried Cauliflower - covered in cheese but an obligatory vegetable.Lamb Steak - yet another meat, cooked so perfectly and completely different flavor.  Duck Fat Fries - the perfect starch to complement the meat.  We were too full from drink and food for dessert but finished our meal with laughter with the staff learning French phrases, sharing the best spots for food and merriment and finishing with shots on the house.  Our bill wasn't cheap but the final price was less than I guessed.  It also was one of the best meat meals I've had in my life.  I missed Au Pied du Cochon but I don't think I would have wanted to trade away Joe Beef.  Joe Beef accepts credit cards.A pure 5 star rating without a doubt in my mind. We came to Montreal to specifically go to Joe Beef and it was certainly worth it! Rated one of the most difficult places to get a reservation, we booked many moons ahead of time. Upon arrival, we noticed all the menu items were written on a chalk board. Having poor vision, combined with dimmed lighting, I opted to go with the chefs choice for 6 courses.  It relieved us of the stress of deciding what we should share while adding a layer of anticipation and surprise.  Out waiter was terrific as he attended multiple tables with his cat shirt in celebration of National Cat Day.Favorite dishes: bone marrow, calamari stuffed with meat in a red wine mushroom sauce and apple donuts with smoked Gouda.While everything was perfectly cooked, a bit too salty on some of the more savory items.  Just a general preference of mine, but it didn't stop me from eating everything!How many times have I come to Montreal and NOT eaten here???  This place is amazing!!!  Fish of the day for two: perfectly cooked white fish in a butter wine sauce with roe mixed in, served with a side of clams and little potatoes.  Horse filet mignon (unreal), tender, cooked medium rare, it was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  Served with mashed potatoes.  Duck dish topped with a piece of foie gras.  This came with a side of vegetable but I cannot recall at this point.Even the soft serve ice cream was yummy.  A refreshing end to a most decadent meal.  Everything was fantastic.  I would come back here in an instant.  I would recommend it to everyone!I loved everything about this restaurant.  The food, the service... it was the highlight of my weekend!This place is exceptionally good!Geez- I don't know where to begin. Our table of four shared about a dozen dishes. The highlights being the Horse Tartare, a pasta with Fois Gras and deer shoulder, the smoked crispy fried trout, and the New York Strip with blue cheese.The cocktails were kinda meh.......... but the service and general experience was all on point.I would visit Joe Beef again in a heartbeat. It's one of the best dining experiences I have had.If I have a Jen K's Top 10 Restaurant List, Joe Beef would definitely be on it. And in fact, I might even able to say My Last Meal on Earth I want to have it here. (Yelp's profile question and they do serves uni!)I have been to Liverpool House, Joe Beef's sister restaurant right next door but Joe Beef is the real deal.The menu is seasonal but interesting. A mixture of seafood and meat and even vegetables. And of course foie gras!Everything we ordered were amazing. And the wait staff is just so knowledgeable with the menu and able to make awesome recommendations.The vibe is relaxing especially out on the back patio on a nice summer evening. And of these for a reasonable price! Just make sure you make a reservation ASAP, Joe Beef is just so popular and definitely worth all the hype!Joe Beef is really freakin' good.  It's been about 2 months since I've eaten there while vacationing in Montreal and I still think fondly back on it.The menu rotates pretty often - but for what it's worth - we grabbed the whole flounder with lobster bisque gravy (came with a side of mussels and lobster cream sauced veggies), slow-cooked lamb neck with sausage, seared scallops and foie gras parfait.Other than the scallops (which was fresh and perfectly cooked, but definitely hard to break the mold), everything else was exceptional.  The weirdest thing was the foie gras parfait - which was raw foie gras whipped with egg yolks and paired with tart (rather than sweet) cherries and cherry jam.  It was very strange (seriously, foie for a 'dessert' appetizer) but it worked.  It came in a big bowl so whatever we didn't have on the bread was added as a topping to everything else.  I wish the lamb neck was a bit gamier, but still excellent.  Finally, the flounder was spectacular.Service was excellent.  We were immediately seated after confirming our reservation (if you are planning a trip - do make reservations well in advance).  The service was atypical - friendly but very relaxed.  The menu board is extremely difficult for non-French speakers to read due to the dim lights.  Our waiter just told us he recommended 'everything' but was very knowledgeable, answered all our questions and gauged our appetites well as he told us to stop ordering as he was confident we had 'more than enough' food and he was right.  He really steered us to configure an optimal meal that satisfied everyone at the table considering some unique dietary restrictions.Also, the meal was surprisingly affordable.  With everything mentioned and two beers, the bill came to $65 each for the four of us - tax and tip included.Easily the best restaurant I've been to in Canada.Did not live up to the hype for me: *the smoked meat croquettes were little salt bombs and a bit one note for me.  The sliced pickles just added to the sodium.*seemed dingy inside and there were flies in the restaurant, but thought all the knick knacks strewn throughout were nice photo ops*the horse tartare is phenomenal, loved the shaved matsutakes and the brioche, heavenly.  Best red meat tartare I have ever had.  *if you must get the lobster pasta, get the half portion, it was just okay, pasta al dente, the shellfish could have been better, heavy, creamy, could have used more fresh herbs and again, a lot of the same flavor*veal, escargot and bone marrow, impressive looking dish and was more like short rib type meat than a steak-just falls apart.  Very good and very rich.  Tip: take a photo of the chalkboard and read the menu from your device.  Everyone was struggling and craning their necks.  It's been rather warm the last week, no AC at JB.  Loved our little window nook booth, but I think the garden would have been a great alternative.Reasonable pricing $160 CAD for 4 items, 2 glasses of wine, tax and tip.  We were stuffed.  Great servers and interesting meal, but my least favorite planned meal of the trip.This is my second favorite restaurant in Montreal, ranked only below it's sister restaurant, Liverpool House. Before I get into my review, first, a confession. I came here, too, because of Anthony Bordain. I am not proud of it, I wish I was a cool-kid Montreal-er, but alas I am merely a uni-lingual American.  In fact, my boyfriend and I designed a whole vacation around getting a reservation at Joe Beef. The atmosphere: Joe Beef is simultaneously sexy and casual. It has dark mood lighting, but hockey memorabilia decor. They play Neil Young and French singers I do not recognize. Your plates and glasses are mismatched, and appear to come from a cool thrift store. The bar is boisterous-  ladies cackling, men singing, loud debates amounting, etc. ( an example from our dinner: whether Americans are bigger prudes than Canadians). The staff are irreverent and knowledgeable. Almost all of them seem to have a gleam of mischievous in their eyes. The Food: I ordered some sort of lamb sausage plate, the cocktail of the day (x3), and PEI oysters. My other half ordered the pheasant and wine. We were both very happy. If I had to describe the food, I'd say it was decedent,and intense. My lamb dish was so huge, it presented like a dare. It wasn't prepared like your usual lamb, in that it was not Mediterranean inspired. It actually reminded me a lot of the food I ate in Prague - made to keep you full and warm. It had a dark aroma - of spices I did not recognize but enjoyed. The Oysters were meaty and briny, and served with a very spicy homemade hot sauce. The star of our night was desert, Marjolaine (a painstaking, many-layered chocolate and hazelnut cake). It was the best desert I've ever had in my life. For those Anthony Bordain fans morjolaine was featured in the No Reservations, Quebec episode. There is also a recipe for it in Joe Beef's cookbook. Anyways, making a pilgrimage to Joe Beef should definitely be on any foodie's vacation itinerary. The food, atmosphere, and service were wonderful. I felt right at home in my comfy booth, tearing through animal parts and slogging beer.Food 5 / 5 decor 5 / 5 service 5 / 5 We were 4, made reservations 2 months prior. Everything about the experience was perfection, one of the best part of joe beef is that you get top notch quality without the snootiness. You can get there in a suit, or in sweats, it won't matter because everyone is there for one reason: hearty, meaty, and delicious cuisine du terroir. The staff knows the food inside out as if they've cooked everything themselves.1. Smoked trout 26$2. Duck terrine 17$3. Large pulled pork with butternut squash gnocchis (regular 27$ large 40.50$) 4. Roasted Fowl 66$5. Side of bone marrow 16$6. Order of fries with parmesan flakes 8$7. Pear pie with housemade Pear and clove ice cream 16$+ 2 bottles of wine (white 65$ and red 65$)+ 3 coffees (3$ each)Everything above was shared. With tax and a 15% tip our total was 435$. For me, the pulled pork stole the show,  it's as if the meat just melted in your mouth, it was so tender. And the ice cream I would buy by the gallon if I could.It's been a while since I wrote a review but I've been busy enjoying life.  Anyways, here goes a review of a highly recommended restaurant I went in Montreal earlier this month.  I came with a friend I haven't seen since college so needless to say, there was a lot we had to catch up on.The setting is quite intimate but it didn't hinder a good conversation.  What we didn't like was the menu.  It is a blackboard hung up high in the wall and written in French only.  The handwriting was like a doctor's prescription and the blackboard was not properly erased so it made reading the menu immensely difficult (not to mention I didn't bring my glasses or read French).I thought the service was ok.  My friend thought our server was a little pretentious.  Anyhow, at least they offered to sell me a half portion of their famous lobster spaghetti.  That allowed me to enjoy some oysters and Canadian sea urchin (uni) as appetizer.  It would be too much food otherwise.  Taste-wise, everything was on par and predictable.It is a pricey place so do save it for a special occasion.  Reservation necessary.As I watched our cheerful server patiently (and entertainingly) translate the French-language menu in its entirety, I was at first dubious, then astonished, and finally delighted.  It was a glimpse into the workings of an establishment of humble origins that has gained acclaim as one of Canada's premier restaurants.The service here is genuinely welcoming.  I am reminded of the graciousness that defines hospitality at a Danny Meyer restaurant.  Without hovering, our servers were there when needed.  From a fine wine list dominated by bottles in the triple digits, our server swiftly ascertained our preference for a lower end choice, then narrowed down a flavor profile in just a brief, bantering exchange.  It was near worth ordering a second bottle for.An argument can be made for two bottles.  Although renowned as a meat-centric restaurant, Joe Beef is equally at ease with seafood, so a sampling of both is reasonable.  One of their more impressive starters were two whole, small trout showered with seasonally fresh vegetables.  The tender meat is gently smoked, yielding a flavor that is surprisingly restrained: enough to accent, not enough to dominate.  Shellfish shined in an equally wonderful sausage of lobster and clams; plump, juicy, and brimming with the flavors of its ingredients.  If the starter menu isn't enough, a few quality, local raw bar options are offered.  Raw oysters are de rigueur, but more interesting was a fresh uni prepared in a light tomato sauce and served in its shell, or the sweet snow crab legs.Of course, it would be sinful to eschew meat at Joe Beef, which offers up a few sharable beef entrees, along with foie gras, Canadian smoked meat, duck, rabbit, horse, lamb, and chicken dishes.  Foie gras parfait is flawless; creamy and luxurious, perfectly offset by a bite of crisp, sharp radish on warm, crusty brioche.  The same brioche is molded like a nest around smooth horse tartare, although robust seasoning muffled the sweetness of raw horse.  Simple, expertly cooked duck breast was a marvel of flavor and succulence.It is easy to see how this utterly charming restaurant is as famed as it is.  It is not for a specific dish, gimmick, or personality.  With its constantly changing menu penned only on chalkboard, Joe Beef announces its allegiance to local, seasonal foods, and prepares them exceptionally well.  Add to that the warmth of the staff and a uniquely home-like atmosphere between its cozy, tavern-like space inside and a festive outdoor area reminiscent of a patio.  It makes for a highly enjoyable, low-key dining experience that seems effortless in execution yet must surely be anything but.  And it will have one thinking about a return visit as soon as possible.I LOVED our waitress! She was so friendly and down-to-earth. - I made my reservations 3 months in advance (that's the earliest you can make it) - It's a dimly-lit, tiny restaurant, very homey and intimate - They played some great music while we were there (biggie smalls and some frenchy music)- The menu is written on the chalkboard (behind people sitting in the restaurant) - just take a picture with your smart phone and look at the menu from your seat instead of cranking your neck around and struggling to read it - The waitress encourages you to get up from your seat to look at the menu and she can answer any questions or give you recommendations - Duck for 2 ($90) is HUGE and worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It comes with 2 pieces of foie gras and a duck leg (confit), and like a whole freakin duck. It was SO good. We couldn't finish and I was really sad. HUGE portions. - Corn chowder was delicious too - For dessert, I picked ice cream with concord grapes - it was very good. - I also got to pick at my neighbor's cake (we became friends after sitting so close for 2 hours) - 12 layers of buttercream As with any other French restaurants in Montreal, your meal will probably last 2 hours or longer.We were able to get a last minute reservation here the day of for 9ish. We thought we had lucked out. In some ways we did, in some ways we didn't.  It was a great meal but it was crazy expensive. I was under the impression that this place was small but it has expanded to a full rowhouse so capacity was not a problem. Couples shuffled in and out and there were 1 or 2 empty tables near us the entire time. It was kind of cramped as we were crammed in there. We were seated at a 2 top between 2 couples in the back. Our server was lovely and gave us great choices. It was so dark in there and the writing on the board is so narrow and squiggly there is no way you can see the board so you are completely at the server's mercy when it comes to food and wine choices. The choices she gave us was excellent tho but the prices were tremendously inflated. We got a CAD $110 bottle of wine which I found out on the internet was really a USD $38 bottle of wine so I guess it was the standard markup. We had a Great froie gras appetizer and I had the blue cheese rabbit while hubby had a steak that came overcooked. The server asked him about it and he said it was ok but she took the liberty of sending it back and giving him a rare one instead. I didn't know this at the time but for the prices we were about to pay, it was par for the course. His new steak took a while to come. So 2 bottles of wine, 1 appetizer and 2 main courses, 1 salad and a fruit dessert set us back  400 CAD.  It was about 14 CAD for a side salad add on and similar for a berries dessert with cream. They did give us a small complimentary tasting of another wine for the steak mishap. So...it was good but I'm not sure if it was $400 good. I LOVE French Canadian food and have eaten my way through Quebec City on two occasions not having paid nearly as much in a couple of days than what we did tonight. To make myself feel better, I just looked up the exchange rate so the meal was about 300 USD which sits a lot better in my stomach. Still, Joe Beef is kind of overrated but I'm glad we did it. If we were to come back, I'd definitely only have 1 bottle of wine, and skip the expensive extras like dessert and salad.After an anxious six week wait, the night finally came for dinner at Joe Beef! Pros:1. Service is impeccable. All of the staff is very knowledgeable, in-tune with the menu and attentive to allergies. They checked back at just the right frequency. No complaints at all here. 2. Food is definitely above average. Snow crab legs were incredible -- As our server said, they are in season right now so they were very sweet and didn't even need condiments. The lamb sausage was a tad too salty in my opinion and could have used more starch or veggie on the side to balance that out. The strip steak was flavourful but a little more tough than expected. The fries were cute in a mini Creuset but pretty standard in terms of taste. Cons: 1. Menu is only in French and on the blackboard. Being fully bilingual, I didn't mind at all that the menu was in French. More importantly, I just don't think it is practical to have the only version of the menu on the single blackboard that half the restaurant has their back up against. The ONLY thing that partially made up for it was the detail-oriented servers who could cater to individual questions. It just seemed like a bit of a drag for the server to repeat the menu so many times. 2. In terms of value, sad to say that Joe Beef didn't live up to the hype this time. I'm all about paying good money for dinner but we both agreed that the meal just didn't live up to the long wait for reservations and the price.To try next time: - Lobster spaghetti - Rib steak for 2Lives up to the hype. Other than my appetizer being a little over seasoned (fresh pasta with venison), I only have good things to say. Our waitress did an excellent job guiding us through a somewhat cryptic menu on the chalk board and the end result was a memorable three course dinner.

I just got lucky with getting a last minute seat at the bar.This place is amazing.  It epitomizes everything you would want in a restaurant named Joe Beef and combines it with impeccable service, awesome attitude and a great ambiance.  Joe Beef isn't a large space (I believe there are two sides) so reservations are a must.  We had a party of 8 reserved into two groups of 4, but the hostess didn't drop a beat when we told her 2 in our party were delayed.  She seated us in an awesome table for 6 but most importantly paired us with one of the best waitresses I've ever had.  She clearly saw that we were tourists, but that's one thing that I loved about Montreal.  Many of the cool places that we went to, they welcome and are friendly to tourists and this place was no different.  It looked like it was full of French Canadians, but you couldn't tell as they effortlessly switched from English to French catering to their customer.  The menu is a revolving one and written only on the chalkboard nightly, so describing the dishes accurately is almost impossible.  Suffice it to say everything was amazing and it was easily one of the best meat-centric meals I've had in my life.  I was in heaven.  We started off with drinks and I never saw a cocktail menu but the waitress was able to order everyone drinks they loved based on just a brief description of base drink preference (ie: gin, vodka, etc.)  The drinks are strong and tasty and while perhaps not as complex as the artisinal cocktails we had at Lab just before, they were good.  I had no idea how much they cost either.  Then we started off with appetizers.  She knew we were familiar with the famous Foie Gras double down but informed us they no longer sold it.  She saw our sad faces and said would order a selection that would make us happy.  Our waitress never pushed any item (ie: their oysters are famous, but we didn't feel like any) and it really was one of the most fun and engaging ordering experiences I've had.  Foie Gras Small Bites - deep fried and filled with tiny bits of foie gras and potato.  Delicious.  This place knows meat, fried, and smoked.Mozzarella served with Toast - fresh mozzarella cheese sliced and served with toast.  A nice change and balance to all the meat.Sunnyside up Duck Eggs with Pomme Frites - I've never had eggs this good and I've sous vide many eggs. This was better.  It was super rich, seasoned perfectly and the fries were amazing.Foie Gras And Ham Sandwich - this was to make up for the double down.  Split 6 ways, we each only got a small bite, but the salty foie gras sauce and milder ham went with the decant biscuit bread with sauce.  Puff Pastry with Smoked Turkey - our waitresses favorite appetizer.  It was good but tasted a bit like turkey with small bread puffs.  Not interesting enough.Minced Duck and Seared Foie Gras - the duck looked like a steak but broke into parts of duck meat.  The seared foie gras on top was delicious and the berry sauce was a perfect contrast.  Venison Sausage - loved it.  Did I say they do meats well?Lobster Spaghetti - another famous dish.  Whole lobster with cream sauce and perfect al dente noodles.  One of my favorites of the night.  Seared Rib Eye Steak - seasoned perfectly, cooked perfectly, finished completely.Horse Meat Filet Mignon - wrapped with bacon and served with potatoes.  This was a novelty as I've never had horse meat.  Cooked perfectly medium rare the meat was delicious and a very different texture than any meat I've had.  Worth trying once.  Deep Fried Cauliflower - covered in cheese but an obligatory vegetable.Lamb Steak - yet another meat, cooked so perfectly and completely different flavor.  Duck Fat Fries - the perfect starch to complement the meat.  We were too full from drink and food for dessert but finished our meal with laughter with the staff learning French phrases, sharing the best spots for food and merriment and finishing with shots on the house.  Our bill wasn't cheap but the final price was less than I guessed.  It also was one of the best meat meals I've had in my life.  I missed Au Pied du Cochon but I don't think I would have wanted to trade away Joe Beef.  Joe Beef accepts credit cards.A pure 5 star rating without a doubt in my mind. We came to Montreal to specifically go to Joe Beef and it was certainly worth it! Rated one of the most difficult places to get a reservation, we booked many moons ahead of time. Upon arrival, we noticed all the menu items were written on a chalk board. Having poor vision, combined with dimmed lighting, I opted to go with the chefs choice for 6 courses.  It relieved us of the stress of deciding what we should share while adding a layer of anticipation and surprise.  Out waiter was terrific as he attended multiple tables with his cat shirt in celebration of National Cat Day.Favorite dishes: bone marrow, calamari stuffed with meat in a red wine mushroom sauce and apple donuts with smoked Gouda.While everything was perfectly cooked, a bit too salty on some of the more savory items.  Just a general preference of mine, but it didn't stop me from eating everything!How many times have I come to Montreal and NOT eaten here???  This place is amazing!!!  Fish of the day for two: perfectly cooked white fish in a butter wine sauce with roe mixed in, served with a side of clams and little potatoes.  Horse filet mignon (unreal), tender, cooked medium rare, it was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  Served with mashed potatoes.  Duck dish topped with a piece of foie gras.  This came with a side of vegetable but I cannot recall at this point.Even the soft serve ice cream was yummy.  A refreshing end to a most decadent meal.  Everything was fantastic.  I would come back here in an instant.  I would recommend it to everyone!I loved everything about this restaurant.  The food, the service... it was the highlight of my weekend!This place is exceptionally good!Geez- I don't know where to begin. Our table of four shared about a dozen dishes. The highlights being the Horse Tartare, a pasta with Fois Gras and deer shoulder, the smoked crispy fried trout, and the New York Strip with blue cheese.The cocktails were kinda meh.......... but the service and general experience was all on point.I would visit Joe Beef again in a heartbeat. It's one of the best dining experiences I have had.If I have a Jen K's Top 10 Restaurant List, Joe Beef would definitely be on it. And in fact, I might even able to say My Last Meal on Earth I want to have it here. (Yelp's profile question and they do serves uni!)I have been to Liverpool House, Joe Beef's sister restaurant right next door but Joe Beef is the real deal.The menu is seasonal but interesting. A mixture of seafood and meat and even vegetables. And of course foie gras!Everything we ordered were amazing. And the wait staff is just so knowledgeable with the menu and able to make awesome recommendations.The vibe is relaxing especially out on the back patio on a nice summer evening. And of these for a reasonable price! Just make sure you make a reservation ASAP, Joe Beef is just so popular and definitely worth all the hype!Joe Beef is really freakin' good.  It's been about 2 months since I've eaten there while vacationing in Montreal and I still think fondly back on it.The menu rotates pretty often - but for what it's worth - we grabbed the whole flounder with lobster bisque gravy (came with a side of mussels and lobster cream sauced veggies), slow-cooked lamb neck with sausage, seared scallops and foie gras parfait.Other than the scallops (which was fresh and perfectly cooked, but definitely hard to break the mold), everything else was exceptional.  The weirdest thing was the foie gras parfait - which was raw foie gras whipped with egg yolks and paired with tart (rather than sweet) cherries and cherry jam.  It was very strange (seriously, foie for a 'dessert' appetizer) but it worked.  It came in a big bowl so whatever we didn't have on the bread was added as a topping to everything else.  I wish the lamb neck was a bit gamier, but still excellent.  Finally, the flounder was spectacular.Service was excellent.  We were immediately seated after confirming our reservation (if you are planning a trip - do make reservations well in advance).  The service was atypical - friendly but very relaxed.  The menu board is extremely difficult for non-French speakers to read due to the dim lights.  Our waiter just told us he recommended 'everything' but was very knowledgeable, answered all our questions and gauged our appetites well as he told us to stop ordering as he was confident we had 'more than enough' food and he was right.  He really steered us to configure an optimal meal that satisfied everyone at the table considering some unique dietary restrictions.Also, the meal was surprisingly affordable.  With everything mentioned and two beers, the bill came to $65 each for the four of us - tax and tip included.Easily the best restaurant I've been to in Canada.Did not live up to the hype for me: *the smoked meat croquettes were little salt bombs and a bit one note for me.  The sliced pickles just added to the sodium.*seemed dingy inside and there were flies in the restaurant, but thought all the knick knacks strewn throughout were nice photo ops*the horse tartare is phenomenal, loved the shaved matsutakes and the brioche, heavenly.  Best red meat tartare I have ever had.  *if you must get the lobster pasta, get the half portion, it was just okay, pasta al dente, the shellfish could have been better, heavy, creamy, could have used more fresh herbs and again, a lot of the same flavor*veal, escargot and bone marrow, impressive looking dish and was more like short rib type meat than a steak-just falls apart.  Very good and very rich.  Tip: take a photo of the chalkboard and read the menu from your device.  Everyone was struggling and craning their necks.  It's been rather warm the last week, no AC at JB.  Loved our little window nook booth, but I think the garden would have been a great alternative.Reasonable pricing $160 CAD for 4 items, 2 glasses of wine, tax and tip.  We were stuffed.  Great servers and interesting meal, but my least favorite planned meal of the trip.This is my second favorite restaurant in Montreal, ranked only below it's sister restaurant, Liverpool House. Before I get into my review, first, a confession. I came here, too, because of Anthony Bordain. I am not proud of it, I wish I was a cool-kid Montreal-er, but alas I am merely a uni-lingual American.  In fact, my boyfriend and I designed a whole vacation around getting a reservation at Joe Beef. The atmosphere: Joe Beef is simultaneously sexy and casual. It has dark mood lighting, but hockey memorabilia decor. They play Neil Young and French singers I do not recognize. Your plates and glasses are mismatched, and appear to come from a cool thrift store. The bar is boisterous-  ladies cackling, men singing, loud debates amounting, etc. ( an example from our dinner: whether Americans are bigger prudes than Canadians). The staff are irreverent and knowledgeable. Almost all of them seem to have a gleam of mischievous in their eyes. The Food: I ordered some sort of lamb sausage plate, the cocktail of the day (x3), and PEI oysters. My other half ordered the pheasant and wine. We were both very happy. If I had to describe the food, I'd say it was decedent,and intense. My lamb dish was so huge, it presented like a dare. It wasn't prepared like your usual lamb, in that it was not Mediterranean inspired. It actually reminded me a lot of the food I ate in Prague - made to keep you full and warm. It had a dark aroma - of spices I did not recognize but enjoyed. The Oysters were meaty and briny, and served with a very spicy homemade hot sauce. The star of our night was desert, Marjolaine (a painstaking, many-layered chocolate and hazelnut cake). It was the best desert I've ever had in my life. For those Anthony Bordain fans morjolaine was featured in the No Reservations, Quebec episode. There is also a recipe for it in Joe Beef's cookbook. Anyways, making a pilgrimage to Joe Beef should definitely be on any foodie's vacation itinerary. The food, atmosphere, and service were wonderful. I felt right at home in my comfy booth, tearing through animal parts and slogging beer.Food 5 / 5 decor 5 / 5 service 5 / 5 We were 4, made reservations 2 months prior. Everything about the experience was perfection, one of the best part of joe beef is that you get top notch quality without the snootiness. You can get there in a suit, or in sweats, it won't matter because everyone is there for one reason: hearty, meaty, and delicious cuisine du terroir. The staff knows the food inside out as if they've cooked everything themselves.1. Smoked trout 26$2. Duck terrine 17$3. Large pulled pork with butternut squash gnocchis (regular 27$ large 40.50$) 4. Roasted Fowl 66$5. Side of bone marrow 16$6. Order of fries with parmesan flakes 8$7. Pear pie with housemade Pear and clove ice cream 16$+ 2 bottles of wine (white 65$ and red 65$)+ 3 coffees (3$ each)Everything above was shared. With tax and a 15% tip our total was 435$. For me, the pulled pork stole the show,  it's as if the meat just melted in your mouth, it was so tender. And the ice cream I would buy by the gallon if I could.It's been a while since I wrote a review but I've been busy enjoying life.  Anyways, here goes a review of a highly recommended restaurant I went in Montreal earlier this month.  I came with a friend I haven't seen since college so needless to say, there was a lot we had to catch up on.The setting is quite intimate but it didn't hinder a good conversation.  What we didn't like was the menu.  It is a blackboard hung up high in the wall and written in French only.  The handwriting was like a doctor's prescription and the blackboard was not properly erased so it made reading the menu immensely difficult (not to mention I didn't bring my glasses or read French).I thought the service was ok.  My friend thought our server was a little pretentious.  Anyhow, at least they offered to sell me a half portion of their famous lobster spaghetti.  That allowed me to enjoy some oysters and Canadian sea urchin (uni) as appetizer.  It would be too much food otherwise.  Taste-wise, everything was on par and predictable.It is a pricey place so do save it for a special occasion.  Reservation necessary.As I watched our cheerful server patiently (and entertainingly) translate the French-language menu in its entirety, I was at first dubious, then astonished, and finally delighted.  It was a glimpse into the workings of an establishment of humble origins that has gained acclaim as one of Canada's premier restaurants.The service here is genuinely welcoming.  I am reminded of the graciousness that defines hospitality at a Danny Meyer restaurant.  Without hovering, our servers were there when needed.  From a fine wine list dominated by bottles in the triple digits, our server swiftly ascertained our preference for a lower end choice, then narrowed down a flavor profile in just a brief, bantering exchange.  It was near worth ordering a second bottle for.An argument can be made for two bottles.  Although renowned as a meat-centric restaurant, Joe Beef is equally at ease with seafood, so a sampling of both is reasonable.  One of their more impressive starters were two whole, small trout showered with seasonally fresh vegetables.  The tender meat is gently smoked, yielding a flavor that is surprisingly restrained: enough to accent, not enough to dominate.  Shellfish shined in an equally wonderful sausage of lobster and clams; plump, juicy, and brimming with the flavors of its ingredients.  If the starter menu isn't enough, a few quality, local raw bar options are offered.  Raw oysters are de rigueur, but more interesting was a fresh uni prepared in a light tomato sauce and served in its shell, or the sweet snow crab legs.Of course, it would be sinful to eschew meat at Joe Beef, which offers up a few sharable beef entrees, along with foie gras, Canadian smoked meat, duck, rabbit, horse, lamb, and chicken dishes.  Foie gras parfait is flawless; creamy and luxurious, perfectly offset by a bite of crisp, sharp radish on warm, crusty brioche.  The same brioche is molded like a nest around smooth horse tartare, although robust seasoning muffled the sweetness of raw horse.  Simple, expertly cooked duck breast was a marvel of flavor and succulence.It is easy to see how this utterly charming restaurant is as famed as it is.  It is not for a specific dish, gimmick, or personality.  With its constantly changing menu penned only on chalkboard, Joe Beef announces its allegiance to local, seasonal foods, and prepares them exceptionally well.  Add to that the warmth of the staff and a uniquely home-like atmosphere between its cozy, tavern-like space inside and a festive outdoor area reminiscent of a patio.  It makes for a highly enjoyable, low-key dining experience that seems effortless in execution yet must surely be anything but.  And it will have one thinking about a return visit as soon as possible.I LOVED our waitress! She was so friendly and down-to-earth. - I made my reservations 3 months in advance (that's the earliest you can make it) - It's a dimly-lit, tiny restaurant, very homey and intimate - They played some great music while we were there (biggie smalls and some frenchy music)- The menu is written on the chalkboard (behind people sitting in the restaurant) - just take a picture with your smart phone and look at the menu from your seat instead of cranking your neck around and struggling to read it - The waitress encourages you to get up from your seat to look at the menu and she can answer any questions or give you recommendations - Duck for 2 ($90) is HUGE and worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It comes with 2 pieces of foie gras and a duck leg (confit), and like a whole freakin duck. It was SO good. We couldn't finish and I was really sad. HUGE portions. - Corn chowder was delicious too - For dessert, I picked ice cream with concord grapes - it was very good. - I also got to pick at my neighbor's cake (we became friends after sitting so close for 2 hours) - 12 layers of buttercream As with any other French restaurants in Montreal, your meal will probably last 2 hours or longer.We were able to get a last minute reservation here the day of for 9ish. We thought we had lucked out. In some ways we did, in some ways we didn't.  It was a great meal but it was crazy expensive. I was under the impression that this place was small but it has expanded to a full rowhouse so capacity was not a problem. Couples shuffled in and out and there were 1 or 2 empty tables near us the entire time. It was kind of cramped as we were crammed in there. We were seated at a 2 top between 2 couples in the back. Our server was lovely and gave us great choices. It was so dark in there and the writing on the board is so narrow and squiggly there is no way you can see the board so you are completely at the server's mercy when it comes to food and wine choices. The choices she gave us was excellent tho but the prices were tremendously inflated. We got a CAD $110 bottle of wine which I found out on the internet was really a USD $38 bottle of wine so I guess it was the standard markup. We had a Great froie gras appetizer and I had the blue cheese rabbit while hubby had a steak that came overcooked. The server asked him about it and he said it was ok but she took the liberty of sending it back and giving him a rare one instead. I didn't know this at the time but for the prices we were about to pay, it was par for the course. His new steak took a while to come. So 2 bottles of wine, 1 appetizer and 2 main courses, 1 salad and a fruit dessert set us back  400 CAD.  It was about 14 CAD for a side salad add on and similar for a berries dessert with cream. They did give us a small complimentary tasting of another wine for the steak mishap. So...it was good but I'm not sure if it was $400 good. I LOVE French Canadian food and have eaten my way through Quebec City on two occasions not having paid nearly as much in a couple of days than what we did tonight. To make myself feel better, I just looked up the exchange rate so the meal was about 300 USD which sits a lot better in my stomach. Still, Joe Beef is kind of overrated but I'm glad we did it. If we were to come back, I'd definitely only have 1 bottle of wine, and skip the expensive extras like dessert and salad.After an anxious six week wait, the night finally came for dinner at Joe Beef! Pros:1. Service is impeccable. All of the staff is very knowledgeable, in-tune with the menu and attentive to allergies. They checked back at just the right frequency. No complaints at all here. 2. Food is definitely above average. Snow crab legs were incredible -- As our server said, they are in season right now so they were very sweet and didn't even need condiments. The lamb sausage was a tad too salty in my opinion and could have used more starch or veggie on the side to balance that out. The strip steak was flavourful but a little more tough than expected. The fries were cute in a mini Creuset but pretty standard in terms of taste. Cons: 1. Menu is only in French and on the blackboard. Being fully bilingual, I didn't mind at all that the menu was in French. More importantly, I just don't think it is practical to have the only version of the menu on the single blackboard that half the restaurant has their back up against. The ONLY thing that partially made up for it was the detail-oriented servers who could cater to individual questions. It just seemed like a bit of a drag for the server to repeat the menu so many times. 2. In terms of value, sad to say that Joe Beef didn't live up to the hype this time. I'm all about paying good money for dinner but we both agreed that the meal just didn't live up to the long wait for reservations and the price.To try next time: - Lobster spaghetti - Rib steak for 2Lives up to the hype. Other than my appetizer being a little over seasoned (fresh pasta with venison), I only have good things to say. Our waitress did an excellent job guiding us through a somewhat cryptic menu on the chalk board and the end result was a memorable three course dinner. The next time a friend from out of town asks me where they should eat when they come to Montreal, I'll probably tell them to go to Joe Beef.Oh my God, Yumm!My Buddy had been frothing at the mouth to come up to Montreal and try this spot. Wouldn't stop talking about it, ha ha.So we did.We started with the Horse Tar Tar, and tell you the truth, with enough of it, that could have been my meal, it was soooooo goooooood!He had the steak, I had the lamb.  The lamb was good, not great.  His steak was to die for. For sure I will be back and have the steak.Tip: the servers in Canada are quite honest about what's good and tasty on the menu, so if they suggest anything, go for it! We almost balked at the horse tar tar, and it ended up being other-wordly!A good restaurant, but not a great one at the time of my visit.We were able to squeeze in a reservation for two at the bar, and were very excited given all the hype this restaurant has. But it just didn't meet those expectations for me. We each had a glass of wine, then followed with the local buffalo mozzarella appetizer which came with 2 slivers of fish and 2 slices of rye toast. The cheese was lovely, but nothing to write home about; it's fresh mozzarella? Next we had the smoked meat croquettes which were really good, easily the highlight of the meal -- it's everything you love about smoked meat squished up into a little tater-tot sized bite with a pickle on top. For entrees, we split the gentleman's steak with bleu cheese and while it was extremely well cooked (rare) it was really pricey for what amounted to a properly cooked steak with a scoop of garlic spinach on the side. However the portion is huge, so if you split it between two it's actually pretty reasonable. For dessert we had the strawberry and pistachio gratin, which was hyped up a lot by the bar staff. The berries were too early to be flavorful so they macerated them in sugar to increase the flavor. The creamy pistachio flan was amazing though! In all, it was a meal with highs (pistachio flan in the strawberry dessert & smoked meat croquettes) and okay points. For a restaurant of it's reputation, we expected more. The ambiance is great, the staff is helpful, but if you're and english speaker you're out of luck -- the menu is in french and only written on one chalkboard. Thankfully I speak french and was able to get by, but I can see how it's hard for others.Great place, note that the menu is 100% in French.One of the single best meals I've ever had. I know it either had to be amazing or grossly overrated as we made reservations 2.5 months in advance and could only score a table at 10PM on a Thursday evening. Needless to say, I had very high expectations for Joe Beef and JB graciously blew those expectations out of the water. The whole menu is in French on a chalkboard on the wall. Luckily, I picked up some French in High School and College and was able to navigate our nosh options well enough. If French wasn't your thang in school then the waiters will give ya a hand with the translation. We also did our homework and mostly knew what we wanted. The goods: We ordered some of the house pickles along with some of their housemade sourdough with butter which were a delicious beginning to the meal. Next was the sliced ham with mushrooms. I have to say this was one of the best bites of food I have ever had the pleasure of consuming. The ham was so wonderfully soft and fresh. The mushrooms were exploding with flavor and then there was a drizzle of a light cream sauce over top. This dish was absolutely divine. Next came the Lobster Spaghetti. If you think you're too old for spaghetti, get over it and order this right now! GIant chunks of lobster + claws served in a heavy cream sauce with over spaghetti. It was so heavy, but worth every artery clogging bite!For dessert we ordered a Strawberry dish that was absolutely incredible. The Strawberries are shipped down from a farm just north of Montreal and they were so amazingly tart, tangy, and fresh. It made me feel as if I had never tasted a strawberry before and I was tasting them for the first time. Yes, sounds exaggerated but it was that good! Our waiter Patrick was absolutely wonderful! He was great on offering suggestions (we asked him to suggest the appetizer for us). He was hysterical, kind, and super quirky.   Perfect meal in the heart of Little Burgundy.Come here prepared to for meat and calorie overload!  But it is exceptionally good and the service was remarkable.  Very simply if you're traveling to the Montreal area you have to go to Joe Beef.  Oh, but plan ahead, they were booked 2 months in advance.

Just make sure you make a reservation ASAP, Joe Beef is just so popular and definitely worth all the hype!Joe Beef is really freakin' good.  It's been about 2 months since I've eaten there while vacationing in Montreal and I still think fondly back on it.The menu rotates pretty often - but for what it's worth - we grabbed the whole flounder with lobster bisque gravy (came with a side of mussels and lobster cream sauced veggies), slow-cooked lamb neck with sausage, seared scallops and foie gras parfait.Other than the scallops (which was fresh and perfectly cooked, but definitely hard to break the mold), everything else was exceptional.  The weirdest thing was the foie gras parfait - which was raw foie gras whipped with egg yolks and paired with tart (rather than sweet) cherries and cherry jam.  It was very strange (seriously, foie for a 'dessert' appetizer) but it worked.  It came in a big bowl so whatever we didn't have on the bread was added as a topping to everything else.  I wish the lamb neck was a bit gamier, but still excellent.  Finally, the flounder was spectacular.Service was excellent.  We were immediately seated after confirming our reservation (if you are planning a trip - do make reservations well in advance).  The service was atypical - friendly but very relaxed.  The menu board is extremely difficult for non-French speakers to read due to the dim lights.  Our waiter just told us he recommended 'everything' but was very knowledgeable, answered all our questions and gauged our appetites well as he told us to stop ordering as he was confident we had 'more than enough' food and he was right.  He really steered us to configure an optimal meal that satisfied everyone at the table considering some unique dietary restrictions.Also, the meal was surprisingly affordable.  With everything mentioned and two beers, the bill came to $65 each for the four of us - tax and tip included.Easily the best restaurant I've been to in Canada.Did not live up to the hype for me: *the smoked meat croquettes were little salt bombs and a bit one note for me.  The sliced pickles just added to the sodium.*seemed dingy inside and there were flies in the restaurant, but thought all the knick knacks strewn throughout were nice photo ops*the horse tartare is phenomenal, loved the shaved matsutakes and the brioche, heavenly.  Best red meat tartare I have ever had.  *if you must get the lobster pasta, get the half portion, it was just okay, pasta al dente, the shellfish could have been better, heavy, creamy, could have used more fresh herbs and again, a lot of the same flavor*veal, escargot and bone marrow, impressive looking dish and was more like short rib type meat than a steak-just falls apart.  Very good and very rich.  Tip: take a photo of the chalkboard and read the menu from your device.  Everyone was struggling and craning their necks.  It's been rather warm the last week, no AC at JB.  Loved our little window nook booth, but I think the garden would have been a great alternative.Reasonable pricing $160 CAD for 4 items, 2 glasses of wine, tax and tip.  We were stuffed.  Great servers and interesting meal, but my least favorite planned meal of the trip.This is my second favorite restaurant in Montreal, ranked only below it's sister restaurant, Liverpool House. Before I get into my review, first, a confession. I came here, too, because of Anthony Bordain. I am not proud of it, I wish I was a cool-kid Montreal-er, but alas I am merely a uni-lingual American.  In fact, my boyfriend and I designed a whole vacation around getting a reservation at Joe Beef. The atmosphere: Joe Beef is simultaneously sexy and casual. It has dark mood lighting, but hockey memorabilia decor. They play Neil Young and French singers I do not recognize. Your plates and glasses are mismatched, and appear to come from a cool thrift store. The bar is boisterous-  ladies cackling, men singing, loud debates amounting, etc. ( an example from our dinner: whether Americans are bigger prudes than Canadians). The staff are irreverent and knowledgeable. Almost all of them seem to have a gleam of mischievous in their eyes. The Food: I ordered some sort of lamb sausage plate, the cocktail of the day (x3), and PEI oysters. My other half ordered the pheasant and wine. We were both very happy. If I had to describe the food, I'd say it was decedent,and intense. My lamb dish was so huge, it presented like a dare. It wasn't prepared like your usual lamb, in that it was not Mediterranean inspired. It actually reminded me a lot of the food I ate in Prague - made to keep you full and warm. It had a dark aroma - of spices I did not recognize but enjoyed. The Oysters were meaty and briny, and served with a very spicy homemade hot sauce. The star of our night was desert, Marjolaine (a painstaking, many-layered chocolate and hazelnut cake). It was the best desert I've ever had in my life. For those Anthony Bordain fans morjolaine was featured in the No Reservations, Quebec episode. There is also a recipe for it in Joe Beef's cookbook. Anyways, making a pilgrimage to Joe Beef should definitely be on any foodie's vacation itinerary. The food, atmosphere, and service were wonderful. I felt right at home in my comfy booth, tearing through animal parts and slogging beer.Food 5 / 5 decor 5 / 5 service 5 / 5 We were 4, made reservations 2 months prior. Everything about the experience was perfection, one of the best part of joe beef is that you get top notch quality without the snootiness. You can get there in a suit, or in sweats, it won't matter because everyone is there for one reason: hearty, meaty, and delicious cuisine du terroir. The staff knows the food inside out as if they've cooked everything themselves.1. Smoked trout 26$2. Duck terrine 17$3. Large pulled pork with butternut squash gnocchis (regular 27$ large 40.50$) 4.

Pear pie with housemade Pear and clove ice cream 16$+ 2 bottles of wine (white 65$ and red 65$)+ 3 coffees (3$ each)Everything above was shared. With tax and a 15% tip our total was 435$. For me, the pulled pork stole the show,  it's as if the meat just melted in your mouth, it was so tender. And the ice cream I would buy by the gallon if I could.It's been a while since I wrote a review but I've been busy enjoying life.  Anyways, here goes a review of a highly recommended restaurant I went in Montreal earlier this month.  I came with a friend I haven't seen since college so needless to say, there was a lot we had to catch up on.The setting is quite intimate but it didn't hinder a good conversation.  What we didn't like was the menu.  It is a blackboard hung up high in the wall and written in French only.  The handwriting was like a doctor's prescription and the blackboard was not properly erased so it made reading the menu immensely difficult (not to mention I didn't bring my glasses or read French).I thought the service was ok.  My friend thought our server was a little pretentious.  Anyhow, at least they offered to sell me a half portion of their famous lobster spaghetti.  That allowed me to enjoy some oysters and Canadian sea urchin (uni) as appetizer.  It would be too much food otherwise.  Taste-wise, everything was on par and predictable.It is a pricey place so do save it for a special occasion.  Reservation necessary.As I watched our cheerful server patiently (and entertainingly) translate the French-language menu in its entirety, I was at first dubious, then astonished, and finally delighted.  It was a glimpse into the workings of an establishment of humble origins that has gained acclaim as one of Canada's premier restaurants.The service here is genuinely welcoming.  I am reminded of the graciousness that defines hospitality at a Danny Meyer restaurant.  Without hovering, our servers were there when needed.  From a fine wine list dominated by bottles in the triple digits, our server swiftly ascertained our preference for a lower end choice, then narrowed down a flavor profile in just a brief, bantering exchange.  It was near worth ordering a second bottle for.An argument can be made for two bottles.  Although renowned as a meat-centric restaurant, Joe Beef is equally at ease with seafood, so a sampling of both is reasonable.  One of their more impressive starters were two whole, small trout showered with seasonally fresh vegetables.  The tender meat is gently smoked, yielding a flavor that is surprisingly restrained: enough to accent, not enough to dominate.  Shellfish shined in an equally wonderful sausage of lobster and clams; plump, juicy, and brimming with the flavors of its ingredients.  If the starter menu isn't enough, a few quality, local raw bar options are offered.  Raw oysters are de rigueur, but more interesting was a fresh uni prepared in a light tomato sauce and served in its shell, or the sweet snow crab legs.Of course, it would be sinful to eschew meat at Joe Beef, which offers up a few sharable beef entrees, along with foie gras, Canadian smoked meat, duck, rabbit, horse, lamb, and chicken dishes.  Foie gras parfait is flawless; creamy and luxurious, perfectly offset by a bite of crisp, sharp radish on warm, crusty brioche.  The same brioche is molded like a nest around smooth horse tartare, although robust seasoning muffled the sweetness of raw horse.  Simple, expertly cooked duck breast was a marvel of flavor and succulence.It is easy to see how this utterly charming restaurant is as famed as it is.  It is not for a specific dish, gimmick, or personality.  With its constantly changing menu penned only on chalkboard, Joe Beef announces its allegiance to local, seasonal foods, and prepares them exceptionally well.  Add to that the warmth of the staff and a uniquely home-like atmosphere between its cozy, tavern-like space inside and a festive outdoor area reminiscent of a patio.  It makes for a highly enjoyable, low-key dining experience that seems effortless in execution yet must surely be anything but.  And it will have one thinking about a return visit as soon as possible.I LOVED our waitress! She was so friendly and down-to-earth. - I made my reservations 3 months in advance (that's the earliest you can make it) - It's a dimly-lit, tiny restaurant, very homey and intimate - They played some great music while we were there (biggie smalls and some frenchy music)- The menu is written on the chalkboard (behind people sitting in the restaurant) - just take a picture with your smart phone and look at the menu from your seat instead of cranking your neck around and struggling to read it - The waitress encourages you to get up from your seat to look at the menu and she can answer any questions or give you recommendations - Duck for 2 ($90) is HUGE and worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It comes with 2 pieces of foie gras and a duck leg (confit), and like a whole freakin duck. It was SO good. We couldn't finish and I was really sad. HUGE portions. - Corn chowder was delicious too - For dessert, I picked ice cream with concord grapes - it was very good. - I also got to pick at my neighbor's cake (we became friends after sitting so close for 2 hours) - 12 layers of buttercream As with any other French restaurants in Montreal, your meal will probably last 2 hours or longer.We were able to get a last minute reservation here the day of for 9ish. We thought we had lucked out. In some ways we did, in some ways we didn't.  It was a great meal but it was crazy expensive. I was under the impression that this place was small but it has expanded to a full rowhouse so capacity was not a problem. Couples shuffled in and out and there were 1 or 2 empty tables near us the entire time. It was kind of cramped as we were crammed in there. We were seated at a 2 top between 2 couples in the back. Our server was lovely and gave us great choices. It was so dark in there and the writing on the board is so narrow and squiggly there is no way you can see the board so you are completely at the server's mercy when it comes to food and wine choices. The choices she gave us was excellent tho but the prices were tremendously inflated. We got a CAD $110 bottle of wine which I found out on the internet was really a USD $38 bottle of wine so I guess it was the standard markup. We had a Great froie gras appetizer and I had the blue cheese rabbit while hubby had a steak that came overcooked. The server asked him about it and he said it was ok but she took the liberty of sending it back and giving him a rare one instead. I didn't know this at the time but for the prices we were about to pay, it was par for the course. His new steak took a while to come. So 2 bottles of wine, 1 appetizer and 2 main courses, 1 salad and a fruit dessert set us back  400 CAD.  It was about 14 CAD for a side salad add on and similar for a berries dessert with cream. They did give us a small complimentary tasting of another wine for the steak mishap. So...it was good but I'm not sure if it was $400 good. I LOVE French Canadian food and have eaten my way through Quebec City on two occasions not having paid nearly as much in a couple of days than what we did tonight. To make myself feel better, I just looked up the exchange rate so the meal was about 300 USD which sits a lot better in my stomach. Still, Joe Beef is kind of overrated but I'm glad we did it. If we were to come back, I'd definitely only have 1 bottle of wine, and skip the expensive extras like dessert and salad.After an anxious six week wait, the night finally came for dinner at Joe Beef! Pros:1. Service is impeccable. All of the staff is very knowledgeable, in-tune with the menu and attentive to allergies. They checked back at just the right frequency. No complaints at all here. 2. Food is definitely above average. Snow crab legs were incredible -- As our server said, they are in season right now so they were very sweet and didn't even need condiments. The lamb sausage was a tad too salty in my opinion and could have used more starch or veggie on the side to balance that out. The strip steak was flavourful but a little more tough than expected. The fries were cute in a mini Creuset but pretty standard in terms of taste. Cons: 1. Menu is only in French and on the blackboard. Being fully bilingual, I didn't mind at all that the menu was in French. More importantly, I just don't think it is practical to have the only version of the menu on the single blackboard that half the restaurant has their back up against. The ONLY thing that partially made up for it was the detail-oriented servers who could cater to individual questions. It just seemed like a bit of a drag for the server to repeat the menu so many times. 2. In terms of value, sad to say that Joe Beef didn't live up to the hype this time. I'm all about paying good money for dinner but we both agreed that the meal just didn't live up to the long wait for reservations and the price.To try next time: - Lobster spaghetti - Rib steak for 2Lives up to the hype. Other than my appetizer being a little over seasoned (fresh pasta with venison), I only have good things to say. Our waitress did an excellent job guiding us through a somewhat cryptic menu on the chalk board and the end result was a memorable three course dinner. The next time a friend from out of town asks me where they should eat when they come to Montreal, I'll probably tell them to go to Joe Beef.Oh my God, Yumm!My Buddy had been frothing at the mouth to come up to Montreal and try this spot. Wouldn't stop talking about it, ha ha.So we did.We started with the Horse Tar Tar, and tell you the truth, with enough of it, that could have been my meal, it was soooooo goooooood!He had the steak, I had the lamb.  The lamb was good, not great.  His steak was to die for. For sure I will be back and have the steak.Tip: the servers in Canada are quite honest about what's good and tasty on the menu, so if they suggest anything, go for it! We almost balked at the horse tar tar, and it ended up being other-wordly!A good restaurant, but not a great one at the time of my visit.We were able to squeeze in a reservation for two at the bar, and were very excited given all the hype this restaurant has. But it just didn't meet those expectations for me. We each had a glass of wine, then followed with the local buffalo mozzarella appetizer which came with 2 slivers of fish and 2 slices of rye toast. The cheese was lovely, but nothing to write home about; it's fresh mozzarella? Next we had the smoked meat croquettes which were really good, easily the highlight of the meal -- it's everything you love about smoked meat squished up into a little tater-tot sized bite with a pickle on top. For entrees, we split the gentleman's steak with bleu cheese and while it was extremely well cooked (rare) it was really pricey for what amounted to a properly cooked steak with a scoop of garlic spinach on the side. However the portion is huge, so if you split it between two it's actually pretty reasonable. For dessert we had the strawberry and pistachio gratin, which was hyped up a lot by the bar staff. The berries were too early to be flavorful so they macerated them in sugar to increase the flavor. The creamy pistachio flan was amazing though! In all, it was a meal with highs (pistachio flan in the strawberry dessert & smoked meat croquettes) and okay points. For a restaurant of it's reputation, we expected more. The ambiance is great, the staff is helpful, but if you're and english speaker you're out of luck -- the menu is in french and only written on one chalkboard. Thankfully I speak french and was able to get by, but I can see how it's hard for others.Great place, note that the menu is 100% in French.One of the single best meals I've ever had. I know it either had to be amazing or grossly overrated as we made reservations 2.5 months in advance and could only score a table at 10PM on a Thursday evening. Needless to say, I had very high expectations for Joe Beef and JB graciously blew those expectations out of the water. The whole menu is in French on a chalkboard on the wall. Luckily, I picked up some French in High School and College and was able to navigate our nosh options well enough. If French wasn't your thang in school then the waiters will give ya a hand with the translation. We also did our homework and mostly knew what we wanted. The goods: We ordered some of the house pickles along with some of their housemade sourdough with butter which were a delicious beginning to the meal. Next was the sliced ham with mushrooms. I have to say this was one of the best bites of food I have ever had the pleasure of consuming. The ham was so wonderfully soft and fresh. The mushrooms were exploding with flavor and then there was a drizzle of a light cream sauce over top. This dish was absolutely divine. Next came the Lobster Spaghetti. If you think you're too old for spaghetti, get over it and order this right now! GIant chunks of lobster + claws served in a heavy cream sauce with over spaghetti. It was so heavy, but worth every artery clogging bite!For dessert we ordered a Strawberry dish that was absolutely incredible. The Strawberries are shipped down from a farm just north of Montreal and they were so amazingly tart, tangy, and fresh. It made me feel as if I had never tasted a strawberry before and I was tasting them for the first time. Yes, sounds exaggerated but it was that good! Our waiter Patrick was absolutely wonderful! He was great on offering suggestions (we asked him to suggest the appetizer for us). He was hysterical, kind, and super quirky.   Perfect meal in the heart of Little Burgundy.Come here prepared to for meat and calorie overload!  But it is exceptionally good and the service was remarkable.  Very simply if you're traveling to the Montreal area you have to go to Joe Beef.  Oh, but plan ahead, they were booked 2 months in advance. I just got lucky with getting a last minute seat at the bar.This place is amazing.  It epitomizes everything you would want in a restaurant named Joe Beef and combines it with impeccable service, awesome attitude and a great ambiance.  Joe Beef isn't a large space (I believe there are two sides) so reservations are a must.  We had a party of 8 reserved into two groups of 4, but the hostess didn't drop a beat when we told her 2 in our party were delayed.  She seated us in an awesome table for 6 but most importantly paired us with one of the best waitresses I've ever had.  She clearly saw that we were tourists, but that's one thing that I loved about Montreal.  Many of the cool places that we went to, they welcome and are friendly to tourists and this place was no different.  It looked like it was full of French Canadians, but you couldn't tell as they effortlessly switched from English to French catering to their customer.  The menu is a revolving one and written only on the chalkboard nightly, so describing the dishes accurately is almost impossible.  Suffice it to say everything was amazing and it was easily one of the best meat-centric meals I've had in my life.  I was in heaven.  We started off with drinks and I never saw a cocktail menu but the waitress was able to order everyone drinks they loved based on just a brief description of base drink preference (ie: gin, vodka, etc.)  The drinks are strong and tasty and while perhaps not as complex as the artisinal cocktails we had at Lab just before, they were good.  I had no idea how much they cost either.  Then we started off with appetizers.  She knew we were familiar with the famous Foie Gras double down but informed us they no longer sold it.  She saw our sad faces and said would order a selection that would make us happy.  Our waitress never pushed any item (ie: their oysters are famous, but we didn't feel like any) and it really was one of the most fun and engaging ordering experiences I've had.  Foie Gras Small Bites - deep fried and filled with tiny bits of foie gras and potato.  Delicious.  This place knows meat, fried, and smoked.Mozzarella served with Toast - fresh mozzarella cheese sliced and served with toast.  A nice change and balance to all the meat.Sunnyside up Duck Eggs with Pomme Frites - I've never had eggs this good and I've sous vide many eggs. This was better.  It was super rich, seasoned perfectly and the fries were amazing.Foie Gras And Ham Sandwich - this was to make up for the double down.  Split 6 ways, we each only got a small bite, but the salty foie gras sauce and milder ham went with the decant biscuit bread with sauce.  Puff Pastry with Smoked Turkey - our waitresses favorite appetizer.  It was good but tasted a bit like turkey with small bread puffs.  Not interesting enough.Minced Duck and Seared Foie Gras - the duck looked like a steak but broke into parts of duck meat.  The seared foie gras on top was delicious and the berry sauce was a perfect contrast.  Venison Sausage - loved it.  Did I say they do meats well?Lobster Spaghetti - another famous dish.  Whole lobster with cream sauce and perfect al dente noodles.  One of my favorites of the night.  Seared Rib Eye Steak - seasoned perfectly, cooked perfectly, finished completely.Horse Meat Filet Mignon - wrapped with bacon and served with potatoes.  This was a novelty as I've never had horse meat.  Cooked perfectly medium rare the meat was delicious and a very different texture than any meat I've had.  Worth trying once.  Deep Fried Cauliflower - covered in cheese but an obligatory vegetable.Lamb Steak - yet another meat, cooked so perfectly and completely different flavor.  Duck Fat Fries - the perfect starch to complement the meat.  We were too full from drink and food for dessert but finished our meal with laughter with the staff learning French phrases, sharing the best spots for food and merriment and finishing with shots on the house.  Our bill wasn't cheap but the final price was less than I guessed.  It also was one of the best meat meals I've had in my life.  I missed Au Pied du Cochon but I don't think I would have wanted to trade away Joe Beef.  Joe Beef accepts credit cards.A pure 5 star rating without a doubt in my mind. We came to Montreal to specifically go to Joe Beef and it was certainly worth it! Rated one of the most difficult places to get a reservation, we booked many moons ahead of time. Upon arrival, we noticed all the menu items were written on a chalk board. Having poor vision, combined with dimmed lighting, I opted to go with the chefs choice for 6 courses.  It relieved us of the stress of deciding what we should share while adding a layer of anticipation and surprise.  Out waiter was terrific as he attended multiple tables with his cat shirt in celebration of National Cat Day.Favorite dishes: bone marrow, calamari stuffed with meat in a red wine mushroom sauce and apple donuts with smoked Gouda.While everything was perfectly cooked, a bit too salty on some of the more savory items.  Just a general preference of mine, but it didn't stop me from eating everything!How many times have I come to Montreal and NOT eaten here???  This place is amazing!!!  Fish of the day for two: perfectly cooked white fish in a butter wine sauce with roe mixed in, served with a side of clams and little potatoes.  Horse filet mignon (unreal), tender, cooked medium rare, it was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  Served with mashed potatoes.  Duck dish topped with a piece of foie gras.  This came with a side of vegetable but I cannot recall at this point.Even the soft serve ice cream was yummy.  A refreshing end to a most decadent meal.  Everything was fantastic.  I would come back here in an instant.  I would recommend it to everyone!I loved everything about this restaurant.  The food, the service... it was the highlight of my weekend!This place is exceptionally good!Geez- I don't know where to begin. Our table of four shared about a dozen dishes. The highlights being the Horse Tartare, a pasta with Fois Gras and deer shoulder, the smoked crispy fried trout, and the New York Strip with blue cheese.The cocktails were kinda meh.......... but the service and general experience was all on point.I would visit Joe Beef again in a heartbeat. It's one of the best dining experiences I have had.If I have a Jen K's Top 10 Restaurant List, Joe Beef would definitely be on it. And in fact, I might even able to say My Last Meal on Earth I want to have it here. (Yelp's profile question and they do serves uni!)I have been to Liverpool House, Joe Beef's sister restaurant right next door but Joe Beef is the real deal.The menu is seasonal but interesting. A mixture of seafood and meat and even vegetables. And of course foie gras!Everything we ordered were amazing. And the wait staff is just so knowledgeable with the menu and able to make awesome recommendations.The vibe is relaxing especially out on the back patio on a nice summer evening. And of these for a reasonable price! Just make sure you make a reservation ASAP, Joe Beef is just so popular and definitely worth all the hype!Joe Beef is really freakin' good.  It's been about 2 months since I've eaten there while vacationing in Montreal and I still think fondly back on it.The menu rotates pretty often - but for what it's worth - we grabbed the whole flounder with lobster bisque gravy (came with a side of mussels and lobster cream sauced veggies), slow-cooked lamb neck with sausage, seared scallops and foie gras parfait.Other than the scallops (which was fresh and perfectly cooked, but definitely hard to break the mold), everything else was exceptional.  The weirdest thing was the foie gras parfait - which was raw foie gras whipped with egg yolks and paired with tart (rather than sweet) cherries and cherry jam.  It was very strange (seriously, foie for a 'dessert' appetizer) but it worked.  It came in a big bowl so whatever we didn't have on the bread was added as a topping to everything else.  I wish the lamb neck was a bit gamier, but still excellent.  Finally, the flounder was spectacular.Service was excellent.  We were immediately seated after confirming our reservation (if you are planning a trip - do make reservations well in advance).  The service was atypical - friendly but very relaxed.  The menu board is extremely difficult for non-French speakers to read due to the dim lights.  Our waiter just told us he recommended 'everything' but was very knowledgeable, answered all our questions and gauged our appetites well as he told us to stop ordering as he was confident we had 'more than enough' food and he was right.  He really steered us to configure an optimal meal that satisfied everyone at the table considering some unique dietary restrictions.Also, the meal was surprisingly affordable.  With everything mentioned and two beers, the bill came to $65 each for the four of us - tax and tip included.Easily the best restaurant I've been to in Canada.Did not live up to the hype for me: *the smoked meat croquettes were little salt bombs and a bit one note for me.  The sliced pickles just added to the sodium.*seemed dingy inside and there were flies in the restaurant, but thought all the knick knacks strewn throughout were nice photo ops*the horse tartare is phenomenal, loved the shaved matsutakes and the brioche, heavenly.  Best red meat tartare I have ever had.  *if you must get the lobster pasta, get the half portion, it was just okay, pasta al dente, the shellfish could have been better, heavy, creamy, could have used more fresh herbs and again, a lot of the same flavor*veal, escargot and bone marrow, impressive looking dish and was more like short rib type meat than a steak-just falls apart.  Very good and very rich.  Tip: take a photo of the chalkboard and read the menu from your device.  Everyone was struggling and craning their necks.  It's been rather warm the last week, no AC at JB.  Loved our little window nook booth, but I think the garden would have been a great alternative.Reasonable pricing $160 CAD for 4 items, 2 glasses of wine, tax and tip.  We were stuffed.  Great servers and interesting meal, but my least favorite planned meal of the trip.This is my second favorite restaurant in Montreal, ranked only below it's sister restaurant, Liverpool House.

And the ice cream I would buy by the gallon if I could.It's been a while since I wrote a review but I've been busy enjoying life.  Anyways, here goes a review of a highly recommended restaurant I went in Montreal earlier this month.  I came with a friend I haven't seen since college so needless to say, there was a lot we had to catch up on.The setting is quite intimate but it didn't hinder a good conversation.  What we didn't like was the menu.  It is a blackboard hung up high in the wall and written in French only.  The handwriting was like a doctor's prescription and the blackboard was not properly erased so it made reading the menu immensely difficult (not to mention I didn't bring my glasses or read French).I thought the service was ok.  My friend thought our server was a little pretentious.  Anyhow, at least they offered to sell me a half portion of their famous lobster spaghetti.  That allowed me to enjoy some oysters and Canadian sea urchin (uni) as appetizer.  It would be too much food otherwise.  Taste-wise, everything was on par and predictable.It is a pricey place so do save it for a special occasion.  Reservation necessary.As I watched our cheerful server patiently (and entertainingly) translate the French-language menu in its entirety, I was at first dubious, then astonished, and finally delighted.  It was a glimpse into the workings of an establishment of humble origins that has gained acclaim as one of Canada's premier restaurants.The service here is genuinely welcoming.  I am reminded of the graciousness that defines hospitality at a Danny Meyer restaurant.  Without hovering, our servers were there when needed.  From a fine wine list dominated by bottles in the triple digits, our server swiftly ascertained our preference for a lower end choice, then narrowed down a flavor profile in just a brief, bantering exchange.  It was near worth ordering a second bottle for.An argument can be made for two bottles.  Although renowned as a meat-centric restaurant, Joe Beef is equally at ease with seafood, so a sampling of both is reasonable.  One of their more impressive starters were two whole, small trout showered with seasonally fresh vegetables.  The tender meat is gently smoked, yielding a flavor that is surprisingly restrained: enough to accent, not enough to dominate.  Shellfish shined in an equally wonderful sausage of lobster and clams; plump, juicy, and brimming with the flavors of its ingredients.  If the starter menu isn't enough, a few quality, local raw bar options are offered.  Raw oysters are de rigueur, but more interesting was a fresh uni prepared in a light tomato sauce and served in its shell, or the sweet snow crab legs.Of course, it would be sinful to eschew meat at Joe Beef, which offers up a few sharable beef entrees, along with foie gras, Canadian smoked meat, duck, rabbit, horse, lamb, and chicken dishes.  Foie gras parfait is flawless; creamy and luxurious, perfectly offset by a bite of crisp, sharp radish on warm, crusty brioche.  The same brioche is molded like a nest around smooth horse tartare, although robust seasoning muffled the sweetness of raw horse.  Simple, expertly cooked duck breast was a marvel of flavor and succulence.It is easy to see how this utterly charming restaurant is as famed as it is.  It is not for a specific dish, gimmick, or personality.  With its constantly changing menu penned only on chalkboard, Joe Beef announces its allegiance to local, seasonal foods, and prepares them exceptionally well.  Add to that the warmth of the staff and a uniquely home-like atmosphere between its cozy, tavern-like space inside and a festive outdoor area reminiscent of a patio.  It makes for a highly enjoyable, low-key dining experience that seems effortless in execution yet must surely be anything but.  And it will have one thinking about a return visit as soon as possible.I LOVED our waitress! She was so friendly and down-to-earth. - I made my reservations 3 months in advance (that's the earliest you can make it) - It's a dimly-lit, tiny restaurant, very homey and intimate - They played some great music while we were there (biggie smalls and some frenchy music)- The menu is written on the chalkboard (behind people sitting in the restaurant) - just take a picture with your smart phone and look at the menu from your seat instead of cranking your neck around and struggling to read it - The waitress encourages you to get up from your seat to look at the menu and she can answer any questions or give you recommendations - Duck for 2 ($90) is HUGE and worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It comes with 2 pieces of foie gras and a duck leg (confit), and like a whole freakin duck. It was SO good. We couldn't finish and I was really sad. HUGE portions. - Corn chowder was delicious too - For dessert, I picked ice cream with concord grapes - it was very good. - I also got to pick at my neighbor's cake (we became friends after sitting so close for 2 hours) - 12 layers of buttercream As with any other French restaurants in Montreal, your meal will probably last 2 hours or longer.We were able to get a last minute reservation here the day of for 9ish. We thought we had lucked out. In some ways we did, in some ways we didn't.  It was a great meal but it was crazy expensive. I was under the impression that this place was small but it has expanded to a full rowhouse so capacity was not a problem. Couples shuffled in and out and there were 1 or 2 empty tables near us the entire time. It was kind of cramped as we were crammed in there. We were seated at a 2 top between 2 couples in the back. Our server was lovely and gave us great choices. It was so dark in there and the writing on the board is so narrow and squiggly there is no way you can see the board so you are completely at the server's mercy when it comes to food and wine choices. The choices she gave us was excellent tho but the prices were tremendously inflated. We got a CAD $110 bottle of wine which I found out on the internet was really a USD $38 bottle of wine so I guess it was the standard markup. We had a Great froie gras appetizer and I had the blue cheese rabbit while hubby had a steak that came overcooked. The server asked him about it and he said it was ok but she took the liberty of sending it back and giving him a rare one instead. I didn't know this at the time but for the prices we were about to pay, it was par for the course. His new steak took a while to come. So 2 bottles of wine, 1 appetizer and 2 main courses, 1 salad and a fruit dessert set us back  400 CAD.  It was about 14 CAD for a side salad add on and similar for a berries dessert with cream. They did give us a small complimentary tasting of another wine for the steak mishap. So...it was good but I'm not sure if it was $400 good. I LOVE French Canadian food and have eaten my way through Quebec City on two occasions not having paid nearly as much in a couple of days than what we did tonight. To make myself feel better, I just looked up the exchange rate so the meal was about 300 USD which sits a lot better in my stomach. Still, Joe Beef is kind of overrated but I'm glad we did it. If we were to come back, I'd definitely only have 1 bottle of wine, and skip the expensive extras like dessert and salad.After an anxious six week wait, the night finally came for dinner at Joe Beef! Pros:1. Service is impeccable. All of the staff is very knowledgeable, in-tune with the menu and attentive to allergies. They checked back at just the right frequency. No complaints at all here. 2. Food is definitely above average. Snow crab legs were incredible -- As our server said, they are in season right now so they were very sweet and didn't even need condiments. The lamb sausage was a tad too salty in my opinion and could have used more starch or veggie on the side to balance that out. The strip steak was flavourful but a little more tough than expected. The fries were cute in a mini Creuset but pretty standard in terms of taste. Cons: 1. Menu is only in French and on the blackboard. Being fully bilingual, I didn't mind at all that the menu was in French. More importantly, I just don't think it is practical to have the only version of the menu on the single blackboard that half the restaurant has their back up against. The ONLY thing that partially made up for it was the detail-oriented servers who could cater to individual questions. It just seemed like a bit of a drag for the server to repeat the menu so many times. 2. In terms of value, sad to say that Joe Beef didn't live up to the hype this time. I'm all about paying good money for dinner but we both agreed that the meal just didn't live up to the long wait for reservations and the price.To try next time: - Lobster spaghetti - Rib steak for 2Lives up to the hype. Other than my appetizer being a little over seasoned (fresh pasta with venison), I only have good things to say. Our waitress did an excellent job guiding us through a somewhat cryptic menu on the chalk board and the end result was a memorable three course dinner. The next time a friend from out of town asks me where they should eat when they come to Montreal, I'll probably tell them to go to Joe Beef.Oh my God, Yumm!My Buddy had been frothing at the mouth to come up to Montreal and try this spot. Wouldn't stop talking about it, ha ha.So we did.We started with the Horse Tar Tar, and tell you the truth, with enough of it, that could have been my meal, it was soooooo goooooood!He had the steak, I had the lamb.  The lamb was good, not great.  His steak was to die for. For sure I will be back and have the steak.Tip: the servers in Canada are quite honest about what's good and tasty on the menu, so if they suggest anything, go for it! We almost balked at the horse tar tar, and it ended up being other-wordly!A good restaurant, but not a great one at the time of my visit.We were able to squeeze in a reservation for two at the bar, and were very excited given all the hype this restaurant has. But it just didn't meet those expectations for me. We each had a glass of wine, then followed with the local buffalo mozzarella appetizer which came with 2 slivers of fish and 2 slices of rye toast. The cheese was lovely, but nothing to write home about; it's fresh mozzarella? Next we had the smoked meat croquettes which were really good, easily the highlight of the meal -- it's everything you love about smoked meat squished up into a little tater-tot sized bite with a pickle on top. For entrees, we split the gentleman's steak with bleu cheese and while it was extremely well cooked (rare) it was really pricey for what amounted to a properly cooked steak with a scoop of garlic spinach on the side. However the portion is huge, so if you split it between two it's actually pretty reasonable. For dessert we had the strawberry and pistachio gratin, which was hyped up a lot by the bar staff. The berries were too early to be flavorful so they macerated them in sugar to increase the flavor. The creamy pistachio flan was amazing though! In all, it was a meal with highs (pistachio flan in the strawberry dessert & smoked meat croquettes) and okay points. For a restaurant of it's reputation, we expected more. The ambiance is great, the staff is helpful, but if you're and english speaker you're out of luck -- the menu is in french and only written on one chalkboard. Thankfully I speak french and was able to get by, but I can see how it's hard for others.Great place, note that the menu is 100% in French.One of the single best meals I've ever had. I know it either had to be amazing or grossly overrated as we made reservations 2.5 months in advance and could only score a table at 10PM on a Thursday evening. Needless to say, I had very high expectations for Joe Beef and JB graciously blew those expectations out of the water. The whole menu is in French on a chalkboard on the wall. Luckily, I picked up some French in High School and College and was able to navigate our nosh options well enough. If French wasn't your thang in school then the waiters will give ya a hand with the translation. We also did our homework and mostly knew what we wanted. The goods: We ordered some of the house pickles along with some of their housemade sourdough with butter which were a delicious beginning to the meal. Next was the sliced ham with mushrooms. I have to say this was one of the best bites of food I have ever had the pleasure of consuming. The ham was so wonderfully soft and fresh. The mushrooms were exploding with flavor and then there was a drizzle of a light cream sauce over top. This dish was absolutely divine. Next came the Lobster Spaghetti. If you think you're too old for spaghetti, get over it and order this right now! GIant chunks of lobster + claws served in a heavy cream sauce with over spaghetti. It was so heavy, but worth every artery clogging bite!For dessert we ordered a Strawberry dish that was absolutely incredible. The Strawberries are shipped down from a farm just north of Montreal and they were so amazingly tart, tangy, and fresh. It made me feel as if I had never tasted a strawberry before and I was tasting them for the first time. Yes, sounds exaggerated but it was that good! Our waiter Patrick was absolutely wonderful! He was great on offering suggestions (we asked him to suggest the appetizer for us). He was hysterical, kind, and super quirky.   Perfect meal in the heart of Little Burgundy.Come here prepared to for meat and calorie overload!  But it is exceptionally good and the service was remarkable.  Very simply if you're traveling to the Montreal area you have to go to Joe Beef.  Oh, but plan ahead, they were booked 2 months in advance. I just got lucky with getting a last minute seat at the bar.This place is amazing.  It epitomizes everything you would want in a restaurant named Joe Beef and combines it with impeccable service, awesome attitude and a great ambiance.  Joe Beef isn't a large space (I believe there are two sides) so reservations are a must.  We had a party of 8 reserved into two groups of 4, but the hostess didn't drop a beat when we told her 2 in our party were delayed.  She seated us in an awesome table for 6 but most importantly paired us with one of the best waitresses I've ever had.  She clearly saw that we were tourists, but that's one thing that I loved about Montreal.  Many of the cool places that we went to, they welcome and are friendly to tourists and this place was no different.  It looked like it was full of French Canadians, but you couldn't tell as they effortlessly switched from English to French catering to their customer.  The menu is a revolving one and written only on the chalkboard nightly, so describing the dishes accurately is almost impossible.  Suffice it to say everything was amazing and it was easily one of the best meat-centric meals I've had in my life.  I was in heaven.  We started off with drinks and I never saw a cocktail menu but the waitress was able to order everyone drinks they loved based on just a brief description of base drink preference (ie: gin, vodka, etc.)  The drinks are strong and tasty and while perhaps not as complex as the artisinal cocktails we had at Lab just before, they were good.  I had no idea how much they cost either.  Then we started off with appetizers.  She knew we were familiar with the famous Foie Gras double down but informed us they no longer sold it.  She saw our sad faces and said would order a selection that would make us happy.  Our waitress never pushed any item (ie: their oysters are famous, but we didn't feel like any) and it really was one of the most fun and engaging ordering experiences I've had.  Foie Gras Small Bites - deep fried and filled with tiny bits of foie gras and potato.  Delicious.  This place knows meat, fried, and smoked.Mozzarella served with Toast - fresh mozzarella cheese sliced and served with toast.  A nice change and balance to all the meat.Sunnyside up Duck Eggs with Pomme Frites - I've never had eggs this good and I've sous vide many eggs. This was better.  It was super rich, seasoned perfectly and the fries were amazing.Foie Gras And Ham Sandwich - this was to make up for the double down.  Split 6 ways, we each only got a small bite, but the salty foie gras sauce and milder ham went with the decant biscuit bread with sauce.  Puff Pastry with Smoked Turkey - our waitresses favorite appetizer.  It was good but tasted a bit like turkey with small bread puffs.  Not interesting enough.Minced Duck and Seared Foie Gras - the duck looked like a steak but broke into parts of duck meat.  The seared foie gras on top was delicious and the berry sauce was a perfect contrast.  Venison Sausage - loved it.  Did I say they do meats well?Lobster Spaghetti - another famous dish.  Whole lobster with cream sauce and perfect al dente noodles.  One of my favorites of the night.  Seared Rib Eye Steak - seasoned perfectly, cooked perfectly, finished completely.Horse Meat Filet Mignon - wrapped with bacon and served with potatoes.  This was a novelty as I've never had horse meat.  Cooked perfectly medium rare the meat was delicious and a very different texture than any meat I've had.  Worth trying once.  Deep Fried Cauliflower - covered in cheese but an obligatory vegetable.Lamb Steak - yet another meat, cooked so perfectly and completely different flavor.  Duck Fat Fries - the perfect starch to complement the meat.  We were too full from drink and food for dessert but finished our meal with laughter with the staff learning French phrases, sharing the best spots for food and merriment and finishing with shots on the house.  Our bill wasn't cheap but the final price was less than I guessed.  It also was one of the best meat meals I've had in my life.  I missed Au Pied du Cochon but I don't think I would have wanted to trade away Joe Beef.  Joe Beef accepts credit cards.A pure 5 star rating without a doubt in my mind. We came to Montreal to specifically go to Joe Beef and it was certainly worth it! Rated one of the most difficult places to get a reservation, we booked many moons ahead of time. Upon arrival, we noticed all the menu items were written on a chalk board. Having poor vision, combined with dimmed lighting, I opted to go with the chefs choice for 6 courses.  It relieved us of the stress of deciding what we should share while adding a layer of anticipation and surprise.  Out waiter was terrific as he attended multiple tables with his cat shirt in celebration of National Cat Day.Favorite dishes: bone marrow, calamari stuffed with meat in a red wine mushroom sauce and apple donuts with smoked Gouda.While everything was perfectly cooked, a bit too salty on some of the more savory items.  Just a general preference of mine, but it didn't stop me from eating everything!How many times have I come to Montreal and NOT eaten here???  This place is amazing!!!  Fish of the day for two: perfectly cooked white fish in a butter wine sauce with roe mixed in, served with a side of clams and little potatoes.  Horse filet mignon (unreal), tender, cooked medium rare, it was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  Served with mashed potatoes.  Duck dish topped with a piece of foie gras.  This came with a side of vegetable but I cannot recall at this point.Even the soft serve ice cream was yummy.  A refreshing end to a most decadent meal.  Everything was fantastic.  I would come back here in an instant.  I would recommend it to everyone!I loved everything about this restaurant.  The food, the service... it was the highlight of my weekend!This place is exceptionally good!Geez- I don't know where to begin. Our table of four shared about a dozen dishes. The highlights being the Horse Tartare, a pasta with Fois Gras and deer shoulder, the smoked crispy fried trout, and the New York Strip with blue cheese.The cocktails were kinda meh.......... but the service and general experience was all on point.I would visit Joe Beef again in a heartbeat. It's one of the best dining experiences I have had.If I have a Jen K's Top 10 Restaurant List, Joe Beef would definitely be on it. And in fact, I might even able to say My Last Meal on Earth I want to have it here. (Yelp's profile question and they do serves uni!)I have been to Liverpool House, Joe Beef's sister restaurant right next door but Joe Beef is the real deal.The menu is seasonal but interesting. A mixture of seafood and meat and even vegetables. And of course foie gras!Everything we ordered were amazing. And the wait staff is just so knowledgeable with the menu and able to make awesome recommendations.The vibe is relaxing especially out on the back patio on a nice summer evening. And of these for a reasonable price! Just make sure you make a reservation ASAP, Joe Beef is just so popular and definitely worth all the hype!Joe Beef is really freakin' good.  It's been about 2 months since I've eaten there while vacationing in Montreal and I still think fondly back on it.The menu rotates pretty often - but for what it's worth - we grabbed the whole flounder with lobster bisque gravy (came with a side of mussels and lobster cream sauced veggies), slow-cooked lamb neck with sausage, seared scallops and foie gras parfait.Other than the scallops (which was fresh and perfectly cooked, but definitely hard to break the mold), everything else was exceptional.  The weirdest thing was the foie gras parfait - which was raw foie gras whipped with egg yolks and paired with tart (rather than sweet) cherries and cherry jam.  It was very strange (seriously, foie for a 'dessert' appetizer) but it worked.  It came in a big bowl so whatever we didn't have on the bread was added as a topping to everything else.  I wish the lamb neck was a bit gamier, but still excellent.  Finally, the flounder was spectacular.Service was excellent.  We were immediately seated after confirming our reservation (if you are planning a trip - do make reservations well in advance).  The service was atypical - friendly but very relaxed.  The menu board is extremely difficult for non-French speakers to read due to the dim lights.  Our waiter just told us he recommended 'everything' but was very knowledgeable, answered all our questions and gauged our appetites well as he told us to stop ordering as he was confident we had 'more than enough' food and he was right.  He really steered us to configure an optimal meal that satisfied everyone at the table considering some unique dietary restrictions.Also, the meal was surprisingly affordable.  With everything mentioned and two beers, the bill came to $65 each for the four of us - tax and tip included.Easily the best restaurant I've been to in Canada.Did not live up to the hype for me: *the smoked meat croquettes were little salt bombs and a bit one note for me.  The sliced pickles just added to the sodium.*seemed dingy inside and there were flies in the restaurant, but thought all the knick knacks strewn throughout were nice photo ops*the horse tartare is phenomenal, loved the shaved matsutakes and the brioche, heavenly.  Best red meat tartare I have ever had.  *if you must get the lobster pasta, get the half portion, it was just okay, pasta al dente, the shellfish could have been better, heavy, creamy, could have used more fresh herbs and again, a lot of the same flavor*veal, escargot and bone marrow, impressive looking dish and was more like short rib type meat than a steak-just falls apart.  Very good and very rich.  Tip: take a photo of the chalkboard and read the menu from your device.  Everyone was struggling and craning their necks.  It's been rather warm the last week, no AC at JB.  Loved our little window nook booth, but I think the garden would have been a great alternative.Reasonable pricing $160 CAD for 4 items, 2 glasses of wine, tax and tip.  We were stuffed.  Great servers and interesting meal, but my least favorite planned meal of the trip.This is my second favorite restaurant in Montreal, ranked only below it's sister restaurant, Liverpool House. Before I get into my review, first, a confession. I came here, too, because of Anthony Bordain. I am not proud of it, I wish I was a cool-kid Montreal-er, but alas I am merely a uni-lingual American.  In fact, my boyfriend and I designed a whole vacation around getting a reservation at Joe Beef. The atmosphere: Joe Beef is simultaneously sexy and casual. It has dark mood lighting, but hockey memorabilia decor. They play Neil Young and French singers I do not recognize. Your plates and glasses are mismatched, and appear to come from a cool thrift store. The bar is boisterous-  ladies cackling, men singing, loud debates amounting, etc. ( an example from our dinner: whether Americans are bigger prudes than Canadians). The staff are irreverent and knowledgeable. Almost all of them seem to have a gleam of mischievous in their eyes. The Food: I ordered some sort of lamb sausage plate, the cocktail of the day (x3), and PEI oysters. My other half ordered the pheasant and wine. We were both very happy. If I had to describe the food, I'd say it was decedent,and intense. My lamb dish was so huge, it presented like a dare. It wasn't prepared like your usual lamb, in that it was not Mediterranean inspired. It actually reminded me a lot of the food I ate in Prague - made to keep you full and warm. It had a dark aroma - of spices I did not recognize but enjoyed. The Oysters were meaty and briny, and served with a very spicy homemade hot sauce. The star of our night was desert, Marjolaine (a painstaking, many-layered chocolate and hazelnut cake). It was the best desert I've ever had in my life. For those Anthony Bordain fans morjolaine was featured in the No Reservations, Quebec episode. There is also a recipe for it in Joe Beef's cookbook. Anyways, making a pilgrimage to Joe Beef should definitely be on any foodie's vacation itinerary. The food, atmosphere, and service were wonderful. I felt right at home in my comfy booth, tearing through animal parts and slogging beer.Food 5 / 5 decor 5 / 5 service 5 / 5 We were 4, made reservations 2 months prior. Everything about the experience was perfection, one of the best part of joe beef is that you get top notch quality without the snootiness. You can get there in a suit, or in sweats, it won't matter because everyone is there for one reason: hearty, meaty, and delicious cuisine du terroir. The staff knows the food inside out as if they've cooked everything themselves.1. Smoked trout 26$2. Duck terrine 17$3. Large pulled pork with butternut squash gnocchis (regular 27$ large 40.50$) 4. Roasted Fowl 66$5. Side of bone marrow 16$6. Order of fries with parmesan flakes 8$7. Pear pie with housemade Pear and clove ice cream 16$+ 2 bottles of wine (white 65$ and red 65$)+ 3 coffees (3$ each)Everything above was shared. With tax and a 15% tip our total was 435$. For me, the pulled pork stole the show,  it's as if the meat just melted in your mouth, it was so tender. And the ice cream I would buy by the gallon if I could.It's been a while since I wrote a review but I've been busy enjoying life.  Anyways, here goes a review of a highly recommended restaurant I went in Montreal earlier this month.  I came with a friend I haven't seen since college so needless to say, there was a lot we had to catch up on.The setting is quite intimate but it didn't hinder a good conversation.  What we didn't like was the menu.  It is a blackboard hung up high in the wall and written in French only.  The handwriting was like a doctor's prescription and the blackboard was not properly erased so it made reading the menu immensely difficult (not to mention I didn't bring my glasses or read French).I thought the service was ok.  My friend thought our server was a little pretentious.  Anyhow, at least they offered to sell me a half portion of their famous lobster spaghetti.  That allowed me to enjoy some oysters and Canadian sea urchin (uni) as appetizer.  It would be too much food otherwise.  Taste-wise, everything was on par and predictable.It is a pricey place so do save it for a special occasion.  Reservation necessary.As I watched our cheerful server patiently (and entertainingly) translate the French-language menu in its entirety, I was at first dubious, then astonished, and finally delighted.  It was a glimpse into the workings of an establishment of humble origins that has gained acclaim as one of Canada's premier restaurants.The service here is genuinely welcoming.  I am reminded of the graciousness that defines hospitality at a Danny Meyer restaurant.  Without hovering, our servers were there when needed.  From a fine wine list dominated by bottles in the triple digits, our server swiftly ascertained our preference for a lower end choice, then narrowed down a flavor profile in just a brief, bantering exchange.  It was near worth ordering a second bottle for.An argument can be made for two bottles.  Although renowned as a meat-centric restaurant, Joe Beef is equally at ease with seafood, so a sampling of both is reasonable.  One of their more impressive starters were two whole, small trout showered with seasonally fresh vegetables.  The tender meat is gently smoked, yielding a flavor that is surprisingly restrained: enough to accent, not enough to dominate.  Shellfish shined in an equally wonderful sausage of lobster and clams; plump, juicy, and brimming with the flavors of its ingredients.  If the starter menu isn't enough, a few quality, local raw bar options are offered.  Raw oysters are de rigueur, but more interesting was a fresh uni prepared in a light tomato sauce and served in its shell, or the sweet snow crab legs.Of course, it would be sinful to eschew meat at Joe Beef, which offers up a few sharable beef entrees, along with foie gras, Canadian smoked meat, duck, rabbit, horse, lamb, and chicken dishes.  Foie gras parfait is flawless; creamy and luxurious, perfectly offset by a bite of crisp, sharp radish on warm, crusty brioche.  The same brioche is molded like a nest around smooth horse tartare, although robust seasoning muffled the sweetness of raw horse.  Simple, expertly cooked duck breast was a marvel of flavor and succulence.It is easy to see how this utterly charming restaurant is as famed as it is.  It is not for a specific dish, gimmick, or personality.  With its constantly changing menu penned only on chalkboard, Joe Beef announces its allegiance to local, seasonal foods, and prepares them exceptionally well.  Add to that the warmth of the staff and a uniquely home-like atmosphere between its cozy, tavern-like space inside and a festive outdoor area reminiscent of a patio.  It makes for a highly enjoyable, low-key dining experience that seems effortless in execution yet must surely be anything but.  And it will have one thinking about a return visit as soon as possible.I LOVED our waitress!

The fries were cute in a mini Creuset but pretty standard in terms of taste. Cons: 1. Menu is only in French and on the blackboard. Being fully bilingual, I didn't mind at all that the menu was in French. More importantly, I just don't think it is practical to have the only version of the menu on the single blackboard that half the restaurant has their back up against. The ONLY thing that partially made up for it was the detail-oriented servers who could cater to individual questions. It just seemed like a bit of a drag for the server to repeat the menu so many times. 2. In terms of value, sad to say that Joe Beef didn't live up to the hype this time. I'm all about paying good money for dinner but we both agreed that the meal just didn't live up to the long wait for reservations and the price.To try next time: - Lobster spaghetti - Rib steak for 2Lives up to the hype. Other than my appetizer being a little over seasoned (fresh pasta with venison), I only have good things to say. Our waitress did an excellent job guiding us through a somewhat cryptic menu on the chalk board and the end result was a memorable three course dinner. The next time a friend from out of town asks me where they should eat when they come to Montreal, I'll probably tell them to go to Joe Beef.Oh my God, Yumm!My Buddy had been frothing at the mouth to come up to Montreal and try this spot. Wouldn't stop talking about it, ha ha.So we did.We started with the Horse Tar Tar, and tell you the truth, with enough of it, that could have been my meal, it was soooooo goooooood!He had the steak, I had the lamb.  The lamb was good, not great.  His steak was to die for. For sure I will be back and have the steak.Tip: the servers in Canada are quite honest about what's good and tasty on the menu, so if they suggest anything, go for it! We almost balked at the horse tar tar, and it ended up being other-wordly!A good restaurant, but not a great one at the time of my visit.We were able to squeeze in a reservation for two at the bar, and were very excited given all the hype this restaurant has. But it just didn't meet those expectations for me. We each had a glass of wine, then followed with the local buffalo mozzarella appetizer which came with 2 slivers of fish and 2 slices of rye toast. The cheese was lovely, but nothing to write home about; it's fresh mozzarella? Next we had the smoked meat croquettes which were really good, easily the highlight of the meal -- it's everything you love about smoked meat squished up into a little tater-tot sized bite with a pickle on top. For entrees, we split the gentleman's steak with bleu cheese and while it was extremely well cooked (rare) it was really pricey for what amounted to a properly cooked steak with a scoop of garlic spinach on the side. However the portion is huge, so if you split it between two it's actually pretty reasonable. For dessert we had the strawberry and pistachio gratin, which was hyped up a lot by the bar staff. The berries were too early to be flavorful so they macerated them in sugar to increase the flavor. The creamy pistachio flan was amazing though! In all, it was a meal with highs (pistachio flan in the strawberry dessert & smoked meat croquettes) and okay points. For a restaurant of it's reputation, we expected more. The ambiance is great, the staff is helpful, but if you're and english speaker you're out of luck -- the menu is in french and only written on one chalkboard. Thankfully I speak french and was able to get by, but I can see how it's hard for others.Great place, note that the menu is 100% in French.One of the single best meals I've ever had. I know it either had to be amazing or grossly overrated as we made reservations 2.5 months in advance and could only score a table at 10PM on a Thursday evening. Needless to say, I had very high expectations for Joe Beef and JB graciously blew those expectations out of the water. The whole menu is in French on a chalkboard on the wall. Luckily, I picked up some French in High School and College and was able to navigate our nosh options well enough. If French wasn't your thang in school then the waiters will give ya a hand with the translation. We also did our homework and mostly knew what we wanted. The goods: We ordered some of the house pickles along with some of their housemade sourdough with butter which were a delicious beginning to the meal. Next was the sliced ham with mushrooms. I have to say this was one of the best bites of food I have ever had the pleasure of consuming. The ham was so wonderfully soft and fresh. The mushrooms were exploding with flavor and then there was a drizzle of a light cream sauce over top. This dish was absolutely divine. Next came the Lobster Spaghetti. If you think you're too old for spaghetti, get over it and order this right now! GIant chunks of lobster + claws served in a heavy cream sauce with over spaghetti. It was so heavy, but worth every artery clogging bite!For dessert we ordered a Strawberry dish that was absolutely incredible. The Strawberries are shipped down from a farm just north of Montreal and they were so amazingly tart, tangy, and fresh. It made me feel as if I had never tasted a strawberry before and I was tasting them for the first time. Yes, sounds exaggerated but it was that good! Our waiter Patrick was absolutely wonderful! He was great on offering suggestions (we asked him to suggest the appetizer for us). He was hysterical, kind, and super quirky.   Perfect meal in the heart of Little Burgundy.Come here prepared to for meat and calorie overload!  But it is exceptionally good and the service was remarkable.  Very simply if you're traveling to the Montreal area you have to go to Joe Beef.  Oh, but plan ahead, they were booked 2 months in advance. I just got lucky with getting a last minute seat at the bar.This place is amazing.  It epitomizes everything you would want in a restaurant named Joe Beef and combines it with impeccable service, awesome attitude and a great ambiance.  Joe Beef isn't a large space (I believe there are two sides) so reservations are a must.  We had a party of 8 reserved into two groups of 4, but the hostess didn't drop a beat when we told her 2 in our party were delayed.  She seated us in an awesome table for 6 but most importantly paired us with one of the best waitresses I've ever had.  She clearly saw that we were tourists, but that's one thing that I loved about Montreal.  Many of the cool places that we went to, they welcome and are friendly to tourists and this place was no different.  It looked like it was full of French Canadians, but you couldn't tell as they effortlessly switched from English to French catering to their customer.  The menu is a revolving one and written only on the chalkboard nightly, so describing the dishes accurately is almost impossible.  Suffice it to say everything was amazing and it was easily one of the best meat-centric meals I've had in my life.  I was in heaven.  We started off with drinks and I never saw a cocktail menu but the waitress was able to order everyone drinks they loved based on just a brief description of base drink preference (ie: gin, vodka, etc.)  The drinks are strong and tasty and while perhaps not as complex as the artisinal cocktails we had at Lab just before, they were good.  I had no idea how much they cost either.  Then we started off with appetizers.  She knew we were familiar with the famous Foie Gras double down but informed us they no longer sold it.  She saw our sad faces and said would order a selection that would make us happy.  Our waitress never pushed any item (ie: their oysters are famous, but we didn't feel like any) and it really was one of the most fun and engaging ordering experiences I've had.  Foie Gras Small Bites - deep fried and filled with tiny bits of foie gras and potato.  Delicious.  This place knows meat, fried, and smoked.Mozzarella served with Toast - fresh mozzarella cheese sliced and served with toast.  A nice change and balance to all the meat.Sunnyside up Duck Eggs with Pomme Frites - I've never had eggs this good and I've sous vide many eggs. This was better.  It was super rich, seasoned perfectly and the fries were amazing.Foie Gras And Ham Sandwich - this was to make up for the double down.  Split 6 ways, we each only got a small bite, but the salty foie gras sauce and milder ham went with the decant biscuit bread with sauce.  Puff Pastry with Smoked Turkey - our waitresses favorite appetizer.  It was good but tasted a bit like turkey with small bread puffs.  Not interesting enough.Minced Duck and Seared Foie Gras - the duck looked like a steak but broke into parts of duck meat.  The seared foie gras on top was delicious and the berry sauce was a perfect contrast.  Venison Sausage - loved it.  Did I say they do meats well?Lobster Spaghetti - another famous dish.  Whole lobster with cream sauce and perfect al dente noodles.  One of my favorites of the night.  Seared Rib Eye Steak - seasoned perfectly, cooked perfectly, finished completely.Horse Meat Filet Mignon - wrapped with bacon and served with potatoes.  This was a novelty as I've never had horse meat.  Cooked perfectly medium rare the meat was delicious and a very different texture than any meat I've had.  Worth trying once.  Deep Fried Cauliflower - covered in cheese but an obligatory vegetable.Lamb Steak - yet another meat, cooked so perfectly and completely different flavor.  Duck Fat Fries - the perfect starch to complement the meat.  We were too full from drink and food for dessert but finished our meal with laughter with the staff learning French phrases, sharing the best spots for food and merriment and finishing with shots on the house.  Our bill wasn't cheap but the final price was less than I guessed.  It also was one of the best meat meals I've had in my life.  I missed Au Pied du Cochon but I don't think I would have wanted to trade away Joe Beef.  Joe Beef accepts credit cards.A pure 5 star rating without a doubt in my mind. We came to Montreal to specifically go to Joe Beef and it was certainly worth it! Rated one of the most difficult places to get a reservation, we booked many moons ahead of time. Upon arrival, we noticed all the menu items were written on a chalk board. Having poor vision, combined with dimmed lighting, I opted to go with the chefs choice for 6 courses.  It relieved us of the stress of deciding what we should share while adding a layer of anticipation and surprise.  Out waiter was terrific as he attended multiple tables with his cat shirt in celebration of National Cat Day.Favorite dishes: bone marrow, calamari stuffed with meat in a red wine mushroom sauce and apple donuts with smoked Gouda.While everything was perfectly cooked, a bit too salty on some of the more savory items.  Just a general preference of mine, but it didn't stop me from eating everything!How many times have I come to Montreal and NOT eaten here???  This place is amazing!!!  Fish of the day for two: perfectly cooked white fish in a butter wine sauce with roe mixed in, served with a side of clams and little potatoes.  Horse filet mignon (unreal), tender, cooked medium rare, it was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  Served with mashed potatoes.  Duck dish topped with a piece of foie gras.  This came with a side of vegetable but I cannot recall at this point.Even the soft serve ice cream was yummy.  A refreshing end to a most decadent meal.  Everything was fantastic.  I would come back here in an instant.  I would recommend it to everyone!I loved everything about this restaurant.  The food, the service... it was the highlight of my weekend!This place is exceptionally good!Geez- I don't know where to begin. Our table of four shared about a dozen dishes. The highlights being the Horse Tartare, a pasta with Fois Gras and deer shoulder, the smoked crispy fried trout, and the New York Strip with blue cheese.The cocktails were kinda meh.......... but the service and general experience was all on point.I would visit Joe Beef again in a heartbeat. It's one of the best dining experiences I have had.If I have a Jen K's Top 10 Restaurant List, Joe Beef would definitely be on it. And in fact, I might even able to say My Last Meal on Earth I want to have it here. (Yelp's profile question and they do serves uni!)I have been to Liverpool House, Joe Beef's sister restaurant right next door but Joe Beef is the real deal.The menu is seasonal but interesting. A mixture of seafood and meat and even vegetables. And of course foie gras!Everything we ordered were amazing. And the wait staff is just so knowledgeable with the menu and able to make awesome recommendations.The vibe is relaxing especially out on the back patio on a nice summer evening. And of these for a reasonable price! Just make sure you make a reservation ASAP, Joe Beef is just so popular and definitely worth all the hype!Joe Beef is really freakin' good.  It's been about 2 months since I've eaten there while vacationing in Montreal and I still think fondly back on it.The menu rotates pretty often - but for what it's worth - we grabbed the whole flounder with lobster bisque gravy (came with a side of mussels and lobster cream sauced veggies), slow-cooked lamb neck with sausage, seared scallops and foie gras parfait.Other than the scallops (which was fresh and perfectly cooked, but definitely hard to break the mold), everything else was exceptional.  The weirdest thing was the foie gras parfait - which was raw foie gras whipped with egg yolks and paired with tart (rather than sweet) cherries and cherry jam.  It was very strange (seriously, foie for a 'dessert' appetizer) but it worked.  It came in a big bowl so whatever we didn't have on the bread was added as a topping to everything else.  I wish the lamb neck was a bit gamier, but still excellent.  Finally, the flounder was spectacular.Service was excellent.  We were immediately seated after confirming our reservation (if you are planning a trip - do make reservations well in advance).  The service was atypical - friendly but very relaxed.  The menu board is extremely difficult for non-French speakers to read due to the dim lights.  Our waiter just told us he recommended 'everything' but was very knowledgeable, answered all our questions and gauged our appetites well as he told us to stop ordering as he was confident we had 'more than enough' food and he was right.  He really steered us to configure an optimal meal that satisfied everyone at the table considering some unique dietary restrictions.Also, the meal was surprisingly affordable.  With everything mentioned and two beers, the bill came to $65 each for the four of us - tax and tip included.Easily the best restaurant I've been to in Canada.Did not live up to the hype for me: *the smoked meat croquettes were little salt bombs and a bit one note for me.  The sliced pickles just added to the sodium.*seemed dingy inside and there were flies in the restaurant, but thought all the knick knacks strewn throughout were nice photo ops*the horse tartare is phenomenal, loved the shaved matsutakes and the brioche, heavenly.  Best red meat tartare I have ever had.  *if you must get the lobster pasta, get the half portion, it was just okay, pasta al dente, the shellfish could have been better, heavy, creamy, could have used more fresh herbs and again, a lot of the same flavor*veal, escargot and bone marrow, impressive looking dish and was more like short rib type meat than a steak-just falls apart.  Very good and very rich.  Tip: take a photo of the chalkboard and read the menu from your device.  Everyone was struggling and craning their necks.  It's been rather warm the last week, no AC at JB.  Loved our little window nook booth, but I think the garden would have been a great alternative.Reasonable pricing $160 CAD for 4 items, 2 glasses of wine, tax and tip.  We were stuffed.  Great servers and interesting meal, but my least favorite planned meal of the trip.This is my second favorite restaurant in Montreal, ranked only below it's sister restaurant, Liverpool House. Before I get into my review, first, a confession. I came here, too, because of Anthony Bordain. I am not proud of it, I wish I was a cool-kid Montreal-er, but alas I am merely a uni-lingual American.  In fact, my boyfriend and I designed a whole vacation around getting a reservation at Joe Beef. The atmosphere: Joe Beef is simultaneously sexy and casual. It has dark mood lighting, but hockey memorabilia decor. They play Neil Young and French singers I do not recognize. Your plates and glasses are mismatched, and appear to come from a cool thrift store. The bar is boisterous-  ladies cackling, men singing, loud debates amounting, etc. ( an example from our dinner: whether Americans are bigger prudes than Canadians). The staff are irreverent and knowledgeable. Almost all of them seem to have a gleam of mischievous in their eyes. The Food: I ordered some sort of lamb sausage plate, the cocktail of the day (x3), and PEI oysters. My other half ordered the pheasant and wine. We were both very happy. If I had to describe the food, I'd say it was decedent,and intense. My lamb dish was so huge, it presented like a dare. It wasn't prepared like your usual lamb, in that it was not Mediterranean inspired. It actually reminded me a lot of the food I ate in Prague - made to keep you full and warm. It had a dark aroma - of spices I did not recognize but enjoyed. The Oysters were meaty and briny, and served with a very spicy homemade hot sauce. The star of our night was desert, Marjolaine (a painstaking, many-layered chocolate and hazelnut cake). It was the best desert I've ever had in my life. For those Anthony Bordain fans morjolaine was featured in the No Reservations, Quebec episode. There is also a recipe for it in Joe Beef's cookbook. Anyways, making a pilgrimage to Joe Beef should definitely be on any foodie's vacation itinerary. The food, atmosphere, and service were wonderful. I felt right at home in my comfy booth, tearing through animal parts and slogging beer.Food 5 / 5 decor 5 / 5 service 5 / 5 We were 4, made reservations 2 months prior. Everything about the experience was perfection, one of the best part of joe beef is that you get top notch quality without the snootiness. You can get there in a suit, or in sweats, it won't matter because everyone is there for one reason: hearty, meaty, and delicious cuisine du terroir. The staff knows the food inside out as if they've cooked everything themselves.1. Smoked trout 26$2. Duck terrine 17$3. Large pulled pork with butternut squash gnocchis (regular 27$ large 40.50$) 4. Roasted Fowl 66$5. Side of bone marrow 16$6. Order of fries with parmesan flakes 8$7. Pear pie with housemade Pear and clove ice cream 16$+ 2 bottles of wine (white 65$ and red 65$)+ 3 coffees (3$ each)Everything above was shared. With tax and a 15% tip our total was 435$. For me, the pulled pork stole the show,  it's as if the meat just melted in your mouth, it was so tender. And the ice cream I would buy by the gallon if I could.It's been a while since I wrote a review but I've been busy enjoying life.  Anyways, here goes a review of a highly recommended restaurant I went in Montreal earlier this month.  I came with a friend I haven't seen since college so needless to say, there was a lot we had to catch up on.The setting is quite intimate but it didn't hinder a good conversation.  What we didn't like was the menu.  It is a blackboard hung up high in the wall and written in French only.  The handwriting was like a doctor's prescription and the blackboard was not properly erased so it made reading the menu immensely difficult (not to mention I didn't bring my glasses or read French).I thought the service was ok.  My friend thought our server was a little pretentious.  Anyhow, at least they offered to sell me a half portion of their famous lobster spaghetti.  That allowed me to enjoy some oysters and Canadian sea urchin (uni) as appetizer.  It would be too much food otherwise.  Taste-wise, everything was on par and predictable.It is a pricey place so do save it for a special occasion.  Reservation necessary.As I watched our cheerful server patiently (and entertainingly) translate the French-language menu in its entirety, I was at first dubious, then astonished, and finally delighted.  It was a glimpse into the workings of an establishment of humble origins that has gained acclaim as one of Canada's premier restaurants.The service here is genuinely welcoming.  I am reminded of the graciousness that defines hospitality at a Danny Meyer restaurant.  Without hovering, our servers were there when needed.  From a fine wine list dominated by bottles in the triple digits, our server swiftly ascertained our preference for a lower end choice, then narrowed down a flavor profile in just a brief, bantering exchange.  It was near worth ordering a second bottle for.An argument can be made for two bottles.  Although renowned as a meat-centric restaurant, Joe Beef is equally at ease with seafood, so a sampling of both is reasonable.  One of their more impressive starters were two whole, small trout showered with seasonally fresh vegetables.  The tender meat is gently smoked, yielding a flavor that is surprisingly restrained: enough to accent, not enough to dominate.  Shellfish shined in an equally wonderful sausage of lobster and clams; plump, juicy, and brimming with the flavors of its ingredients.  If the starter menu isn't enough, a few quality, local raw bar options are offered.  Raw oysters are de rigueur, but more interesting was a fresh uni prepared in a light tomato sauce and served in its shell, or the sweet snow crab legs.Of course, it would be sinful to eschew meat at Joe Beef, which offers up a few sharable beef entrees, along with foie gras, Canadian smoked meat, duck, rabbit, horse, lamb, and chicken dishes.  Foie gras parfait is flawless; creamy and luxurious, perfectly offset by a bite of crisp, sharp radish on warm, crusty brioche.  The same brioche is molded like a nest around smooth horse tartare, although robust seasoning muffled the sweetness of raw horse.  Simple, expertly cooked duck breast was a marvel of flavor and succulence.It is easy to see how this utterly charming restaurant is as famed as it is.  It is not for a specific dish, gimmick, or personality.  With its constantly changing menu penned only on chalkboard, Joe Beef announces its allegiance to local, seasonal foods, and prepares them exceptionally well.  Add to that the warmth of the staff and a uniquely home-like atmosphere between its cozy, tavern-like space inside and a festive outdoor area reminiscent of a patio.  It makes for a highly enjoyable, low-key dining experience that seems effortless in execution yet must surely be anything but.  And it will have one thinking about a return visit as soon as possible.I LOVED our waitress! She was so friendly and down-to-earth. - I made my reservations 3 months in advance (that's the earliest you can make it) - It's a dimly-lit, tiny restaurant, very homey and intimate - They played some great music while we were there (biggie smalls and some frenchy music)- The menu is written on the chalkboard (behind people sitting in the restaurant) - just take a picture with your smart phone and look at the menu from your seat instead of cranking your neck around and struggling to read it - The waitress encourages you to get up from your seat to look at the menu and she can answer any questions or give you recommendations - Duck for 2 ($90) is HUGE and worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It comes with 2 pieces of foie gras and a duck leg (confit), and like a whole freakin duck. It was SO good. We couldn't finish and I was really sad. HUGE portions. - Corn chowder was delicious too - For dessert, I picked ice cream with concord grapes - it was very good. - I also got to pick at my neighbor's cake (we became friends after sitting so close for 2 hours) - 12 layers of buttercream As with any other French restaurants in Montreal, your meal will probably last 2 hours or longer.We were able to get a last minute reservation here the day of for 9ish. We thought we had lucked out. In some ways we did, in some ways we didn't.  It was a great meal but it was crazy expensive. I was under the impression that this place was small but it has expanded to a full rowhouse so capacity was not a problem. Couples shuffled in and out and there were 1 or 2 empty tables near us the entire time. It was kind of cramped as we were crammed in there. We were seated at a 2 top between 2 couples in the back. Our server was lovely and gave us great choices. It was so dark in there and the writing on the board is so narrow and squiggly there is no way you can see the board so you are completely at the server's mercy when it comes to food and wine choices. The choices she gave us was excellent tho but the prices were tremendously inflated. We got a CAD $110 bottle of wine which I found out on the internet was really a USD $38 bottle of wine so I guess it was the standard markup. We had a Great froie gras appetizer and I had the blue cheese rabbit while hubby had a steak that came overcooked. The server asked him about it and he said it was ok but she took the liberty of sending it back and giving him a rare one instead. I didn't know this at the time but for the prices we were about to pay, it was par for the course. His new steak took a while to come. So 2 bottles of wine, 1 appetizer and 2 main courses, 1 salad and a fruit dessert set us back  400 CAD.  It was about 14 CAD for a side salad add on and similar for a berries dessert with cream. They did give us a small complimentary tasting of another wine for the steak mishap. So...it was good but I'm not sure if it was $400 good. I LOVE French Canadian food and have eaten my way through Quebec City on two occasions not having paid nearly as much in a couple of days than what we did tonight. To make myself feel better, I just looked up the exchange rate so the meal was about 300 USD which sits a lot better in my stomach. Still, Joe Beef is kind of overrated but I'm glad we did it. If we were to come back, I'd definitely only have 1 bottle of wine, and skip the expensive extras like dessert and salad.After an anxious six week wait, the night finally came for dinner at Joe Beef! Pros:1. Service is impeccable. All of the staff is very knowledgeable, in-tune with the menu and attentive to allergies. They checked back at just the right frequency. No complaints at all here. 2. Food is definitely above average. Snow crab legs were incredible -- As our server said, they are in season right now so they were very sweet and didn't even need condiments. The lamb sausage was a tad too salty in my opinion and could have used more starch or veggie on the side to balance that out. The strip steak was flavourful but a little more tough than expected. The fries were cute in a mini Creuset but pretty standard in terms of taste. Cons: 1. Menu is only in French and on the blackboard. Being fully bilingual, I didn't mind at all that the menu was in French. More importantly, I just don't think it is practical to have the only version of the menu on the single blackboard that half the restaurant has their back up against. The ONLY thing that partially made up for it was the detail-oriented servers who could cater to individual questions. It just seemed like a bit of a drag for the server to repeat the menu so many times. 2. In terms of value, sad to say that Joe Beef didn't live up to the hype this time. I'm all about paying good money for dinner but we both agreed that the meal just didn't live up to the long wait for reservations and the price.To try next time: - Lobster spaghetti - Rib steak for 2Lives up to the hype. Other than my appetizer being a little over seasoned (fresh pasta with venison), I only have good things to say. Our waitress did an excellent job guiding us through a somewhat cryptic menu on the chalk board and the end result was a memorable three course dinner.

I just got lucky with getting a last minute seat at the bar.This place is amazing.  It epitomizes everything you would want in a restaurant named Joe Beef and combines it with impeccable service, awesome attitude and a great ambiance.  Joe Beef isn't a large space (I believe there are two sides) so reservations are a must.  We had a party of 8 reserved into two groups of 4, but the hostess didn't drop a beat when we told her 2 in our party were delayed.  She seated us in an awesome table for 6 but most importantly paired us with one of the best waitresses I've ever had.  She clearly saw that we were tourists, but that's one thing that I loved about Montreal.  Many of the cool places that we went to, they welcome and are friendly to tourists and this place was no different.  It looked like it was full of French Canadians, but you couldn't tell as they effortlessly switched from English to French catering to their customer.  The menu is a revolving one and written only on the chalkboard nightly, so describing the dishes accurately is almost impossible.  Suffice it to say everything was amazing and it was easily one of the best meat-centric meals I've had in my life.  I was in heaven.  We started off with drinks and I never saw a cocktail menu but the waitress was able to order everyone drinks they loved based on just a brief description of base drink preference (ie: gin, vodka, etc.)  The drinks are strong and tasty and while perhaps not as complex as the artisinal cocktails we had at Lab just before, they were good.  I had no idea how much they cost either.  Then we started off with appetizers.  She knew we were familiar with the famous Foie Gras double down but informed us they no longer sold it.  She saw our sad faces and said would order a selection that would make us happy.  Our waitress never pushed any item (ie: their oysters are famous, but we didn't feel like any) and it really was one of the most fun and engaging ordering experiences I've had.  Foie Gras Small Bites - deep fried and filled with tiny bits of foie gras and potato.  Delicious.  This place knows meat, fried, and smoked.Mozzarella served with Toast - fresh mozzarella cheese sliced and served with toast.  A nice change and balance to all the meat.Sunnyside up Duck Eggs with Pomme Frites - I've never had eggs this good and I've sous vide many eggs. This was better.  It was super rich, seasoned perfectly and the fries were amazing.Foie Gras And Ham Sandwich - this was to make up for the double down.  Split 6 ways, we each only got a small bite, but the salty foie gras sauce and milder ham went with the decant biscuit bread with sauce.  Puff Pastry with Smoked Turkey - our waitresses favorite appetizer.  It was good but tasted a bit like turkey with small bread puffs.  Not interesting enough.Minced Duck and Seared Foie Gras - the duck looked like a steak but broke into parts of duck meat.  The seared foie gras on top was delicious and the berry sauce was a perfect contrast.  Venison Sausage - loved it.  Did I say they do meats well?Lobster Spaghetti - another famous dish.  Whole lobster with cream sauce and perfect al dente noodles.  One of my favorites of the night.  Seared Rib Eye Steak - seasoned perfectly, cooked perfectly, finished completely.Horse Meat Filet Mignon - wrapped with bacon and served with potatoes.  This was a novelty as I've never had horse meat.  Cooked perfectly medium rare the meat was delicious and a very different texture than any meat I've had.  Worth trying once.  Deep Fried Cauliflower - covered in cheese but an obligatory vegetable.Lamb Steak - yet another meat, cooked so perfectly and completely different flavor.  Duck Fat Fries - the perfect starch to complement the meat.  We were too full from drink and food for dessert but finished our meal with laughter with the staff learning French phrases, sharing the best spots for food and merriment and finishing with shots on the house.  Our bill wasn't cheap but the final price was less than I guessed.  It also was one of the best meat meals I've had in my life.  I missed Au Pied du Cochon but I don't think I would have wanted to trade away Joe Beef.  Joe Beef accepts credit cards.A pure 5 star rating without a doubt in my mind. We came to Montreal to specifically go to Joe Beef and it was certainly worth it! Rated one of the most difficult places to get a reservation, we booked many moons ahead of time. Upon arrival, we noticed all the menu items were written on a chalk board. Having poor vision, combined with dimmed lighting, I opted to go with the chefs choice for 6 courses.  It relieved us of the stress of deciding what we should share while adding a layer of anticipation and surprise.  Out waiter was terrific as he attended multiple tables with his cat shirt in celebration of National Cat Day.Favorite dishes: bone marrow, calamari stuffed with meat in a red wine mushroom sauce and apple donuts with smoked Gouda.While everything was perfectly cooked, a bit too salty on some of the more savory items.  Just a general preference of mine, but it didn't stop me from eating everything!How many times have I come to Montreal and NOT eaten here???  This place is amazing!!!  Fish of the day for two: perfectly cooked white fish in a butter wine sauce with roe mixed in, served with a side of clams and little potatoes.  Horse filet mignon (unreal), tender, cooked medium rare, it was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  Served with mashed potatoes.  Duck dish topped with a piece of foie gras.  This came with a side of vegetable but I cannot recall at this point.Even the soft serve ice cream was yummy.  A refreshing end to a most decadent meal.  Everything was fantastic.  I would come back here in an instant.  I would recommend it to everyone!I loved everything about this restaurant.  The food, the service... it was the highlight of my weekend!This place is exceptionally good!Geez- I don't know where to begin. Our table of four shared about a dozen dishes. The highlights being the Horse Tartare, a pasta with Fois Gras and deer shoulder, the smoked crispy fried trout, and the New York Strip with blue cheese.The cocktails were kinda meh.......... but the service and general experience was all on point.I would visit Joe Beef again in a heartbeat. It's one of the best dining experiences I have had.If I have a Jen K's Top 10 Restaurant List, Joe Beef would definitely be on it. And in fact, I might even able to say My Last Meal on Earth I want to have it here. (Yelp's profile question and they do serves uni!)I have been to Liverpool House, Joe Beef's sister restaurant right next door but Joe Beef is the real deal.The menu is seasonal but interesting. A mixture of seafood and meat and even vegetables. And of course foie gras!Everything we ordered were amazing. And the wait staff is just so knowledgeable with the menu and able to make awesome recommendations.The vibe is relaxing especially out on the back patio on a nice summer evening. And of these for a reasonable price! Just make sure you make a reservation ASAP, Joe Beef is just so popular and definitely worth all the hype!Joe Beef is really freakin' good.  It's been about 2 months since I've eaten there while vacationing in Montreal and I still think fondly back on it.The menu rotates pretty often - but for what it's worth - we grabbed the whole flounder with lobster bisque gravy (came with a side of mussels and lobster cream sauced veggies), slow-cooked lamb neck with sausage, seared scallops and foie gras parfait.Other than the scallops (which was fresh and perfectly cooked, but definitely hard to break the mold), everything else was exceptional.  The weirdest thing was the foie gras parfait - which was raw foie gras whipped with egg yolks and paired with tart (rather than sweet) cherries and cherry jam.  It was very strange (seriously, foie for a 'dessert' appetizer) but it worked.  It came in a big bowl so whatever we didn't have on the bread was added as a topping to everything else.  I wish the lamb neck was a bit gamier, but still excellent.  Finally, the flounder was spectacular.Service was excellent.  We were immediately seated after confirming our reservation (if you are planning a trip - do make reservations well in advance).  The service was atypical - friendly but very relaxed.  The menu board is extremely difficult for non-French speakers to read due to the dim lights.  Our waiter just told us he recommended 'everything' but was very knowledgeable, answered all our questions and gauged our appetites well as he told us to stop ordering as he was confident we had 'more than enough' food and he was right.  He really steered us to configure an optimal meal that satisfied everyone at the table considering some unique dietary restrictions.Also, the meal was surprisingly affordable.  With everything mentioned and two beers, the bill came to $65 each for the four of us - tax and tip included.Easily the best restaurant I've been to in Canada.Did not live up to the hype for me: *the smoked meat croquettes were little salt bombs and a bit one note for me.  The sliced pickles just added to the sodium.*seemed dingy inside and there were flies in the restaurant, but thought all the knick knacks strewn throughout were nice photo ops*the horse tartare is phenomenal, loved the shaved matsutakes and the brioche, heavenly.  Best red meat tartare I have ever had.  *if you must get the lobster pasta, get the half portion, it was just okay, pasta al dente, the shellfish could have been better, heavy, creamy, could have used more fresh herbs and again, a lot of the same flavor*veal, escargot and bone marrow, impressive looking dish and was more like short rib type meat than a steak-just falls apart.  Very good and very rich.  Tip: take a photo of the chalkboard and read the menu from your device.  Everyone was struggling and craning their necks.  It's been rather warm the last week, no AC at JB.  Loved our little window nook booth, but I think the garden would have been a great alternative.Reasonable pricing $160 CAD for 4 items, 2 glasses of wine, tax and tip.  We were stuffed.  Great servers and interesting meal, but my least favorite planned meal of the trip.This is my second favorite restaurant in Montreal, ranked only below it's sister restaurant, Liverpool House. Before I get into my review, first, a confession. I came here, too, because of Anthony Bordain. I am not proud of it, I wish I was a cool-kid Montreal-er, but alas I am merely a uni-lingual American.  In fact, my boyfriend and I designed a whole vacation around getting a reservation at Joe Beef. The atmosphere: Joe Beef is simultaneously sexy and casual. It has dark mood lighting, but hockey memorabilia decor. They play Neil Young and French singers I do not recognize. Your plates and glasses are mismatched, and appear to come from a cool thrift store. The bar is boisterous-  ladies cackling, men singing, loud debates amounting, etc. ( an example from our dinner: whether Americans are bigger prudes than Canadians). The staff are irreverent and knowledgeable. Almost all of them seem to have a gleam of mischievous in their eyes. The Food: I ordered some sort of lamb sausage plate, the cocktail of the day (x3), and PEI oysters. My other half ordered the pheasant and wine. We were both very happy. If I had to describe the food, I'd say it was decedent,and intense. My lamb dish was so huge, it presented like a dare. It wasn't prepared like your usual lamb, in that it was not Mediterranean inspired. It actually reminded me a lot of the food I ate in Prague - made to keep you full and warm. It had a dark aroma - of spices I did not recognize but enjoyed. The Oysters were meaty and briny, and served with a very spicy homemade hot sauce. The star of our night was desert, Marjolaine (a painstaking, many-layered chocolate and hazelnut cake). It was the best desert I've ever had in my life. For those Anthony Bordain fans morjolaine was featured in the No Reservations, Quebec episode. There is also a recipe for it in Joe Beef's cookbook. Anyways, making a pilgrimage to Joe Beef should definitely be on any foodie's vacation itinerary. The food, atmosphere, and service were wonderful. I felt right at home in my comfy booth, tearing through animal parts and slogging beer.Food 5 / 5 decor 5 / 5 service 5 / 5 We were 4, made reservations 2 months prior. Everything about the experience was perfection, one of the best part of joe beef is that you get top notch quality without the snootiness. You can get there in a suit, or in sweats, it won't matter because everyone is there for one reason: hearty, meaty, and delicious cuisine du terroir. The staff knows the food inside out as if they've cooked everything themselves.1. Smoked trout 26$2. Duck terrine 17$3. Large pulled pork with butternut squash gnocchis (regular 27$ large 40.50$) 4. Roasted Fowl 66$5. Side of bone marrow 16$6. Order of fries with parmesan flakes 8$7. Pear pie with housemade Pear and clove ice cream 16$+ 2 bottles of wine (white 65$ and red 65$)+ 3 coffees (3$ each)Everything above was shared. With tax and a 15% tip our total was 435$. For me, the pulled pork stole the show,  it's as if the meat just melted in your mouth, it was so tender. And the ice cream I would buy by the gallon if I could.It's been a while since I wrote a review but I've been busy enjoying life.  Anyways, here goes a review of a highly recommended restaurant I went in Montreal earlier this month.  I came with a friend I haven't seen since college so needless to say, there was a lot we had to catch up on.The setting is quite intimate but it didn't hinder a good conversation.  What we didn't like was the menu.  It is a blackboard hung up high in the wall and written in French only.  The handwriting was like a doctor's prescription and the blackboard was not properly erased so it made reading the menu immensely difficult (not to mention I didn't bring my glasses or read French).I thought the service was ok.  My friend thought our server was a little pretentious.  Anyhow, at least they offered to sell me a half portion of their famous lobster spaghetti.  That allowed me to enjoy some oysters and Canadian sea urchin (uni) as appetizer.  It would be too much food otherwise.  Taste-wise, everything was on par and predictable.It is a pricey place so do save it for a special occasion.  Reservation necessary.As I watched our cheerful server patiently (and entertainingly) translate the French-language menu in its entirety, I was at first dubious, then astonished, and finally delighted.  It was a glimpse into the workings of an establishment of humble origins that has gained acclaim as one of Canada's premier restaurants.The service here is genuinely welcoming.  I am reminded of the graciousness that defines hospitality at a Danny Meyer restaurant.  Without hovering, our servers were there when needed.  From a fine wine list dominated by bottles in the triple digits, our server swiftly ascertained our preference for a lower end choice, then narrowed down a flavor profile in just a brief, bantering exchange.  It was near worth ordering a second bottle for.An argument can be made for two bottles.  Although renowned as a meat-centric restaurant, Joe Beef is equally at ease with seafood, so a sampling of both is reasonable.  One of their more impressive starters were two whole, small trout showered with seasonally fresh vegetables.  The tender meat is gently smoked, yielding a flavor that is surprisingly restrained: enough to accent, not enough to dominate.  Shellfish shined in an equally wonderful sausage of lobster and clams; plump, juicy, and brimming with the flavors of its ingredients.  If the starter menu isn't enough, a few quality, local raw bar options are offered.  Raw oysters are de rigueur, but more interesting was a fresh uni prepared in a light tomato sauce and served in its shell, or the sweet snow crab legs.Of course, it would be sinful to eschew meat at Joe Beef, which offers up a few sharable beef entrees, along with foie gras, Canadian smoked meat, duck, rabbit, horse, lamb, and chicken dishes.  Foie gras parfait is flawless; creamy and luxurious, perfectly offset by a bite of crisp, sharp radish on warm, crusty brioche.  The same brioche is molded like a nest around smooth horse tartare, although robust seasoning muffled the sweetness of raw horse.  Simple, expertly cooked duck breast was a marvel of flavor and succulence.It is easy to see how this utterly charming restaurant is as famed as it is.  It is not for a specific dish, gimmick, or personality.  With its constantly changing menu penned only on chalkboard, Joe Beef announces its allegiance to local, seasonal foods, and prepares them exceptionally well.  Add to that the warmth of the staff and a uniquely home-like atmosphere between its cozy, tavern-like space inside and a festive outdoor area reminiscent of a patio.  It makes for a highly enjoyable, low-key dining experience that seems effortless in execution yet must surely be anything but.  And it will have one thinking about a return visit as soon as possible.I LOVED our waitress! She was so friendly and down-to-earth. - I made my reservations 3 months in advance (that's the earliest you can make it) - It's a dimly-lit, tiny restaurant, very homey and intimate - They played some great music while we were there (biggie smalls and some frenchy music)- The menu is written on the chalkboard (behind people sitting in the restaurant) - just take a picture with your smart phone and look at the menu from your seat instead of cranking your neck around and struggling to read it - The waitress encourages you to get up from your seat to look at the menu and she can answer any questions or give you recommendations - Duck for 2 ($90) is HUGE and worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It comes with 2 pieces of foie gras and a duck leg (confit), and like a whole freakin duck. It was SO good. We couldn't finish and I was really sad. HUGE portions. - Corn chowder was delicious too - For dessert, I picked ice cream with concord grapes - it was very good. - I also got to pick at my neighbor's cake (we became friends after sitting so close for 2 hours) - 12 layers of buttercream As with any other French restaurants in Montreal, your meal will probably last 2 hours or longer.We were able to get a last minute reservation here the day of for 9ish. We thought we had lucked out. In some ways we did, in some ways we didn't.  It was a great meal but it was crazy expensive. I was under the impression that this place was small but it has expanded to a full rowhouse so capacity was not a problem. Couples shuffled in and out and there were 1 or 2 empty tables near us the entire time. It was kind of cramped as we were crammed in there. We were seated at a 2 top between 2 couples in the back. Our server was lovely and gave us great choices. It was so dark in there and the writing on the board is so narrow and squiggly there is no way you can see the board so you are completely at the server's mercy when it comes to food and wine choices. The choices she gave us was excellent tho but the prices were tremendously inflated. We got a CAD $110 bottle of wine which I found out on the internet was really a USD $38 bottle of wine so I guess it was the standard markup. We had a Great froie gras appetizer and I had the blue cheese rabbit while hubby had a steak that came overcooked. The server asked him about it and he said it was ok but she took the liberty of sending it back and giving him a rare one instead. I didn't know this at the time but for the prices we were about to pay, it was par for the course. His new steak took a while to come. So 2 bottles of wine, 1 appetizer and 2 main courses, 1 salad and a fruit dessert set us back  400 CAD.  It was about 14 CAD for a side salad add on and similar for a berries dessert with cream. They did give us a small complimentary tasting of another wine for the steak mishap. So...it was good but I'm not sure if it was $400 good. I LOVE French Canadian food and have eaten my way through Quebec City on two occasions not having paid nearly as much in a couple of days than what we did tonight. To make myself feel better, I just looked up the exchange rate so the meal was about 300 USD which sits a lot better in my stomach. Still, Joe Beef is kind of overrated but I'm glad we did it. If we were to come back, I'd definitely only have 1 bottle of wine, and skip the expensive extras like dessert and salad.After an anxious six week wait, the night finally came for dinner at Joe Beef! Pros:1. Service is impeccable. All of the staff is very knowledgeable, in-tune with the menu and attentive to allergies. They checked back at just the right frequency. No complaints at all here. 2. Food is definitely above average. Snow crab legs were incredible -- As our server said, they are in season right now so they were very sweet and didn't even need condiments. The lamb sausage was a tad too salty in my opinion and could have used more starch or veggie on the side to balance that out. The strip steak was flavourful but a little more tough than expected. The fries were cute in a mini Creuset but pretty standard in terms of taste. Cons: 1. Menu is only in French and on the blackboard. Being fully bilingual, I didn't mind at all that the menu was in French. More importantly, I just don't think it is practical to have the only version of the menu on the single blackboard that half the restaurant has their back up against. The ONLY thing that partially made up for it was the detail-oriented servers who could cater to individual questions. It just seemed like a bit of a drag for the server to repeat the menu so many times. 2. In terms of value, sad to say that Joe Beef didn't live up to the hype this time. I'm all about paying good money for dinner but we both agreed that the meal just didn't live up to the long wait for reservations and the price.To try next time: - Lobster spaghetti - Rib steak for 2Lives up to the hype. Other than my appetizer being a little over seasoned (fresh pasta with venison), I only have good things to say. Our waitress did an excellent job guiding us through a somewhat cryptic menu on the chalk board and the end result was a memorable three course dinner. The next time a friend from out of town asks me where they should eat when they come to Montreal, I'll probably tell them to go to Joe Beef.Oh my God, Yumm!My Buddy had been frothing at the mouth to come up to Montreal and try this spot. Wouldn't stop talking about it, ha ha.So we did.We started with the Horse Tar Tar, and tell you the truth, with enough of it, that could have been my meal, it was soooooo goooooood!He had the steak, I had the lamb.  The lamb was good, not great.  His steak was to die for. For sure I will be back and have the steak.Tip: the servers in Canada are quite honest about what's good and tasty on the menu, so if they suggest anything, go for it! We almost balked at the horse tar tar, and it ended up being other-wordly!A good restaurant, but not a great one at the time of my visit.We were able to squeeze in a reservation for two at the bar, and were very excited given all the hype this restaurant has. But it just didn't meet those expectations for me. We each had a glass of wine, then followed with the local buffalo mozzarella appetizer which came with 2 slivers of fish and 2 slices of rye toast. The cheese was lovely, but nothing to write home about; it's fresh mozzarella? Next we had the smoked meat croquettes which were really good, easily the highlight of the meal -- it's everything you love about smoked meat squished up into a little tater-tot sized bite with a pickle on top. For entrees, we split the gentleman's steak with bleu cheese and while it was extremely well cooked (rare) it was really pricey for what amounted to a properly cooked steak with a scoop of garlic spinach on the side. However the portion is huge, so if you split it between two it's actually pretty reasonable. For dessert we had the strawberry and pistachio gratin, which was hyped up a lot by the bar staff. The berries were too early to be flavorful so they macerated them in sugar to increase the flavor. The creamy pistachio flan was amazing though! In all, it was a meal with highs (pistachio flan in the strawberry dessert & smoked meat croquettes) and okay points. For a restaurant of it's reputation, we expected more. The ambiance is great, the staff is helpful, but if you're and english speaker you're out of luck -- the menu is in french and only written on one chalkboard. Thankfully I speak french and was able to get by, but I can see how it's hard for others.Great place, note that the menu is 100% in French.One of the single best meals I've ever had. I know it either had to be amazing or grossly overrated as we made reservations 2.5 months in advance and could only score a table at 10PM on a Thursday evening. Needless to say, I had very high expectations for Joe Beef and JB graciously blew those expectations out of the water. The whole menu is in French on a chalkboard on the wall. Luckily, I picked up some French in High School and College and was able to navigate our nosh options well enough. If French wasn't your thang in school then the waiters will give ya a hand with the translation. We also did our homework and mostly knew what we wanted. The goods: We ordered some of the house pickles along with some of their housemade sourdough with butter which were a delicious beginning to the meal. Next was the sliced ham with mushrooms. I have to say this was one of the best bites of food I have ever had the pleasure of consuming. The ham was so wonderfully soft and fresh. The mushrooms were exploding with flavor and then there was a drizzle of a light cream sauce over top. This dish was absolutely divine. Next came the Lobster Spaghetti. If you think you're too old for spaghetti, get over it and order this right now! GIant chunks of lobster + claws served in a heavy cream sauce with over spaghetti. It was so heavy, but worth every artery clogging bite!For dessert we ordered a Strawberry dish that was absolutely incredible. The Strawberries are shipped down from a farm just north of Montreal and they were so amazingly tart, tangy, and fresh. It made me feel as if I had never tasted a strawberry before and I was tasting them for the first time. Yes, sounds exaggerated but it was that good! Our waiter Patrick was absolutely wonderful! He was great on offering suggestions (we asked him to suggest the appetizer for us). He was hysterical, kind, and super quirky.   Perfect meal in the heart of Little Burgundy.Come here prepared to for meat and calorie overload!  But it is exceptionally good and the service was remarkable.  Very simply if you're traveling to the Montreal area you have to go to Joe Beef.  Oh, but plan ahead, they were booked 2 months in advance.
