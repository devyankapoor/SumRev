I went here with my group of friends and I can say with confidence that this place delivers in terms of food and service.The interior of this place is very cute and I enjoyed the ambiance a lot. Great music, great staff.I sampled a lot of my friend's plates as well and I thought that each entree was balanced so well in terms of flavour and also had big portions for the price, especially for French bistro food. I have a big appetite and this place left me very full. The salmon tartare was delicately seasoned and the beef tartare was complemented nicely wish fresh greens. It is so rare to see such fresh greens as garnish in Toronto. For dessert, there was creme brulee (it's very big!) and the flambed pineapples. The pineapples tasted heavily of alcohol, which may be a plus for some.Overall, very satisfied with my experience.One more star for the attention taken by the restaurant to address my issue and reply to my comment. I appreciate that level of customer service. I was really looking forward to this place after reading all the great Yelp reviews. What a disappointment! The service was rushed and impersonal, the dishes SO average (my steak was severely overcooked and came with cooked lettuce that was completely flavorless). We had dinner in less than 20 minutes and it felt that the staff was more concerned by turning tables than providing a memorable experience.My Order: Duck Confit (delicious)Pros+ FOOD: very delicious. While I'm not surprised that the serving was so small (it's french food after all), the duck was quite moist and delicious. + PATIO: the doors to the restaurant were large and open which allowed for the enjoyment of the great weather despite being situated in doors. Cons- W/R: only one per sex. The design of the washroom was inconvenient as the water from the sink was so close to the sink that you couldn't wash your hands without touching the sink's surface (which only serves to make your hands dirty as opposed to cleaner).- SERVICE: the waiter gave me the dirtiest look when I decided to skip an app and opt for an entree and a drink instead. Excuse me? For the premium prices that I'm paying, the least I should come to expect is top notch service (-2 points). We also would've wanted split bills but it comes as no surprise that the waiter didn't ask before handing us our bill. tl;dr? good food. shitty service.I really liked this place. We booked the thanksgiving diner pre fix. The meal was great and so was the wine pairing. The only thing that was missing was the cranberry sauce. The chef made a beet and apple sauce which was good but not the same. Everything else was terrific. I especially liked the pumpkin pie which was made in a tart crust and was especially thin.This place was surprisingly good. It is a touristy restaurant and I'm not sure how often it is frequented by the real Montrealers. Having lived here for about a year, however, I would say that it's just as good as the other local gems of the city.The service was spotty. We ordered the warm goat cheese salad, duck confit and sea bass as our main entrees. All super delicious and rich. For dessert we had their bread pudding, which was essentially a deconstructed pain au chocolat. Very delicious.My favorite meal in Montreal. This is the place to go if you're looking for authentic French-style cuisine. Service was wonderful and I got a French lesson, too--which is  hugely important when you're learning the language.One of the best meals we had while we were in Montreal. That lamb shank...oh my. Let me tell ya, I was holding myself back from picking it up and gnawing the meat right off of the bone. So tender and flavorful. And it was HUGE! I mean, look at that pic! Of course, I finished every last bite. (Gotta pad that muffin top.) b. enjoyed her duck confit, which was also cooked very well and came in a large portion too. The sauce made a nice pairing - complemented the meat without overpowering it. But in the end, I think my lamb shank KO'ed b's duck, hands down. Our appetizer, the foie gras, was okay, nothing special. But we also had no idea what "au torchon" meant when we ordered it so maybe our expectations were off. We probably would have done better with the beef tartare, which looked pretty good from the looks of the table next to us, but we were pretty meat-ed out by that point in our trip.Service was friendly enough. When we arrived early for dinner, I asked our waiter whether we could be seated on the second floor in front of the open balcony. In typical French form, he responded with a short but polite, "No, is impossible." This tickled us. Oh, if only I had a French accent.Had high hopes for this place after seeing such good reviews. Overall, an ok restaurant but not up to a 4 or 5 stars we saw. Service was solid, ambiance was adorable and the food was....ok.The setting on cute Prince Arthur pedestrian way is like having a slice of Paris in this section of Montreal.    The chairs and the tables facing the street are very much Parisian. The service is good with waiters speaking basic English.   The complementary bread was crispy on the edges, warm and soft in the center. I had the duck confit and it was delicious....the sauce was tangy and sweet, the meat was moist, tender and just devine.   My BF got the hanger steak and it was good, but a bit chewy.  Also for about $25, that beef was only about 4 oz....very small.   Otherwise a nice cool dining experience in Montreal.Very cute restaurant, and they offer outdoor seating as well! My sister and I had come here for a late dinner (~9:30), so they had already run out of several options for main courses, including the lamb shank (which I had been eyeing), and the duck ravioli (which my sister had been contemplating). My sister ended up getting the beef tartare with a side of fries and salad, and I opted for the sea bass on a bed of quinoa, and we had the torchon de foie gras to start. They also serve complimentary bread !The foie gras was good, but we both haven't had foie gras often enough to tell whether it was amazing. The mains were both really good though! My sister really enjoyed her beef tartare, and my sea bass was delicious as well, and the quinoa was super flavorful. At the end of our meal, we were both stuffed, but decided to share a dessert. We got the pineapples with sugar on top, which was doused in rum. It was really cool, because our server, Simon, brought the rum to our table, and lit it on fire in front of us! Super super cool! Overall, it was a great dining experience - the food was really tasty, the service was really good and friendly, and I really like the outdoor patio! Will definitely come back again (at an earlier time) to try their other menu items!Good food absolutely crappy service.  We didn't get the waiter to come by for half an hour.   We had to wait a half hour for drinks and bread after putting in  the order.   We had to ask,  after almost finishing dinner for two dishes.   Our waiter was so bad that two other waitresses had to step up and replenish bread,  water  and provide desert.   But he was very attentive when it came time to leave ands tip.  On to the food.   The food overall was good to very good,  with the gnocchi in a foie gras sauce outstanding, light fluffy with a satisfying foie gras flavor. I personally found some of the food to be slightly underseasoned, but the rest of my party thought things were ok. Salmon tartar was fresh and flavorful.  Foie gras was rich and well prepared.Easily a four star with a decent server.YES! Just YES! Love this place, must try if you are in Montreal! Amazing food, well done, good proportions. Friendly and knowledgeable service. Wine was great too!Great and affordable French bistro eats...in the heart of Montreal!Rus and I made reservations to dine here, and were greeted with extremely courteous service throughout the entirety of our meal.We ordered the french onion soup, beef tartare, duck confit and braised lamb shank. After ordering, the hostess walked us through the wine list and helped us choose something that would pair well with our meal. Wines by the glass were also very affordable (most of the options were under $10CAD/glass).The food was great! The french onion soup was rich and delicious. A bit on the breadier side, but I still enjoyed it very much. Rus also enjoyed the beef tartare. It came with fried capers, which I had never seen before (but they were delicious)!Our entrees were so good! I love the duck confit and the lamb shank was also very rich. The portions were pretty large, but so good that we just couldn't stop eating.We ended our meal with the creme brulee dessert (free with Yelp check-in), it was eh...but I won't complain about a free dessert (maybe spring for the bread pudding though)!Les Deux Gamins is perfect for a date-night outing. The ambience is perfect and the staff will make sure that you have a great experience.Good wine list, which is not a difficult thing to do in Montreal.First course--torchon de foie gras, nicely done.Mesclun salads were fresh.Main course--where it counts--we swear that the "monkfish" special was sea bass.  Not bad, but not great.  False advertising, in my opinion.Confit de Canard was old, tired, and had skin the consistency of a limp dishrag, not crispy as it should be.  Server asked how it was, and I complained.  No acknowledgement of the complaint, not even a slight apology.  By the way, I did NOT finish my plate, which is rare.  What is the purpose of asking the customer how dinner is, if nothing is done?We did not bother with dessert after that.  My opinion is that you should not bother with this restaurant.  I imagine that my opinion will not matter, though, because they are in a good location, and attract plenty of business.  We will not be dining here on our next visit to Montreal.This was our second time at Les Deux Gamins - we always try to include one French place on our trip.  Food-wise, the experience was consistent with last time.  This time around, I got the foie gras to start, and lamb shank for main dish - she got the goat cheese salad and steak.  Most notably, they give very large portions here for French cuisine (which is a good thing, some places sacrifice substance for presentation) - I was completely stuffed by lamb at the end of the meal.  The meat was also very tender, especially for lamb which can be tough at some places.  I think they could downsize the meat and upsize the accompaniment a bit, but really just a minor complaint.Service wise everyone was very friendly.  I do have to say, it was a 100% different experience coming here in the summer vs the winter.  In the winter we were probably 1 of 4 couples in the entire place, seated by a cozy fire.  In the summer this time around, the place was jammed pack, and even with a reservation we got seated indoors (there is a large outdoor area).  However, we were still close to the window and most importantly, the service didn't seem to suffer too much from this. Great place overall.Oh my my my - C'est FANTASTIQUE in absolutely every way possible! Started with an appetizer of the escargot (snails) du jour - which they described as "SPANISH style" but really it was sautéed snails with spinach and truffle oil & balsamic vinaigrette, the most amazing appetizer that I've ever had....probably in my life. We also had the Beef Tartare - superb - absolutely a delicious start to our meal.Then for our entrees we ordered the Duck Confit, Flank Steak & the Lamb Shank in Whiskey BBQ sauce. ALL 3 were absolutely amazingly delicious but the Lamb Shank wins the competition! Mind blowing sauce and the tender lamb fell off the bone just by touching it.All around - one of the most amazing meals that we had in Montreal - highly recommend!!!!!Classic Bistro.  Classic items on a small menu.  Food was decent, good portions and quality was fine.  The waiter and his service is poor.  His greeting was friendly but after taking our order he never looked at is again.  Never came to see if everything was ok, if we would want more wine/ water.  Finished our food and took a good 15min to clear dishes, which the bus girl did.  She brought our food, checked if we were ok, cleared our dishes and took our dessert order, all the while the waiter was around us talking and serving the tables next to us but would ignore us.  Poor bus girl was rushing around trying to cover her job and his job along with those huge party happening upstairs.  He would get 1 or 2 stars.  :-(I'm always nervous when friends warn me that the restaurant were going to is relatively un-vegetarian friendly. Sometimes, though, that's where real gems of dishes for us herbivores can be found! Such was the case at Les Deux Gamins, where besides a delicious bottle of rosé, I enjoyed:  Frites/French Fries ($4): Everything I ever craved was in these fries. Julienne cut, salty, crispy on the outside, melt-in-your-mouth fluffy on the inside, and dredged through whatever that dangerously delicious white sauce was (I don't want to know what's in it, do I?)? I probably could have just eaten baskets of these all.night.long. with endless glasses of wine and been entirely satisfied.Salade de chèvre chaud et noix de Grenoble/Warm goat cheese and walnut salad (16.50): This was one of the lone options I had for my entree choices, and it was grand. A heaping mound of greens with a walnut dusting and four sizable slices of toast each covered with a thick slab of goat cheese (and did I taste a hint of honey on it, too?). Yes, please! The goat cheese was beyond plentiful and generous, too, more than I've ever seen at a restaurant before... so if you like cheese... and you're a vegetarian... I promise, you will not go hungry with this option (also, be sure to have more rosé to wash each bite down with as goat cheese itself can be very dry in the most amazing of ways). So despite the lack of choices, would I come back here again? Absolutely. Sitting outside right on Prince Arthur does, as another reviewer mentioned, feel very much like Europe. It helped that a gentleman showed up to play French music for a spell, that the young girls next to us were excitedly talking about their backpacking trip, that the waitstaff was attentive, that my company was lovely, the weather was perfect, and that the rosé was divine after a long day of flying. Couldn't have had a more "just right" dinner my first night in Montreal!Very nice place to have dinner! The food are so yummy and ppl are friendly! Be sure will come back! The waiter Simon did great job! Hope next time still can server by him.We ordered beef tartare, duck confit and braised lamb shank as recommended by the waiter and they were all so delicious! The restaurant was quite busy when we were there, but the waiter did try his best to pay attention to all of us and provide great service. Would totally recommend this place ~~I went here with my group of friends and I can say with confidence that this place delivers in terms of food and service.The interior of this place is very cute and I enjoyed the ambiance a lot.

I had the duck confit and it was delicious....the sauce was tangy and sweet, the meat was moist, tender and just devine.   My BF got the hanger steak and it was good, but a bit chewy.  Also for about $25, that beef was only about 4 oz....very small.   Otherwise a nice cool dining experience in Montreal.Very cute restaurant, and they offer outdoor seating as well! My sister and I had come here for a late dinner (~9:30), so they had already run out of several options for main courses, including the lamb shank (which I had been eyeing), and the duck ravioli (which my sister had been contemplating). My sister ended up getting the beef tartare with a side of fries and salad, and I opted for the sea bass on a bed of quinoa, and we had the torchon de foie gras to start. They also serve complimentary bread !The foie gras was good, but we both haven't had foie gras often enough to tell whether it was amazing. The mains were both really good though! My sister really enjoyed her beef tartare, and my sea bass was delicious as well, and the quinoa was super flavorful. At the end of our meal, we were both stuffed, but decided to share a dessert. We got the pineapples with sugar on top, which was doused in rum. It was really cool, because our server, Simon, brought the rum to our table, and lit it on fire in front of us! Super super cool! Overall, it was a great dining experience - the food was really tasty, the service was really good and friendly, and I really like the outdoor patio! Will definitely come back again (at an earlier time) to try their other menu items!Good food absolutely crappy service.  We didn't get the waiter to come by for half an hour.   We had to wait a half hour for drinks and bread after putting in  the order.   We had to ask,  after almost finishing dinner for two dishes.   Our waiter was so bad that two other waitresses had to step up and replenish bread,  water  and provide desert.   But he was very attentive when it came time to leave ands tip.  On to the food.   The food overall was good to very good,  with the gnocchi in a foie gras sauce outstanding, light fluffy with a satisfying foie gras flavor. I personally found some of the food to be slightly underseasoned, but the rest of my party thought things were ok. Salmon tartar was fresh and flavorful.  Foie gras was rich and well prepared.Easily a four star with a decent server.YES! Just YES! Love this place, must try if you are in Montreal! Amazing food, well done, good proportions. Friendly and knowledgeable service. Wine was great too!Great and affordable French bistro eats...in the heart of Montreal!Rus and I made reservations to dine here, and were greeted with extremely courteous service throughout the entirety of our meal.We ordered the french onion soup, beef tartare, duck confit and braised lamb shank. After ordering, the hostess walked us through the wine list and helped us choose something that would pair well with our meal. Wines by the glass were also very affordable (most of the options were under $10CAD/glass).The food was great! The french onion soup was rich and delicious. A bit on the breadier side, but I still enjoyed it very much. Rus also enjoyed the beef tartare. It came with fried capers, which I had never seen before (but they were delicious)!Our entrees were so good! I love the duck confit and the lamb shank was also very rich. The portions were pretty large, but so good that we just couldn't stop eating.We ended our meal with the creme brulee dessert (free with Yelp check-in), it was eh...but I won't complain about a free dessert (maybe spring for the bread pudding though)!Les Deux Gamins is perfect for a date-night outing. The ambience is perfect and the staff will make sure that you have a great experience.Good wine list, which is not a difficult thing to do in Montreal.First course--torchon de foie gras, nicely done.Mesclun salads were fresh.Main course--where it counts--we swear that the "monkfish" special was sea bass.  Not bad, but not great.  False advertising, in my opinion.Confit de Canard was old, tired, and had skin the consistency of a limp dishrag, not crispy as it should be.  Server asked how it was, and I complained.  No acknowledgement of the complaint, not even a slight apology.  By the way, I did NOT finish my plate, which is rare.  What is the purpose of asking the customer how dinner is, if nothing is done?We did not bother with dessert after that.  My opinion is that you should not bother with this restaurant.  I imagine that my opinion will not matter, though, because they are in a good location, and attract plenty of business.  We will not be dining here on our next visit to Montreal.This was our second time at Les Deux Gamins - we always try to include one French place on our trip.  Food-wise, the experience was consistent with last time.  This time around, I got the foie gras to start, and lamb shank for main dish - she got the goat cheese salad and steak.  Most notably, they give very large portions here for French cuisine (which is a good thing, some places sacrifice substance for presentation) - I was completely stuffed by lamb at the end of the meal.  The meat was also very tender, especially for lamb which can be tough at some places.  I think they could downsize the meat and upsize the accompaniment a bit, but really just a minor complaint.Service wise everyone was very friendly.  I do have to say, it was a 100% different experience coming here in the summer vs the winter.  In the winter we were probably 1 of 4 couples in the entire place, seated by a cozy fire.  In the summer this time around, the place was jammed pack, and even with a reservation we got seated indoors (there is a large outdoor area).  However, we were still close to the window and most importantly, the service didn't seem to suffer too much from this. Great place overall.Oh my my my - C'est FANTASTIQUE in absolutely every way possible! Started with an appetizer of the escargot (snails) du jour - which they described as "SPANISH style" but really it was sautéed snails with spinach and truffle oil & balsamic vinaigrette, the most amazing appetizer that I've ever had....probably in my life. We also had the Beef Tartare - superb - absolutely a delicious start to our meal.Then for our entrees we ordered the Duck Confit, Flank Steak & the Lamb Shank in Whiskey BBQ sauce. ALL 3 were absolutely amazingly delicious but the Lamb Shank wins the competition! Mind blowing sauce and the tender lamb fell off the bone just by touching it.All around - one of the most amazing meals that we had in Montreal - highly recommend!!!!!Classic Bistro.  Classic items on a small menu.  Food was decent, good portions and quality was fine.  The waiter and his service is poor.  His greeting was friendly but after taking our order he never looked at is again.  Never came to see if everything was ok, if we would want more wine/ water.  Finished our food and took a good 15min to clear dishes, which the bus girl did.  She brought our food, checked if we were ok, cleared our dishes and took our dessert order, all the while the waiter was around us talking and serving the tables next to us but would ignore us.  Poor bus girl was rushing around trying to cover her job and his job along with those huge party happening upstairs.  He would get 1 or 2 stars.  :-(I'm always nervous when friends warn me that the restaurant were going to is relatively un-vegetarian friendly. Sometimes, though, that's where real gems of dishes for us herbivores can be found! Such was the case at Les Deux Gamins, where besides a delicious bottle of rosé, I enjoyed:  Frites/French Fries ($4): Everything I ever craved was in these fries. Julienne cut, salty, crispy on the outside, melt-in-your-mouth fluffy on the inside, and dredged through whatever that dangerously delicious white sauce was (I don't want to know what's in it, do I?)? I probably could have just eaten baskets of these all.night.long. with endless glasses of wine and been entirely satisfied.Salade de chèvre chaud et noix de Grenoble/Warm goat cheese and walnut salad (16.50): This was one of the lone options I had for my entree choices, and it was grand. A heaping mound of greens with a walnut dusting and four sizable slices of toast each covered with a thick slab of goat cheese (and did I taste a hint of honey on it, too?). Yes, please! The goat cheese was beyond plentiful and generous, too, more than I've ever seen at a restaurant before... so if you like cheese... and you're a vegetarian... I promise, you will not go hungry with this option (also, be sure to have more rosé to wash each bite down with as goat cheese itself can be very dry in the most amazing of ways). So despite the lack of choices, would I come back here again? Absolutely. Sitting outside right on Prince Arthur does, as another reviewer mentioned, feel very much like Europe. It helped that a gentleman showed up to play French music for a spell, that the young girls next to us were excitedly talking about their backpacking trip, that the waitstaff was attentive, that my company was lovely, the weather was perfect, and that the rosé was divine after a long day of flying. Couldn't have had a more "just right" dinner my first night in Montreal!Very nice place to have dinner! The food are so yummy and ppl are friendly! Be sure will come back! The waiter Simon did great job! Hope next time still can server by him.We ordered beef tartare, duck confit and braised lamb shank as recommended by the waiter and they were all so delicious! The restaurant was quite busy when we were there, but the waiter did try his best to pay attention to all of us and provide great service. Would totally recommend this place ~~I went here with my group of friends and I can say with confidence that this place delivers in terms of food and service.The interior of this place is very cute and I enjoyed the ambiance a lot. Great music, great staff.I sampled a lot of my friend's plates as well and I thought that each entree was balanced so well in terms of flavour and also had big portions for the price, especially for French bistro food. I have a big appetite and this place left me very full. The salmon tartare was delicately seasoned and the beef tartare was complemented nicely wish fresh greens. It is so rare to see such fresh greens as garnish in Toronto. For dessert, there was creme brulee (it's very big!) and the flambed pineapples. The pineapples tasted heavily of alcohol, which may be a plus for some.Overall, very satisfied with my experience.One more star for the attention taken by the restaurant to address my issue and reply to my comment. I appreciate that level of customer service. I was really looking forward to this place after reading all the great Yelp reviews. What a disappointment! The service was rushed and impersonal, the dishes SO average (my steak was severely overcooked and came with cooked lettuce that was completely flavorless). We had dinner in less than 20 minutes and it felt that the staff was more concerned by turning tables than providing a memorable experience.My Order: Duck Confit (delicious)Pros+ FOOD: very delicious. While I'm not surprised that the serving was so small (it's french food after all), the duck was quite moist and delicious. + PATIO: the doors to the restaurant were large and open which allowed for the enjoyment of the great weather despite being situated in doors. Cons- W/R: only one per sex. The design of the washroom was inconvenient as the water from the sink was so close to the sink that you couldn't wash your hands without touching the sink's surface (which only serves to make your hands dirty as opposed to cleaner).- SERVICE: the waiter gave me the dirtiest look when I decided to skip an app and opt for an entree and a drink instead. Excuse me? For the premium prices that I'm paying, the least I should come to expect is top notch service (-2 points). We also would've wanted split bills but it comes as no surprise that the waiter didn't ask before handing us our bill. tl;dr? good food. shitty service.I really liked this place. We booked the thanksgiving diner pre fix. The meal was great and so was the wine pairing. The only thing that was missing was the cranberry sauce. The chef made a beet and apple sauce which was good but not the same. Everything else was terrific. I especially liked the pumpkin pie which was made in a tart crust and was especially thin.This place was surprisingly good. It is a touristy restaurant and I'm not sure how often it is frequented by the real Montrealers. Having lived here for about a year, however, I would say that it's just as good as the other local gems of the city.The service was spotty. We ordered the warm goat cheese salad, duck confit and sea bass as our main entrees. All super delicious and rich. For dessert we had their bread pudding, which was essentially a deconstructed pain au chocolat. Very delicious.My favorite meal in Montreal. This is the place to go if you're looking for authentic French-style cuisine. Service was wonderful and I got a French lesson, too--which is  hugely important when you're learning the language.One of the best meals we had while we were in Montreal. That lamb shank...oh my. Let me tell ya, I was holding myself back from picking it up and gnawing the meat right off of the bone. So tender and flavorful. And it was HUGE! I mean, look at that pic! Of course, I finished every last bite. (Gotta pad that muffin top.) b. enjoyed her duck confit, which was also cooked very well and came in a large portion too. The sauce made a nice pairing - complemented the meat without overpowering it. But in the end, I think my lamb shank KO'ed b's duck, hands down. Our appetizer, the foie gras, was okay, nothing special. But we also had no idea what "au torchon" meant when we ordered it so maybe our expectations were off. We probably would have done better with the beef tartare, which looked pretty good from the looks of the table next to us, but we were pretty meat-ed out by that point in our trip.Service was friendly enough. When we arrived early for dinner, I asked our waiter whether we could be seated on the second floor in front of the open balcony. In typical French form, he responded with a short but polite, "No, is impossible." This tickled us. Oh, if only I had a French accent.Had high hopes for this place after seeing such good reviews. Overall, an ok restaurant but not up to a 4 or 5 stars we saw. Service was solid, ambiance was adorable and the food was....ok.The setting on cute Prince Arthur pedestrian way is like having a slice of Paris in this section of Montreal.    The chairs and the tables facing the street are very much Parisian.

The ambience is perfect and the staff will make sure that you have a great experience.Good wine list, which is not a difficult thing to do in Montreal.First course--torchon de foie gras, nicely done.Mesclun salads were fresh.Main course--where it counts--we swear that the "monkfish" special was sea bass.  Not bad, but not great.  False advertising, in my opinion.Confit de Canard was old, tired, and had skin the consistency of a limp dishrag, not crispy as it should be.  Server asked how it was, and I complained.  No acknowledgement of the complaint, not even a slight apology.  By the way, I did NOT finish my plate, which is rare.  What is the purpose of asking the customer how dinner is, if nothing is done?We did not bother with dessert after that.  My opinion is that you should not bother with this restaurant.  I imagine that my opinion will not matter, though, because they are in a good location, and attract plenty of business.  We will not be dining here on our next visit to Montreal.This was our second time at Les Deux Gamins - we always try to include one French place on our trip.  Food-wise, the experience was consistent with last time.  This time around, I got the foie gras to start, and lamb shank for main dish - she got the goat cheese salad and steak.  Most notably, they give very large portions here for French cuisine (which is a good thing, some places sacrifice substance for presentation) - I was completely stuffed by lamb at the end of the meal.  The meat was also very tender, especially for lamb which can be tough at some places.  I think they could downsize the meat and upsize the accompaniment a bit, but really just a minor complaint.Service wise everyone was very friendly.  I do have to say, it was a 100% different experience coming here in the summer vs the winter.  In the winter we were probably 1 of 4 couples in the entire place, seated by a cozy fire.  In the summer this time around, the place was jammed pack, and even with a reservation we got seated indoors (there is a large outdoor area).  However, we were still close to the window and most importantly, the service didn't seem to suffer too much from this. Great place overall.Oh my my my - C'est FANTASTIQUE in absolutely every way possible! Started with an appetizer of the escargot (snails) du jour - which they described as "SPANISH style" but really it was sautéed snails with spinach and truffle oil & balsamic vinaigrette, the most amazing appetizer that I've ever had....probably in my life. We also had the Beef Tartare - superb - absolutely a delicious start to our meal.Then for our entrees we ordered the Duck Confit, Flank Steak & the Lamb Shank in Whiskey BBQ sauce. ALL 3 were absolutely amazingly delicious but the Lamb Shank wins the competition! Mind blowing sauce and the tender lamb fell off the bone just by touching it.All around - one of the most amazing meals that we had in Montreal - highly recommend!!!!!Classic Bistro.  Classic items on a small menu.  Food was decent, good portions and quality was fine.  The waiter and his service is poor.  His greeting was friendly but after taking our order he never looked at is again.  Never came to see if everything was ok, if we would want more wine/ water.  Finished our food and took a good 15min to clear dishes, which the bus girl did.  She brought our food, checked if we were ok, cleared our dishes and took our dessert order, all the while the waiter was around us talking and serving the tables next to us but would ignore us.  Poor bus girl was rushing around trying to cover her job and his job along with those huge party happening upstairs.  He would get 1 or 2 stars.  :-(I'm always nervous when friends warn me that the restaurant were going to is relatively un-vegetarian friendly. Sometimes, though, that's where real gems of dishes for us herbivores can be found! Such was the case at Les Deux Gamins, where besides a delicious bottle of rosé, I enjoyed:  Frites/French Fries ($4): Everything I ever craved was in these fries. Julienne cut, salty, crispy on the outside, melt-in-your-mouth fluffy on the inside, and dredged through whatever that dangerously delicious white sauce was (I don't want to know what's in it, do I?)? I probably could have just eaten baskets of these all.night.long. with endless glasses of wine and been entirely satisfied.Salade de chèvre chaud et noix de Grenoble/Warm goat cheese and walnut salad (16.50): This was one of the lone options I had for my entree choices, and it was grand. A heaping mound of greens with a walnut dusting and four sizable slices of toast each covered with a thick slab of goat cheese (and did I taste a hint of honey on it, too?). Yes, please! The goat cheese was beyond plentiful and generous, too, more than I've ever seen at a restaurant before... so if you like cheese... and you're a vegetarian... I promise, you will not go hungry with this option (also, be sure to have more rosé to wash each bite down with as goat cheese itself can be very dry in the most amazing of ways). So despite the lack of choices, would I come back here again? Absolutely. Sitting outside right on Prince Arthur does, as another reviewer mentioned, feel very much like Europe. It helped that a gentleman showed up to play French music for a spell, that the young girls next to us were excitedly talking about their backpacking trip, that the waitstaff was attentive, that my company was lovely, the weather was perfect, and that the rosé was divine after a long day of flying. Couldn't have had a more "just right" dinner my first night in Montreal!Very nice place to have dinner! The food are so yummy and ppl are friendly! Be sure will come back! The waiter Simon did great job! Hope next time still can server by him.We ordered beef tartare, duck confit and braised lamb shank as recommended by the waiter and they were all so delicious! The restaurant was quite busy when we were there, but the waiter did try his best to pay attention to all of us and provide great service. Would totally recommend this place ~~I went here with my group of friends and I can say with confidence that this place delivers in terms of food and service.The interior of this place is very cute and I enjoyed the ambiance a lot. Great music, great staff.I sampled a lot of my friend's plates as well and I thought that each entree was balanced so well in terms of flavour and also had big portions for the price, especially for French bistro food. I have a big appetite and this place left me very full. The salmon tartare was delicately seasoned and the beef tartare was complemented nicely wish fresh greens. It is so rare to see such fresh greens as garnish in Toronto. For dessert, there was creme brulee (it's very big!) and the flambed pineapples. The pineapples tasted heavily of alcohol, which may be a plus for some.Overall, very satisfied with my experience.One more star for the attention taken by the restaurant to address my issue and reply to my comment. I appreciate that level of customer service. I was really looking forward to this place after reading all the great Yelp reviews. What a disappointment! The service was rushed and impersonal, the dishes SO average (my steak was severely overcooked and came with cooked lettuce that was completely flavorless). We had dinner in less than 20 minutes and it felt that the staff was more concerned by turning tables than providing a memorable experience.My Order: Duck Confit (delicious)Pros+ FOOD: very delicious. While I'm not surprised that the serving was so small (it's french food after all), the duck was quite moist and delicious. + PATIO: the doors to the restaurant were large and open which allowed for the enjoyment of the great weather despite being situated in doors. Cons- W/R: only one per sex. The design of the washroom was inconvenient as the water from the sink was so close to the sink that you couldn't wash your hands without touching the sink's surface (which only serves to make your hands dirty as opposed to cleaner).- SERVICE: the waiter gave me the dirtiest look when I decided to skip an app and opt for an entree and a drink instead. Excuse me? For the premium prices that I'm paying, the least I should come to expect is top notch service (-2 points). We also would've wanted split bills but it comes as no surprise that the waiter didn't ask before handing us our bill. tl;dr? good food. shitty service.I really liked this place. We booked the thanksgiving diner pre fix. The meal was great and so was the wine pairing. The only thing that was missing was the cranberry sauce. The chef made a beet and apple sauce which was good but not the same. Everything else was terrific. I especially liked the pumpkin pie which was made in a tart crust and was especially thin.This place was surprisingly good. It is a touristy restaurant and I'm not sure how often it is frequented by the real Montrealers. Having lived here for about a year, however, I would say that it's just as good as the other local gems of the city.The service was spotty. We ordered the warm goat cheese salad, duck confit and sea bass as our main entrees. All super delicious and rich. For dessert we had their bread pudding, which was essentially a deconstructed pain au chocolat. Very delicious.My favorite meal in Montreal. This is the place to go if you're looking for authentic French-style cuisine. Service was wonderful and I got a French lesson, too--which is  hugely important when you're learning the language.One of the best meals we had while we were in Montreal. That lamb shank...oh my. Let me tell ya, I was holding myself back from picking it up and gnawing the meat right off of the bone. So tender and flavorful. And it was HUGE! I mean, look at that pic! Of course, I finished every last bite. (Gotta pad that muffin top.) b. enjoyed her duck confit, which was also cooked very well and came in a large portion too. The sauce made a nice pairing - complemented the meat without overpowering it. But in the end, I think my lamb shank KO'ed b's duck, hands down. Our appetizer, the foie gras, was okay, nothing special. But we also had no idea what "au torchon" meant when we ordered it so maybe our expectations were off. We probably would have done better with the beef tartare, which looked pretty good from the looks of the table next to us, but we were pretty meat-ed out by that point in our trip.Service was friendly enough. When we arrived early for dinner, I asked our waiter whether we could be seated on the second floor in front of the open balcony. In typical French form, he responded with a short but polite, "No, is impossible." This tickled us. Oh, if only I had a French accent.Had high hopes for this place after seeing such good reviews. Overall, an ok restaurant but not up to a 4 or 5 stars we saw. Service was solid, ambiance was adorable and the food was....ok.The setting on cute Prince Arthur pedestrian way is like having a slice of Paris in this section of Montreal.    The chairs and the tables facing the street are very much Parisian. The service is good with waiters speaking basic English.   The complementary bread was crispy on the edges, warm and soft in the center. I had the duck confit and it was delicious....the sauce was tangy and sweet, the meat was moist, tender and just devine.   My BF got the hanger steak and it was good, but a bit chewy.  Also for about $25, that beef was only about 4 oz....very small.   Otherwise a nice cool dining experience in Montreal.Very cute restaurant, and they offer outdoor seating as well! My sister and I had come here for a late dinner (~9:30), so they had already run out of several options for main courses, including the lamb shank (which I had been eyeing), and the duck ravioli (which my sister had been contemplating). My sister ended up getting the beef tartare with a side of fries and salad, and I opted for the sea bass on a bed of quinoa, and we had the torchon de foie gras to start. They also serve complimentary bread !The foie gras was good, but we both haven't had foie gras often enough to tell whether it was amazing. The mains were both really good though! My sister really enjoyed her beef tartare, and my sea bass was delicious as well, and the quinoa was super flavorful. At the end of our meal, we were both stuffed, but decided to share a dessert. We got the pineapples with sugar on top, which was doused in rum. It was really cool, because our server, Simon, brought the rum to our table, and lit it on fire in front of us! Super super cool! Overall, it was a great dining experience - the food was really tasty, the service was really good and friendly, and I really like the outdoor patio! Will definitely come back again (at an earlier time) to try their other menu items!Good food absolutely crappy service.  We didn't get the waiter to come by for half an hour.   We had to wait a half hour for drinks and bread after putting in  the order.   We had to ask,  after almost finishing dinner for two dishes.   Our waiter was so bad that two other waitresses had to step up and replenish bread,  water  and provide desert.   But he was very attentive when it came time to leave ands tip.  On to the food.   The food overall was good to very good,  with the gnocchi in a foie gras sauce outstanding, light fluffy with a satisfying foie gras flavor. I personally found some of the food to be slightly underseasoned, but the rest of my party thought things were ok. Salmon tartar was fresh and flavorful.  Foie gras was rich and well prepared.Easily a four star with a decent server.YES! Just YES! Love this place, must try if you are in Montreal! Amazing food, well done, good proportions. Friendly and knowledgeable service. Wine was great too!Great and affordable French bistro eats...in the heart of Montreal!Rus and I made reservations to dine here, and were greeted with extremely courteous service throughout the entirety of our meal.We ordered the french onion soup, beef tartare, duck confit and braised lamb shank. After ordering, the hostess walked us through the wine list and helped us choose something that would pair well with our meal. Wines by the glass were also very affordable (most of the options were under $10CAD/glass).The food was great! The french onion soup was rich and delicious. A bit on the breadier side, but I still enjoyed it very much. Rus also enjoyed the beef tartare. It came with fried capers, which I had never seen before (but they were delicious)!Our entrees were so good! I love the duck confit and the lamb shank was also very rich.

The goat cheese was beyond plentiful and generous, too, more than I've ever seen at a restaurant before... so if you like cheese... and you're a vegetarian... I promise, you will not go hungry with this option (also, be sure to have more rosé to wash each bite down with as goat cheese itself can be very dry in the most amazing of ways). So despite the lack of choices, would I come back here again? Absolutely. Sitting outside right on Prince Arthur does, as another reviewer mentioned, feel very much like Europe. It helped that a gentleman showed up to play French music for a spell, that the young girls next to us were excitedly talking about their backpacking trip, that the waitstaff was attentive, that my company was lovely, the weather was perfect, and that the rosé was divine after a long day of flying. Couldn't have had a more "just right" dinner my first night in Montreal!Very nice place to have dinner! The food are so yummy and ppl are friendly! Be sure will come back! The waiter Simon did great job! Hope next time still can server by him.We ordered beef tartare, duck confit and braised lamb shank as recommended by the waiter and they were all so delicious! The restaurant was quite busy when we were there, but the waiter did try his best to pay attention to all of us and provide great service. Would totally recommend this place ~~I went here with my group of friends and I can say with confidence that this place delivers in terms of food and service.The interior of this place is very cute and I enjoyed the ambiance a lot. Great music, great staff.I sampled a lot of my friend's plates as well and I thought that each entree was balanced so well in terms of flavour and also had big portions for the price, especially for French bistro food. I have a big appetite and this place left me very full. The salmon tartare was delicately seasoned and the beef tartare was complemented nicely wish fresh greens. It is so rare to see such fresh greens as garnish in Toronto. For dessert, there was creme brulee (it's very big!) and the flambed pineapples. The pineapples tasted heavily of alcohol, which may be a plus for some.Overall, very satisfied with my experience.One more star for the attention taken by the restaurant to address my issue and reply to my comment. I appreciate that level of customer service. I was really looking forward to this place after reading all the great Yelp reviews. What a disappointment! The service was rushed and impersonal, the dishes SO average (my steak was severely overcooked and came with cooked lettuce that was completely flavorless). We had dinner in less than 20 minutes and it felt that the staff was more concerned by turning tables than providing a memorable experience.My Order: Duck Confit (delicious)Pros+ FOOD: very delicious. While I'm not surprised that the serving was so small (it's french food after all), the duck was quite moist and delicious. + PATIO: the doors to the restaurant were large and open which allowed for the enjoyment of the great weather despite being situated in doors. Cons- W/R: only one per sex. The design of the washroom was inconvenient as the water from the sink was so close to the sink that you couldn't wash your hands without touching the sink's surface (which only serves to make your hands dirty as opposed to cleaner).- SERVICE: the waiter gave me the dirtiest look when I decided to skip an app and opt for an entree and a drink instead. Excuse me? For the premium prices that I'm paying, the least I should come to expect is top notch service (-2 points). We also would've wanted split bills but it comes as no surprise that the waiter didn't ask before handing us our bill. tl;dr? good food. shitty service.I really liked this place. We booked the thanksgiving diner pre fix. The meal was great and so was the wine pairing. The only thing that was missing was the cranberry sauce. The chef made a beet and apple sauce which was good but not the same. Everything else was terrific. I especially liked the pumpkin pie which was made in a tart crust and was especially thin.This place was surprisingly good. It is a touristy restaurant and I'm not sure how often it is frequented by the real Montrealers. Having lived here for about a year, however, I would say that it's just as good as the other local gems of the city.The service was spotty. We ordered the warm goat cheese salad, duck confit and sea bass as our main entrees. All super delicious and rich. For dessert we had their bread pudding, which was essentially a deconstructed pain au chocolat. Very delicious.My favorite meal in Montreal. This is the place to go if you're looking for authentic French-style cuisine. Service was wonderful and I got a French lesson, too--which is  hugely important when you're learning the language.One of the best meals we had while we were in Montreal. That lamb shank...oh my. Let me tell ya, I was holding myself back from picking it up and gnawing the meat right off of the bone. So tender and flavorful. And it was HUGE! I mean, look at that pic! Of course, I finished every last bite. (Gotta pad that muffin top.) b. enjoyed her duck confit, which was also cooked very well and came in a large portion too. The sauce made a nice pairing - complemented the meat without overpowering it. But in the end, I think my lamb shank KO'ed b's duck, hands down. Our appetizer, the foie gras, was okay, nothing special. But we also had no idea what "au torchon" meant when we ordered it so maybe our expectations were off. We probably would have done better with the beef tartare, which looked pretty good from the looks of the table next to us, but we were pretty meat-ed out by that point in our trip.Service was friendly enough. When we arrived early for dinner, I asked our waiter whether we could be seated on the second floor in front of the open balcony. In typical French form, he responded with a short but polite, "No, is impossible." This tickled us. Oh, if only I had a French accent.Had high hopes for this place after seeing such good reviews. Overall, an ok restaurant but not up to a 4 or 5 stars we saw. Service was solid, ambiance was adorable and the food was....ok.The setting on cute Prince Arthur pedestrian way is like having a slice of Paris in this section of Montreal.    The chairs and the tables facing the street are very much Parisian. The service is good with waiters speaking basic English.   The complementary bread was crispy on the edges, warm and soft in the center. I had the duck confit and it was delicious....the sauce was tangy and sweet, the meat was moist, tender and just devine.   My BF got the hanger steak and it was good, but a bit chewy.  Also for about $25, that beef was only about 4 oz....very small.   Otherwise a nice cool dining experience in Montreal.Very cute restaurant, and they offer outdoor seating as well! My sister and I had come here for a late dinner (~9:30), so they had already run out of several options for main courses, including the lamb shank (which I had been eyeing), and the duck ravioli (which my sister had been contemplating). My sister ended up getting the beef tartare with a side of fries and salad, and I opted for the sea bass on a bed of quinoa, and we had the torchon de foie gras to start. They also serve complimentary bread !The foie gras was good, but we both haven't had foie gras often enough to tell whether it was amazing. The mains were both really good though! My sister really enjoyed her beef tartare, and my sea bass was delicious as well, and the quinoa was super flavorful. At the end of our meal, we were both stuffed, but decided to share a dessert. We got the pineapples with sugar on top, which was doused in rum. It was really cool, because our server, Simon, brought the rum to our table, and lit it on fire in front of us! Super super cool! Overall, it was a great dining experience - the food was really tasty, the service was really good and friendly, and I really like the outdoor patio! Will definitely come back again (at an earlier time) to try their other menu items!Good food absolutely crappy service.  We didn't get the waiter to come by for half an hour.   We had to wait a half hour for drinks and bread after putting in  the order.   We had to ask,  after almost finishing dinner for two dishes.   Our waiter was so bad that two other waitresses had to step up and replenish bread,  water  and provide desert.   But he was very attentive when it came time to leave ands tip.  On to the food.   The food overall was good to very good,  with the gnocchi in a foie gras sauce outstanding, light fluffy with a satisfying foie gras flavor. I personally found some of the food to be slightly underseasoned, but the rest of my party thought things were ok. Salmon tartar was fresh and flavorful.  Foie gras was rich and well prepared.Easily a four star with a decent server.YES! Just YES! Love this place, must try if you are in Montreal! Amazing food, well done, good proportions. Friendly and knowledgeable service. Wine was great too!Great and affordable French bistro eats...in the heart of Montreal!Rus and I made reservations to dine here, and were greeted with extremely courteous service throughout the entirety of our meal.We ordered the french onion soup, beef tartare, duck confit and braised lamb shank. After ordering, the hostess walked us through the wine list and helped us choose something that would pair well with our meal. Wines by the glass were also very affordable (most of the options were under $10CAD/glass).The food was great! The french onion soup was rich and delicious. A bit on the breadier side, but I still enjoyed it very much. Rus also enjoyed the beef tartare. It came with fried capers, which I had never seen before (but they were delicious)!Our entrees were so good! I love the duck confit and the lamb shank was also very rich. The portions were pretty large, but so good that we just couldn't stop eating.We ended our meal with the creme brulee dessert (free with Yelp check-in), it was eh...but I won't complain about a free dessert (maybe spring for the bread pudding though)!Les Deux Gamins is perfect for a date-night outing. The ambience is perfect and the staff will make sure that you have a great experience.Good wine list, which is not a difficult thing to do in Montreal.First course--torchon de foie gras, nicely done.Mesclun salads were fresh.Main course--where it counts--we swear that the "monkfish" special was sea bass.  Not bad, but not great.  False advertising, in my opinion.Confit de Canard was old, tired, and had skin the consistency of a limp dishrag, not crispy as it should be.  Server asked how it was, and I complained.  No acknowledgement of the complaint, not even a slight apology.  By the way, I did NOT finish my plate, which is rare.  What is the purpose of asking the customer how dinner is, if nothing is done?We did not bother with dessert after that.  My opinion is that you should not bother with this restaurant.  I imagine that my opinion will not matter, though, because they are in a good location, and attract plenty of business.  We will not be dining here on our next visit to Montreal.This was our second time at Les Deux Gamins - we always try to include one French place on our trip.  Food-wise, the experience was consistent with last time.  This time around, I got the foie gras to start, and lamb shank for main dish - she got the goat cheese salad and steak.  Most notably, they give very large portions here for French cuisine (which is a good thing, some places sacrifice substance for presentation) - I was completely stuffed by lamb at the end of the meal.  The meat was also very tender, especially for lamb which can be tough at some places.  I think they could downsize the meat and upsize the accompaniment a bit, but really just a minor complaint.Service wise everyone was very friendly.  I do have to say, it was a 100% different experience coming here in the summer vs the winter.  In the winter we were probably 1 of 4 couples in the entire place, seated by a cozy fire.  In the summer this time around, the place was jammed pack, and even with a reservation we got seated indoors (there is a large outdoor area).  However, we were still close to the window and most importantly, the service didn't seem to suffer too much from this. Great place overall.Oh my my my - C'est FANTASTIQUE in absolutely every way possible! Started with an appetizer of the escargot (snails) du jour - which they described as "SPANISH style" but really it was sautéed snails with spinach and truffle oil & balsamic vinaigrette, the most amazing appetizer that I've ever had....probably in my life. We also had the Beef Tartare - superb - absolutely a delicious start to our meal.Then for our entrees we ordered the Duck Confit, Flank Steak & the Lamb Shank in Whiskey BBQ sauce. ALL 3 were absolutely amazingly delicious but the Lamb Shank wins the competition! Mind blowing sauce and the tender lamb fell off the bone just by touching it.All around - one of the most amazing meals that we had in Montreal - highly recommend!!!!!Classic Bistro.  Classic items on a small menu.  Food was decent, good portions and quality was fine.  The waiter and his service is poor.  His greeting was friendly but after taking our order he never looked at is again.  Never came to see if everything was ok, if we would want more wine/ water.  Finished our food and took a good 15min to clear dishes, which the bus girl did.  She brought our food, checked if we were ok, cleared our dishes and took our dessert order, all the while the waiter was around us talking and serving the tables next to us but would ignore us.  Poor bus girl was rushing around trying to cover her job and his job along with those huge party happening upstairs.  He would get 1 or 2 stars.  :-(I'm always nervous when friends warn me that the restaurant were going to is relatively un-vegetarian friendly. Sometimes, though, that's where real gems of dishes for us herbivores can be found! Such was the case at Les Deux Gamins, where besides a delicious bottle of rosé, I enjoyed:  Frites/French Fries ($4): Everything I ever craved was in these fries. Julienne cut, salty, crispy on the outside, melt-in-your-mouth fluffy on the inside, and dredged through whatever that dangerously delicious white sauce was (I don't want to know what's in it, do I?)? I probably could have just eaten baskets of these all.night.long. with endless glasses of wine and been entirely satisfied.Salade de chèvre chaud et noix de Grenoble/Warm goat cheese and walnut salad (16.50): This was one of the lone options I had for my entree choices, and it was grand.

Let me tell ya, I was holding myself back from picking it up and gnawing the meat right off of the bone. So tender and flavorful. And it was HUGE! I mean, look at that pic! Of course, I finished every last bite. (Gotta pad that muffin top.) b. enjoyed her duck confit, which was also cooked very well and came in a large portion too. The sauce made a nice pairing - complemented the meat without overpowering it. But in the end, I think my lamb shank KO'ed b's duck, hands down. Our appetizer, the foie gras, was okay, nothing special. But we also had no idea what "au torchon" meant when we ordered it so maybe our expectations were off. We probably would have done better with the beef tartare, which looked pretty good from the looks of the table next to us, but we were pretty meat-ed out by that point in our trip.Service was friendly enough. When we arrived early for dinner, I asked our waiter whether we could be seated on the second floor in front of the open balcony. In typical French form, he responded with a short but polite, "No, is impossible." This tickled us. Oh, if only I had a French accent.Had high hopes for this place after seeing such good reviews. Overall, an ok restaurant but not up to a 4 or 5 stars we saw. Service was solid, ambiance was adorable and the food was....ok.The setting on cute Prince Arthur pedestrian way is like having a slice of Paris in this section of Montreal.    The chairs and the tables facing the street are very much Parisian. The service is good with waiters speaking basic English.   The complementary bread was crispy on the edges, warm and soft in the center. I had the duck confit and it was delicious....the sauce was tangy and sweet, the meat was moist, tender and just devine.   My BF got the hanger steak and it was good, but a bit chewy.  Also for about $25, that beef was only about 4 oz....very small.   Otherwise a nice cool dining experience in Montreal.Very cute restaurant, and they offer outdoor seating as well! My sister and I had come here for a late dinner (~9:30), so they had already run out of several options for main courses, including the lamb shank (which I had been eyeing), and the duck ravioli (which my sister had been contemplating). My sister ended up getting the beef tartare with a side of fries and salad, and I opted for the sea bass on a bed of quinoa, and we had the torchon de foie gras to start. They also serve complimentary bread !The foie gras was good, but we both haven't had foie gras often enough to tell whether it was amazing. The mains were both really good though! My sister really enjoyed her beef tartare, and my sea bass was delicious as well, and the quinoa was super flavorful. At the end of our meal, we were both stuffed, but decided to share a dessert. We got the pineapples with sugar on top, which was doused in rum. It was really cool, because our server, Simon, brought the rum to our table, and lit it on fire in front of us! Super super cool! Overall, it was a great dining experience - the food was really tasty, the service was really good and friendly, and I really like the outdoor patio! Will definitely come back again (at an earlier time) to try their other menu items!Good food absolutely crappy service.  We didn't get the waiter to come by for half an hour.   We had to wait a half hour for drinks and bread after putting in  the order.   We had to ask,  after almost finishing dinner for two dishes.   Our waiter was so bad that two other waitresses had to step up and replenish bread,  water  and provide desert.   But he was very attentive when it came time to leave ands tip.  On to the food.   The food overall was good to very good,  with the gnocchi in a foie gras sauce outstanding, light fluffy with a satisfying foie gras flavor. I personally found some of the food to be slightly underseasoned, but the rest of my party thought things were ok. Salmon tartar was fresh and flavorful.  Foie gras was rich and well prepared.Easily a four star with a decent server.YES! Just YES! Love this place, must try if you are in Montreal! Amazing food, well done, good proportions. Friendly and knowledgeable service. Wine was great too!Great and affordable French bistro eats...in the heart of Montreal!Rus and I made reservations to dine here, and were greeted with extremely courteous service throughout the entirety of our meal.We ordered the french onion soup, beef tartare, duck confit and braised lamb shank. After ordering, the hostess walked us through the wine list and helped us choose something that would pair well with our meal. Wines by the glass were also very affordable (most of the options were under $10CAD/glass).The food was great! The french onion soup was rich and delicious. A bit on the breadier side, but I still enjoyed it very much. Rus also enjoyed the beef tartare. It came with fried capers, which I had never seen before (but they were delicious)!Our entrees were so good! I love the duck confit and the lamb shank was also very rich. The portions were pretty large, but so good that we just couldn't stop eating.We ended our meal with the creme brulee dessert (free with Yelp check-in), it was eh...but I won't complain about a free dessert (maybe spring for the bread pudding though)!Les Deux Gamins is perfect for a date-night outing. The ambience is perfect and the staff will make sure that you have a great experience.Good wine list, which is not a difficult thing to do in Montreal.First course--torchon de foie gras, nicely done.Mesclun salads were fresh.Main course--where it counts--we swear that the "monkfish" special was sea bass.  Not bad, but not great.  False advertising, in my opinion.Confit de Canard was old, tired, and had skin the consistency of a limp dishrag, not crispy as it should be.  Server asked how it was, and I complained.  No acknowledgement of the complaint, not even a slight apology.  By the way, I did NOT finish my plate, which is rare.  What is the purpose of asking the customer how dinner is, if nothing is done?We did not bother with dessert after that.  My opinion is that you should not bother with this restaurant.  I imagine that my opinion will not matter, though, because they are in a good location, and attract plenty of business.  We will not be dining here on our next visit to Montreal.This was our second time at Les Deux Gamins - we always try to include one French place on our trip.  Food-wise, the experience was consistent with last time.  This time around, I got the foie gras to start, and lamb shank for main dish - she got the goat cheese salad and steak.  Most notably, they give very large portions here for French cuisine (which is a good thing, some places sacrifice substance for presentation) - I was completely stuffed by lamb at the end of the meal.  The meat was also very tender, especially for lamb which can be tough at some places.  I think they could downsize the meat and upsize the accompaniment a bit, but really just a minor complaint.Service wise everyone was very friendly.  I do have to say, it was a 100% different experience coming here in the summer vs the winter.  In the winter we were probably 1 of 4 couples in the entire place, seated by a cozy fire.  In the summer this time around, the place was jammed pack, and even with a reservation we got seated indoors (there is a large outdoor area).  However, we were still close to the window and most importantly, the service didn't seem to suffer too much from this. Great place overall.Oh my my my - C'est FANTASTIQUE in absolutely every way possible! Started with an appetizer of the escargot (snails) du jour - which they described as "SPANISH style" but really it was sautéed snails with spinach and truffle oil & balsamic vinaigrette, the most amazing appetizer that I've ever had....probably in my life. We also had the Beef Tartare - superb - absolutely a delicious start to our meal.Then for our entrees we ordered the Duck Confit, Flank Steak & the Lamb Shank in Whiskey BBQ sauce. ALL 3 were absolutely amazingly delicious but the Lamb Shank wins the competition! Mind blowing sauce and the tender lamb fell off the bone just by touching it.All around - one of the most amazing meals that we had in Montreal - highly recommend!!!!!Classic Bistro.  Classic items on a small menu.  Food was decent, good portions and quality was fine.  The waiter and his service is poor.  His greeting was friendly but after taking our order he never looked at is again.  Never came to see if everything was ok, if we would want more wine/ water.  Finished our food and took a good 15min to clear dishes, which the bus girl did.  She brought our food, checked if we were ok, cleared our dishes and took our dessert order, all the while the waiter was around us talking and serving the tables next to us but would ignore us.  Poor bus girl was rushing around trying to cover her job and his job along with those huge party happening upstairs.  He would get 1 or 2 stars.  :-(I'm always nervous when friends warn me that the restaurant were going to is relatively un-vegetarian friendly. Sometimes, though, that's where real gems of dishes for us herbivores can be found! Such was the case at Les Deux Gamins, where besides a delicious bottle of rosé, I enjoyed:  Frites/French Fries ($4): Everything I ever craved was in these fries. Julienne cut, salty, crispy on the outside, melt-in-your-mouth fluffy on the inside, and dredged through whatever that dangerously delicious white sauce was (I don't want to know what's in it, do I?)? I probably could have just eaten baskets of these all.night.long. with endless glasses of wine and been entirely satisfied.Salade de chèvre chaud et noix de Grenoble/Warm goat cheese and walnut salad (16.50): This was one of the lone options I had for my entree choices, and it was grand. A heaping mound of greens with a walnut dusting and four sizable slices of toast each covered with a thick slab of goat cheese (and did I taste a hint of honey on it, too?). Yes, please! The goat cheese was beyond plentiful and generous, too, more than I've ever seen at a restaurant before... so if you like cheese... and you're a vegetarian... I promise, you will not go hungry with this option (also, be sure to have more rosé to wash each bite down with as goat cheese itself can be very dry in the most amazing of ways). So despite the lack of choices, would I come back here again? Absolutely. Sitting outside right on Prince Arthur does, as another reviewer mentioned, feel very much like Europe. It helped that a gentleman showed up to play French music for a spell, that the young girls next to us were excitedly talking about their backpacking trip, that the waitstaff was attentive, that my company was lovely, the weather was perfect, and that the rosé was divine after a long day of flying. Couldn't have had a more "just right" dinner my first night in Montreal!Very nice place to have dinner! The food are so yummy and ppl are friendly! Be sure will come back! The waiter Simon did great job! Hope next time still can server by him.We ordered beef tartare, duck confit and braised lamb shank as recommended by the waiter and they were all so delicious! The restaurant was quite busy when we were there, but the waiter did try his best to pay attention to all of us and provide great service. Would totally recommend this place ~~I went here with my group of friends and I can say with confidence that this place delivers in terms of food and service.The interior of this place is very cute and I enjoyed the ambiance a lot. Great music, great staff.I sampled a lot of my friend's plates as well and I thought that each entree was balanced so well in terms of flavour and also had big portions for the price, especially for French bistro food. I have a big appetite and this place left me very full. The salmon tartare was delicately seasoned and the beef tartare was complemented nicely wish fresh greens. It is so rare to see such fresh greens as garnish in Toronto. For dessert, there was creme brulee (it's very big!) and the flambed pineapples. The pineapples tasted heavily of alcohol, which may be a plus for some.Overall, very satisfied with my experience.One more star for the attention taken by the restaurant to address my issue and reply to my comment. I appreciate that level of customer service. I was really looking forward to this place after reading all the great Yelp reviews. What a disappointment! The service was rushed and impersonal, the dishes SO average (my steak was severely overcooked and came with cooked lettuce that was completely flavorless). We had dinner in less than 20 minutes and it felt that the staff was more concerned by turning tables than providing a memorable experience.My Order: Duck Confit (delicious)Pros+ FOOD: very delicious. While I'm not surprised that the serving was so small (it's french food after all), the duck was quite moist and delicious. + PATIO: the doors to the restaurant were large and open which allowed for the enjoyment of the great weather despite being situated in doors. Cons- W/R: only one per sex. The design of the washroom was inconvenient as the water from the sink was so close to the sink that you couldn't wash your hands without touching the sink's surface (which only serves to make your hands dirty as opposed to cleaner).- SERVICE: the waiter gave me the dirtiest look when I decided to skip an app and opt for an entree and a drink instead. Excuse me? For the premium prices that I'm paying, the least I should come to expect is top notch service (-2 points). We also would've wanted split bills but it comes as no surprise that the waiter didn't ask before handing us our bill. tl;dr? good food. shitty service.I really liked this place. We booked the thanksgiving diner pre fix. The meal was great and so was the wine pairing. The only thing that was missing was the cranberry sauce. The chef made a beet and apple sauce which was good but not the same. Everything else was terrific. I especially liked the pumpkin pie which was made in a tart crust and was especially thin.This place was surprisingly good. It is a touristy restaurant and I'm not sure how often it is frequented by the real Montrealers. Having lived here for about a year, however, I would say that it's just as good as the other local gems of the city.The service was spotty. We ordered the warm goat cheese salad, duck confit and sea bass as our main entrees. All super delicious and rich. For dessert we had their bread pudding, which was essentially a deconstructed pain au chocolat. Very delicious.My favorite meal in Montreal. This is the place to go if you're looking for authentic French-style cuisine. Service was wonderful and I got a French lesson, too--which is  hugely important when you're learning the language.One of the best meals we had while we were in Montreal. That lamb shank...oh my.

It came with fried capers, which I had never seen before (but they were delicious)!Our entrees were so good! I love the duck confit and the lamb shank was also very rich. The portions were pretty large, but so good that we just couldn't stop eating.We ended our meal with the creme brulee dessert (free with Yelp check-in), it was eh...but I won't complain about a free dessert (maybe spring for the bread pudding though)!Les Deux Gamins is perfect for a date-night outing. The ambience is perfect and the staff will make sure that you have a great experience.Good wine list, which is not a difficult thing to do in Montreal.First course--torchon de foie gras, nicely done.Mesclun salads were fresh.Main course--where it counts--we swear that the "monkfish" special was sea bass.  Not bad, but not great.  False advertising, in my opinion.Confit de Canard was old, tired, and had skin the consistency of a limp dishrag, not crispy as it should be.  Server asked how it was, and I complained.  No acknowledgement of the complaint, not even a slight apology.  By the way, I did NOT finish my plate, which is rare.  What is the purpose of asking the customer how dinner is, if nothing is done?We did not bother with dessert after that.  My opinion is that you should not bother with this restaurant.  I imagine that my opinion will not matter, though, because they are in a good location, and attract plenty of business.  We will not be dining here on our next visit to Montreal.This was our second time at Les Deux Gamins - we always try to include one French place on our trip.  Food-wise, the experience was consistent with last time.  This time around, I got the foie gras to start, and lamb shank for main dish - she got the goat cheese salad and steak.  Most notably, they give very large portions here for French cuisine (which is a good thing, some places sacrifice substance for presentation) - I was completely stuffed by lamb at the end of the meal.  The meat was also very tender, especially for lamb which can be tough at some places.  I think they could downsize the meat and upsize the accompaniment a bit, but really just a minor complaint.Service wise everyone was very friendly.  I do have to say, it was a 100% different experience coming here in the summer vs the winter.  In the winter we were probably 1 of 4 couples in the entire place, seated by a cozy fire.  In the summer this time around, the place was jammed pack, and even with a reservation we got seated indoors (there is a large outdoor area).  However, we were still close to the window and most importantly, the service didn't seem to suffer too much from this. Great place overall.Oh my my my - C'est FANTASTIQUE in absolutely every way possible! Started with an appetizer of the escargot (snails) du jour - which they described as "SPANISH style" but really it was sautéed snails with spinach and truffle oil & balsamic vinaigrette, the most amazing appetizer that I've ever had....probably in my life. We also had the Beef Tartare - superb - absolutely a delicious start to our meal.Then for our entrees we ordered the Duck Confit, Flank Steak & the Lamb Shank in Whiskey BBQ sauce. ALL 3 were absolutely amazingly delicious but the Lamb Shank wins the competition! Mind blowing sauce and the tender lamb fell off the bone just by touching it.All around - one of the most amazing meals that we had in Montreal - highly recommend!!!!!Classic Bistro.  Classic items on a small menu.  Food was decent, good portions and quality was fine.  The waiter and his service is poor.  His greeting was friendly but after taking our order he never looked at is again.  Never came to see if everything was ok, if we would want more wine/ water.  Finished our food and took a good 15min to clear dishes, which the bus girl did.  She brought our food, checked if we were ok, cleared our dishes and took our dessert order, all the while the waiter was around us talking and serving the tables next to us but would ignore us.  Poor bus girl was rushing around trying to cover her job and his job along with those huge party happening upstairs.  He would get 1 or 2 stars.  :-(I'm always nervous when friends warn me that the restaurant were going to is relatively un-vegetarian friendly. Sometimes, though, that's where real gems of dishes for us herbivores can be found! Such was the case at Les Deux Gamins, where besides a delicious bottle of rosé, I enjoyed:  Frites/French Fries ($4): Everything I ever craved was in these fries. Julienne cut, salty, crispy on the outside, melt-in-your-mouth fluffy on the inside, and dredged through whatever that dangerously delicious white sauce was (I don't want to know what's in it, do I?)? I probably could have just eaten baskets of these all.night.long. with endless glasses of wine and been entirely satisfied.Salade de chèvre chaud et noix de Grenoble/Warm goat cheese and walnut salad (16.50): This was one of the lone options I had for my entree choices, and it was grand. A heaping mound of greens with a walnut dusting and four sizable slices of toast each covered with a thick slab of goat cheese (and did I taste a hint of honey on it, too?). Yes, please! The goat cheese was beyond plentiful and generous, too, more than I've ever seen at a restaurant before... so if you like cheese... and you're a vegetarian... I promise, you will not go hungry with this option (also, be sure to have more rosé to wash each bite down with as goat cheese itself can be very dry in the most amazing of ways). So despite the lack of choices, would I come back here again? Absolutely. Sitting outside right on Prince Arthur does, as another reviewer mentioned, feel very much like Europe. It helped that a gentleman showed up to play French music for a spell, that the young girls next to us were excitedly talking about their backpacking trip, that the waitstaff was attentive, that my company was lovely, the weather was perfect, and that the rosé was divine after a long day of flying. Couldn't have had a more "just right" dinner my first night in Montreal!Very nice place to have dinner! The food are so yummy and ppl are friendly! Be sure will come back! The waiter Simon did great job! Hope next time still can server by him.We ordered beef tartare, duck confit and braised lamb shank as recommended by the waiter and they were all so delicious! The restaurant was quite busy when we were there, but the waiter did try his best to pay attention to all of us and provide great service. Would totally recommend this place ~~I went here with my group of friends and I can say with confidence that this place delivers in terms of food and service.The interior of this place is very cute and I enjoyed the ambiance a lot. Great music, great staff.I sampled a lot of my friend's plates as well and I thought that each entree was balanced so well in terms of flavour and also had big portions for the price, especially for French bistro food. I have a big appetite and this place left me very full. The salmon tartare was delicately seasoned and the beef tartare was complemented nicely wish fresh greens. It is so rare to see such fresh greens as garnish in Toronto. For dessert, there was creme brulee (it's very big!) and the flambed pineapples. The pineapples tasted heavily of alcohol, which may be a plus for some.Overall, very satisfied with my experience.One more star for the attention taken by the restaurant to address my issue and reply to my comment. I appreciate that level of customer service. I was really looking forward to this place after reading all the great Yelp reviews. What a disappointment! The service was rushed and impersonal, the dishes SO average (my steak was severely overcooked and came with cooked lettuce that was completely flavorless). We had dinner in less than 20 minutes and it felt that the staff was more concerned by turning tables than providing a memorable experience.My Order: Duck Confit (delicious)Pros+ FOOD: very delicious. While I'm not surprised that the serving was so small (it's french food after all), the duck was quite moist and delicious. + PATIO: the doors to the restaurant were large and open which allowed for the enjoyment of the great weather despite being situated in doors. Cons- W/R: only one per sex. The design of the washroom was inconvenient as the water from the sink was so close to the sink that you couldn't wash your hands without touching the sink's surface (which only serves to make your hands dirty as opposed to cleaner).- SERVICE: the waiter gave me the dirtiest look when I decided to skip an app and opt for an entree and a drink instead. Excuse me? For the premium prices that I'm paying, the least I should come to expect is top notch service (-2 points). We also would've wanted split bills but it comes as no surprise that the waiter didn't ask before handing us our bill. tl;dr? good food. shitty service.I really liked this place. We booked the thanksgiving diner pre fix. The meal was great and so was the wine pairing. The only thing that was missing was the cranberry sauce. The chef made a beet and apple sauce which was good but not the same. Everything else was terrific. I especially liked the pumpkin pie which was made in a tart crust and was especially thin.This place was surprisingly good. It is a touristy restaurant and I'm not sure how often it is frequented by the real Montrealers. Having lived here for about a year, however, I would say that it's just as good as the other local gems of the city.The service was spotty. We ordered the warm goat cheese salad, duck confit and sea bass as our main entrees. All super delicious and rich. For dessert we had their bread pudding, which was essentially a deconstructed pain au chocolat. Very delicious.My favorite meal in Montreal. This is the place to go if you're looking for authentic French-style cuisine. Service was wonderful and I got a French lesson, too--which is  hugely important when you're learning the language.One of the best meals we had while we were in Montreal. That lamb shank...oh my. Let me tell ya, I was holding myself back from picking it up and gnawing the meat right off of the bone. So tender and flavorful. And it was HUGE! I mean, look at that pic! Of course, I finished every last bite. (Gotta pad that muffin top.) b. enjoyed her duck confit, which was also cooked very well and came in a large portion too. The sauce made a nice pairing - complemented the meat without overpowering it. But in the end, I think my lamb shank KO'ed b's duck, hands down. Our appetizer, the foie gras, was okay, nothing special. But we also had no idea what "au torchon" meant when we ordered it so maybe our expectations were off. We probably would have done better with the beef tartare, which looked pretty good from the looks of the table next to us, but we were pretty meat-ed out by that point in our trip.Service was friendly enough. When we arrived early for dinner, I asked our waiter whether we could be seated on the second floor in front of the open balcony. In typical French form, he responded with a short but polite, "No, is impossible." This tickled us. Oh, if only I had a French accent.Had high hopes for this place after seeing such good reviews. Overall, an ok restaurant but not up to a 4 or 5 stars we saw. Service was solid, ambiance was adorable and the food was....ok.The setting on cute Prince Arthur pedestrian way is like having a slice of Paris in this section of Montreal.    The chairs and the tables facing the street are very much Parisian. The service is good with waiters speaking basic English.   The complementary bread was crispy on the edges, warm and soft in the center. I had the duck confit and it was delicious....the sauce was tangy and sweet, the meat was moist, tender and just devine.   My BF got the hanger steak and it was good, but a bit chewy.  Also for about $25, that beef was only about 4 oz....very small.   Otherwise a nice cool dining experience in Montreal.Very cute restaurant, and they offer outdoor seating as well! My sister and I had come here for a late dinner (~9:30), so they had already run out of several options for main courses, including the lamb shank (which I had been eyeing), and the duck ravioli (which my sister had been contemplating). My sister ended up getting the beef tartare with a side of fries and salad, and I opted for the sea bass on a bed of quinoa, and we had the torchon de foie gras to start. They also serve complimentary bread !The foie gras was good, but we both haven't had foie gras often enough to tell whether it was amazing. The mains were both really good though! My sister really enjoyed her beef tartare, and my sea bass was delicious as well, and the quinoa was super flavorful. At the end of our meal, we were both stuffed, but decided to share a dessert. We got the pineapples with sugar on top, which was doused in rum. It was really cool, because our server, Simon, brought the rum to our table, and lit it on fire in front of us! Super super cool! Overall, it was a great dining experience - the food was really tasty, the service was really good and friendly, and I really like the outdoor patio! Will definitely come back again (at an earlier time) to try their other menu items!Good food absolutely crappy service.  We didn't get the waiter to come by for half an hour.   We had to wait a half hour for drinks and bread after putting in  the order.   We had to ask,  after almost finishing dinner for two dishes.   Our waiter was so bad that two other waitresses had to step up and replenish bread,  water  and provide desert.   But he was very attentive when it came time to leave ands tip.  On to the food.   The food overall was good to very good,  with the gnocchi in a foie gras sauce outstanding, light fluffy with a satisfying foie gras flavor. I personally found some of the food to be slightly underseasoned, but the rest of my party thought things were ok. Salmon tartar was fresh and flavorful.  Foie gras was rich and well prepared.Easily a four star with a decent server.YES! Just YES! Love this place, must try if you are in Montreal! Amazing food, well done, good proportions. Friendly and knowledgeable service. Wine was great too!Great and affordable French bistro eats...in the heart of Montreal!Rus and I made reservations to dine here, and were greeted with extremely courteous service throughout the entirety of our meal.We ordered the french onion soup, beef tartare, duck confit and braised lamb shank.

I probably could have just eaten baskets of these all.night.long. with endless glasses of wine and been entirely satisfied.Salade de chèvre chaud et noix de Grenoble/Warm goat cheese and walnut salad (16.50): This was one of the lone options I had for my entree choices, and it was grand. A heaping mound of greens with a walnut dusting and four sizable slices of toast each covered with a thick slab of goat cheese (and did I taste a hint of honey on it, too?). Yes, please! The goat cheese was beyond plentiful and generous, too, more than I've ever seen at a restaurant before... so if you like cheese... and you're a vegetarian... I promise, you will not go hungry with this option (also, be sure to have more rosé to wash each bite down with as goat cheese itself can be very dry in the most amazing of ways). So despite the lack of choices, would I come back here again? Absolutely. Sitting outside right on Prince Arthur does, as another reviewer mentioned, feel very much like Europe. It helped that a gentleman showed up to play French music for a spell, that the young girls next to us were excitedly talking about their backpacking trip, that the waitstaff was attentive, that my company was lovely, the weather was perfect, and that the rosé was divine after a long day of flying. Couldn't have had a more "just right" dinner my first night in Montreal!Very nice place to have dinner! The food are so yummy and ppl are friendly! Be sure will come back! The waiter Simon did great job! Hope next time still can server by him.We ordered beef tartare, duck confit and braised lamb shank as recommended by the waiter and they were all so delicious! The restaurant was quite busy when we were there, but the waiter did try his best to pay attention to all of us and provide great service. Would totally recommend this place ~~
