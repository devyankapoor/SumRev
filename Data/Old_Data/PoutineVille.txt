I'm a huge fan of poutineville simply because I can make my poutine the way I want it! I'm addicted to their "home potatoes" as well! The sauce is always excellent and they get the whole "melt the cheese" thing. I like my poutines "gratinee" as well. Sorry for being a terrible human being...The price-tag is a bit more than a fast food joint but that is to be expected to get "gourmet poutine". Every time I came here service has been amazing and so quick. MY CREATIONS are fun to enjoy even when they don't turn out great, I can't blame them, I'm the crazy patron who always want to try something new with them. Something I never do elsewhere.Awesome place, totally recommend. Good luck on the parking though!WOW NO WORDS!!! This place was great!!!! People that worked here were super helpful and friendly. We started off with a kids meal- grilled cheese and fries ($3.75- ONLY) and they were very generous with portion. My kid loves it. We also had their beers- SOOOOO FRESH and crisp. Awesomeness. Then we ordered POUTINE of course. I got regular fries with cheese curds and gravy topped with guac. It was very good. Next time id skip the guac. Hubby got chopped fries with cheese curds and gravy topped with hot dog. He said very good. I don't eat pork. This was a great meal haha. Fries. Yum. Photo below!!! That's my mouth ha!I enjoyed the first time i came here. I enjoyed the second time i came here, but unfortunately should've stuck with the poutine i ordered the first time.The one i ordered had something like Cheese Whiz on it instead of the real cheese curds, and I've never experienced constipation in my life until after i ate this stuff. I was backed up for 2 days before this stuff cleared my system.Stay away from the Cheese Whiz poutine (that's not what it's called, but you'll know it when you see it listed on the menu)Really great place. The waiters were on point and the food as awesome. You can make your poutine!!!Alright people... For those of you unfamiliar with poutine this place is a spectacular arena to get educated on the subject. French Canadians have taken fries to the next level... They dump a ridiculous amount of unrelated food on top of a heaping pile of fries. And voila! Poutine!!!The classic is what peeps in the north east USA would refer to as Disco Fries... Cheese Curds and gravy on fries.On this visit I had "The Montrealer" which is what Canadians call smoked meat, which is essentially pastrami, with Swiss cheese mushrooms and gravy, with a fried pickle. Like a Ruben sandwich all poutine'd up. I'd recommend getting the regular portion.. The large size may cause your arteries some trouble.Here is a recent update of my experience at poutineville, I ordered 30 minutes before closing time and they were so responsive and sweet to me!! They knew who was calling as I frequently come here .I had their julienne fries with cheese curds mozzarella and black olives ! It was amazing but I'm not a huge fan of the type of fries .. I guess I'll stick to patate douce "sweet potato" :p I came in with my order already ready packed .. I covered the charge and left within one minute. The service was fantastic. I had a delicious meal and have to thank them for being super fast and easy to take orders.I am definitely coming back again.Want some great poutine? GO HERE. My boyfriend and I were on the hunt for some poutine and came across this joint. I mean, with a name like Poutineville - it's gotta be good, right? We ordered a regular size of the house poutine and the fire breather. Both were AMAZING. I was craving something spicy so the fire breather hit the spot. I have a pretty high tolerance for spicy foods so I didn't think it was really that spicy. It was more of a moderate, enjoyable level of spicy rather than a melt-your-face-off spicy. The waiter thought I was crazy and praised my ability to finish it off without a sip of water, but in all honesty, it wasn't that bad.The house poutine was delicious - the meat melts in your mouth and has a great flavor to it. The potatoes in both were perfectly fried and bite-sized. If you're a fan of spicy things then I would definitely get the fire breather. It comes with 3 wings on top and I don't know what kind of sauce they use, but it was AMAZING. It tasted like a slightly spicy BBQ sauce. I would definitely come back for that one. Our waiter was laid back and joked around a lot - overall a really good experience.Nice little place that we tried yesterday night with some of our friends.I love poutine and my friend recommended this place so I was excited to try.After all I was really satisfied.I took the montrealer, my hubby took the fire breather.Both were tasteful with a lot of gravy and tops.If you wanna try good poutine you should come here. Probably we're coming back and try another ones.Next time maybe I will do my own combo. :)"Gravy and fries . . . I guess"Since everyone in the States always say that you HAVE to eat a Poutineville when you are in Montreal, I checked it out. Actually, this was my second time here.Sorry go against many of the reviews here but I just do not get the hype around the place. Do not get me wrong the staff and the service are GREAT and the prices are moderate but I really do not see the need to wait in a long ling for gravy and fries. The attractive feature of the place is that you can create your own poutines with various combinations of potatos, meats, cheeses, veggies (who has time for those?), and sauces. I would recommend thinking outside of the box and go with the tomato sauce. Plus, you can select a small or large size. I would go with the small unless you are in severe starvation mode. Also, if you are in super starvation mode, one can get the Heart Attack poutine, which weights 15 pounds!!!! Tres grosse (a feable attempt writing in french). Wait is poutine masculine or feminine? Actually, I forget what I put in my poutine (aside from pulled pork and bacon) but it was decent. My only complaints are that the pulled pork was not as tender as I would have liked, the bacon pieces were really small, and the gravy sauce (this time I went for the "traditional gravy rather than the tomato sauce) was a little bland. I would recommend going there just for the experience and to say that you have been there. I went this time because I was traveling with someone and it was his first time in Montreal. Oh, to avoid waiting in a long line try going in the afternoon around 1pm. Also, they have added Negroni's to the cocktail list. The barender (or manager) really wanted to make sure that the Negronis were made correctly, since they are new for this establishment.I really wish the States had something like this, because poutine is such a great dish to eat when you're intoxicated (because of the starch). I customized mine to have steak and opt for chopped potatoes rather than fries, and I ordered swiss cheese, gravy, and onions to go with it. They are very large-portioned, so prepare yourself. I think customizing was better in my opinion because the pre-made poutine on the menu seemed a bit too much for me and was probably slightly pricier. I liked how the customization sheet included which toppings were free and which were costly too, which helped me in calculating on my budget for this trip! My favorite part about the poutine was how much the steak and onions were covered in their special gravy sauce! Such a messy dish, but I think this is my new guilty pleasure!The service was pretty good given how crowded the place was, but the only thing I felt uncomfortable with was how hot and humid the restaurant was and how close all the tables and chairs were! Overall, if you wanted to look for a Canadian dish like poutine, you should DEFINITELY give this place a chance. I've seen other places around the area that are less descriptive and accommodating to what you personally like as toppings, so having the freedom here to customize poutine in so many different ways, will be beneficial to your stay here in Montreal!Love the poutine. It's a huge portion they serve you. I ended up sharing the poutine with my husband. You can pick and choose any toppings you want all for roughly $9 dollars. Of course, there are additional items that costs $1 more. But it's worth it! We got the bacon (it was a bit too crunchy) and all I can taste after is the bacon. Wished I would had got the sausages instead! The cheese and gravy was just the right amount. I'm not sure how much calories I have consumed, but it was well worth it! The space was a bit too tight for my liking. I felt really really cramped in there. There was a party of 8 beside us and that wasn't very pleasant. Would love to come back here when I'm visiting Montreal again! Wish Toronto have something like this!Oh my goodness, this place was amazing.Yes, there can be quite a wait to get in. Yes, the space can be super tight. All in all, though, the wait and cramped quarters were well worth it because the food was phenomenal.Came here on a Saturday night and while the wait appeared to be daunting, we only had to wait about 20 or so minutes on the queue before we were seated. Once seated, we were able to choose from "set" poutine options or create our own concoctions. I opted to create my own poutine, which included their vegan gravy, jalapeno peppers, mushrooms, guacamole, a fried egg, and cheese curds (of course). I believe I had opted for their standard fries as well. My table and I also shared their house salad.Holy crap, was my poutine delicious. Heavy, yes, but oh so delicious. The house salad was a great idea as it really helped with the heaviness of our meal. The marinated eggplants in the salad was phenomenal. Writing this review up gives me a slight pang in my heart as I am saddened by the fact that this delicious eatery is located so far away from me. Service also happened to be excellent. I mean, what more could you ask of an establishment, honestly? I would definitely come back here in a heartbeat if I were to ever return to Montreal and I would also highly recommend anybody and everybody to check this place out if you also happen to be in Montreal.Best poutine ever! I had no idea they had these types of places! Highly recommend even for people that don't like poutine! Friendly fast service, huge portions, cold beer! Need I say more??? So damn good!! Reasonably priced too!!PoutineVille is one of my favourite restaurants in Montreal (I can expand that range to all of Canada now that they have a Toronto location as well ;-) ).I highly recommend the "patates écrasées" (which they translate as "crushed potatoes" but I've always thought sounded better as "smashed potatoes", not that I'm taking credit - that was actually put forward by a review in the now-defunct Montreal Mirror).  Since I really prefer sweet potatoes, that's what I often order nowadays, also delectable.You should definitely try the red wine sauce, and feel free to ask for a sampler of their different sauces.  All sauces except the meat sauce are vegetarian.The pictures I took were at this location, but the review applies to the Beaubien restaurant as well.  I'll be seeing you guys again soon to get my fix :-).Had the house special poutine.  Different type of poutine but really good.  Instead of french fries, it is more like home style fries.  Good service too.  Worth trying!First time eating poutine, I'm glad I tried this place. I had the classic Poutine, which was pretty awesome. The ambience was very lively and their backyard seating was perfect for the summertime. They had too many options on the menu (which is never a bad thing!) and the variety of artery clogging poutine concoctions seemed too attractive not to try, but unfortunately I could only have one. This place is a must if you're nearby. Would not recommend to people who are health nuts and don't want heavy stuff, because it's basically potato fries + gravy + cheese curds. \m/This place was good. Was it fantastically amazing? Probably not. We walked in and was casually greeted and told to sit anywhere with a table for two. Welcoming was minimal. No drink orders were even taken. We walked in at 5pm and there were just two other tables. Our table ordered the Godfather and burger with brie cheese. The burger was pretty good. The brie cheese was definitely an amazing touch. Melt in your mouth brie with extra mayo on the side. The patty itself was pretty thick. The poutine itself was also good. Tons and tons of cheese. The cheese curds did melt a lot though. I though real cheese curds didn't melt so easily or at all? I could be wrong. The eggplant was marinated and "roasted" but it tasted really sour and soggy. Overall, the poutine was a bit more sour than my liking and tastes like sour pizza toppings. Overall experience was "meh". Very minimal service. No smiles.Delicious!!!  And so good for you (not)!  Real authentic poutine in a Montreal neighbourhood. Was perfect. Delicious poutine and a perfect setting.The best poutine hands down. Smashed fries were like cottage fries. Better than getting the standard as they were crispier. You could customize your poutine. We got braised beef, mushrooms, onions and chose a mix of pepper and wine sauce.  It was amazing. I wasn't even in the mood for poutine but I had to eat it.  So glad our hotel recommended it to us. We had to hit this place a second time before we left town. Funny enough, they had a location at the next city we went to right across the street from our hotel, but by then, unfortunately, we were poutined out.First dining experience on our trip to Montreal. Came in at around 8pm, windows open, nice breeze, the place was full but not packed.The menu is really interesting, you could easily build yourself a $50 bowl of poutine if you wanted to, with all of the topping choices. The fries alone were awesome, I loved the original poutine, great flavors and nice gravy. We also ordered the 911 spicy gravy with and egg, cheese and onions, that too was awesome. Nice selection of local beers, the service was great, everyone was really friendly and they have menus in French and English! They also close late.I'm a huge fan of poutineville simply because I can make my poutine the way I want it! I'm addicted to their "home potatoes" as well! The sauce is always excellent and they get the whole "melt the cheese" thing. I like my poutines "gratinee" as well. Sorry for being a terrible human being...The price-tag is a bit more than a fast food joint but that is to be expected to get "gourmet poutine".

My only complaints are that the pulled pork was not as tender as I would have liked, the bacon pieces were really small, and the gravy sauce (this time I went for the "traditional gravy rather than the tomato sauce) was a little bland. I would recommend going there just for the experience and to say that you have been there. I went this time because I was traveling with someone and it was his first time in Montreal. Oh, to avoid waiting in a long line try going in the afternoon around 1pm. Also, they have added Negroni's to the cocktail list. The barender (or manager) really wanted to make sure that the Negronis were made correctly, since they are new for this establishment.I really wish the States had something like this, because poutine is such a great dish to eat when you're intoxicated (because of the starch). I customized mine to have steak and opt for chopped potatoes rather than fries, and I ordered swiss cheese, gravy, and onions to go with it. They are very large-portioned, so prepare yourself. I think customizing was better in my opinion because the pre-made poutine on the menu seemed a bit too much for me and was probably slightly pricier. I liked how the customization sheet included which toppings were free and which were costly too, which helped me in calculating on my budget for this trip! My favorite part about the poutine was how much the steak and onions were covered in their special gravy sauce! Such a messy dish, but I think this is my new guilty pleasure!The service was pretty good given how crowded the place was, but the only thing I felt uncomfortable with was how hot and humid the restaurant was and how close all the tables and chairs were! Overall, if you wanted to look for a Canadian dish like poutine, you should DEFINITELY give this place a chance. I've seen other places around the area that are less descriptive and accommodating to what you personally like as toppings, so having the freedom here to customize poutine in so many different ways, will be beneficial to your stay here in Montreal!Love the poutine. It's a huge portion they serve you. I ended up sharing the poutine with my husband. You can pick and choose any toppings you want all for roughly $9 dollars. Of course, there are additional items that costs $1 more. But it's worth it! We got the bacon (it was a bit too crunchy) and all I can taste after is the bacon. Wished I would had got the sausages instead! The cheese and gravy was just the right amount. I'm not sure how much calories I have consumed, but it was well worth it! The space was a bit too tight for my liking. I felt really really cramped in there. There was a party of 8 beside us and that wasn't very pleasant. Would love to come back here when I'm visiting Montreal again! Wish Toronto have something like this!Oh my goodness, this place was amazing.Yes, there can be quite a wait to get in. Yes, the space can be super tight. All in all, though, the wait and cramped quarters were well worth it because the food was phenomenal.Came here on a Saturday night and while the wait appeared to be daunting, we only had to wait about 20 or so minutes on the queue before we were seated. Once seated, we were able to choose from "set" poutine options or create our own concoctions. I opted to create my own poutine, which included their vegan gravy, jalapeno peppers, mushrooms, guacamole, a fried egg, and cheese curds (of course). I believe I had opted for their standard fries as well. My table and I also shared their house salad.Holy crap, was my poutine delicious. Heavy, yes, but oh so delicious. The house salad was a great idea as it really helped with the heaviness of our meal. The marinated eggplants in the salad was phenomenal. Writing this review up gives me a slight pang in my heart as I am saddened by the fact that this delicious eatery is located so far away from me. Service also happened to be excellent. I mean, what more could you ask of an establishment, honestly? I would definitely come back here in a heartbeat if I were to ever return to Montreal and I would also highly recommend anybody and everybody to check this place out if you also happen to be in Montreal.Best poutine ever! I had no idea they had these types of places! Highly recommend even for people that don't like poutine! Friendly fast service, huge portions, cold beer! Need I say more??? So damn good!! Reasonably priced too!!PoutineVille is one of my favourite restaurants in Montreal (I can expand that range to all of Canada now that they have a Toronto location as well ;-) ).I highly recommend the "patates écrasées" (which they translate as "crushed potatoes" but I've always thought sounded better as "smashed potatoes", not that I'm taking credit - that was actually put forward by a review in the now-defunct Montreal Mirror).  Since I really prefer sweet potatoes, that's what I often order nowadays, also delectable.You should definitely try the red wine sauce, and feel free to ask for a sampler of their different sauces.  All sauces except the meat sauce are vegetarian.The pictures I took were at this location, but the review applies to the Beaubien restaurant as well.  I'll be seeing you guys again soon to get my fix :-).Had the house special poutine.  Different type of poutine but really good.  Instead of french fries, it is more like home style fries.  Good service too.  Worth trying!First time eating poutine, I'm glad I tried this place. I had the classic Poutine, which was pretty awesome. The ambience was very lively and their backyard seating was perfect for the summertime. They had too many options on the menu (which is never a bad thing!) and the variety of artery clogging poutine concoctions seemed too attractive not to try, but unfortunately I could only have one. This place is a must if you're nearby. Would not recommend to people who are health nuts and don't want heavy stuff, because it's basically potato fries + gravy + cheese curds. \m/This place was good. Was it fantastically amazing? Probably not. We walked in and was casually greeted and told to sit anywhere with a table for two. Welcoming was minimal. No drink orders were even taken. We walked in at 5pm and there were just two other tables. Our table ordered the Godfather and burger with brie cheese. The burger was pretty good. The brie cheese was definitely an amazing touch. Melt in your mouth brie with extra mayo on the side. The patty itself was pretty thick. The poutine itself was also good. Tons and tons of cheese. The cheese curds did melt a lot though. I though real cheese curds didn't melt so easily or at all? I could be wrong. The eggplant was marinated and "roasted" but it tasted really sour and soggy. Overall, the poutine was a bit more sour than my liking and tastes like sour pizza toppings. Overall experience was "meh". Very minimal service. No smiles.Delicious!!!  And so good for you (not)!  Real authentic poutine in a Montreal neighbourhood. Was perfect. Delicious poutine and a perfect setting.The best poutine hands down. Smashed fries were like cottage fries. Better than getting the standard as they were crispier. You could customize your poutine. We got braised beef, mushrooms, onions and chose a mix of pepper and wine sauce.  It was amazing. I wasn't even in the mood for poutine but I had to eat it.  So glad our hotel recommended it to us. We had to hit this place a second time before we left town. Funny enough, they had a location at the next city we went to right across the street from our hotel, but by then, unfortunately, we were poutined out.First dining experience on our trip to Montreal. Came in at around 8pm, windows open, nice breeze, the place was full but not packed.The menu is really interesting, you could easily build yourself a $50 bowl of poutine if you wanted to, with all of the topping choices. The fries alone were awesome, I loved the original poutine, great flavors and nice gravy. We also ordered the 911 spicy gravy with and egg, cheese and onions, that too was awesome. Nice selection of local beers, the service was great, everyone was really friendly and they have menus in French and English! They also close late.I'm a huge fan of poutineville simply because I can make my poutine the way I want it! I'm addicted to their "home potatoes" as well! The sauce is always excellent and they get the whole "melt the cheese" thing. I like my poutines "gratinee" as well. Sorry for being a terrible human being...The price-tag is a bit more than a fast food joint but that is to be expected to get "gourmet poutine". Every time I came here service has been amazing and so quick. MY CREATIONS are fun to enjoy even when they don't turn out great, I can't blame them, I'm the crazy patron who always want to try something new with them. Something I never do elsewhere.Awesome place, totally recommend. Good luck on the parking though!WOW NO WORDS!!! This place was great!!!! People that worked here were super helpful and friendly. We started off with a kids meal- grilled cheese and fries ($3.75- ONLY) and they were very generous with portion. My kid loves it. We also had their beers- SOOOOO FRESH and crisp. Awesomeness. Then we ordered POUTINE of course. I got regular fries with cheese curds and gravy topped with guac. It was very good. Next time id skip the guac. Hubby got chopped fries with cheese curds and gravy topped with hot dog. He said very good. I don't eat pork. This was a great meal haha. Fries. Yum. Photo below!!! That's my mouth ha!I enjoyed the first time i came here. I enjoyed the second time i came here, but unfortunately should've stuck with the poutine i ordered the first time.The one i ordered had something like Cheese Whiz on it instead of the real cheese curds, and I've never experienced constipation in my life until after i ate this stuff. I was backed up for 2 days before this stuff cleared my system.Stay away from the Cheese Whiz poutine (that's not what it's called, but you'll know it when you see it listed on the menu)Really great place. The waiters were on point and the food as awesome. You can make your poutine!!!Alright people... For those of you unfamiliar with poutine this place is a spectacular arena to get educated on the subject. French Canadians have taken fries to the next level... They dump a ridiculous amount of unrelated food on top of a heaping pile of fries. And voila! Poutine!!!The classic is what peeps in the north east USA would refer to as Disco Fries... Cheese Curds and gravy on fries.On this visit I had "The Montrealer" which is what Canadians call smoked meat, which is essentially pastrami, with Swiss cheese mushrooms and gravy, with a fried pickle. Like a Ruben sandwich all poutine'd up. I'd recommend getting the regular portion.. The large size may cause your arteries some trouble.Here is a recent update of my experience at poutineville, I ordered 30 minutes before closing time and they were so responsive and sweet to me!! They knew who was calling as I frequently come here .I had their julienne fries with cheese curds mozzarella and black olives ! It was amazing but I'm not a huge fan of the type of fries .. I guess I'll stick to patate douce "sweet potato" :p I came in with my order already ready packed .. I covered the charge and left within one minute. The service was fantastic. I had a delicious meal and have to thank them for being super fast and easy to take orders.I am definitely coming back again.Want some great poutine? GO HERE. My boyfriend and I were on the hunt for some poutine and came across this joint. I mean, with a name like Poutineville - it's gotta be good, right? We ordered a regular size of the house poutine and the fire breather. Both were AMAZING. I was craving something spicy so the fire breather hit the spot. I have a pretty high tolerance for spicy foods so I didn't think it was really that spicy. It was more of a moderate, enjoyable level of spicy rather than a melt-your-face-off spicy. The waiter thought I was crazy and praised my ability to finish it off without a sip of water, but in all honesty, it wasn't that bad.The house poutine was delicious - the meat melts in your mouth and has a great flavor to it. The potatoes in both were perfectly fried and bite-sized. If you're a fan of spicy things then I would definitely get the fire breather. It comes with 3 wings on top and I don't know what kind of sauce they use, but it was AMAZING. It tasted like a slightly spicy BBQ sauce. I would definitely come back for that one. Our waiter was laid back and joked around a lot - overall a really good experience.Nice little place that we tried yesterday night with some of our friends.I love poutine and my friend recommended this place so I was excited to try.After all I was really satisfied.I took the montrealer, my hubby took the fire breather.Both were tasteful with a lot of gravy and tops.If you wanna try good poutine you should come here. Probably we're coming back and try another ones.Next time maybe I will do my own combo. :)"Gravy and fries . . . I guess"Since everyone in the States always say that you HAVE to eat a Poutineville when you are in Montreal, I checked it out. Actually, this was my second time here.Sorry go against many of the reviews here but I just do not get the hype around the place. Do not get me wrong the staff and the service are GREAT and the prices are moderate but I really do not see the need to wait in a long ling for gravy and fries. The attractive feature of the place is that you can create your own poutines with various combinations of potatos, meats, cheeses, veggies (who has time for those?), and sauces. I would recommend thinking outside of the box and go with the tomato sauce. Plus, you can select a small or large size. I would go with the small unless you are in severe starvation mode. Also, if you are in super starvation mode, one can get the Heart Attack poutine, which weights 15 pounds!!!! Tres grosse (a feable attempt writing in french). Wait is poutine masculine or feminine? Actually, I forget what I put in my poutine (aside from pulled pork and bacon) but it was decent.

Probably not. We walked in and was casually greeted and told to sit anywhere with a table for two. Welcoming was minimal. No drink orders were even taken. We walked in at 5pm and there were just two other tables. Our table ordered the Godfather and burger with brie cheese. The burger was pretty good. The brie cheese was definitely an amazing touch. Melt in your mouth brie with extra mayo on the side. The patty itself was pretty thick. The poutine itself was also good. Tons and tons of cheese. The cheese curds did melt a lot though. I though real cheese curds didn't melt so easily or at all? I could be wrong. The eggplant was marinated and "roasted" but it tasted really sour and soggy. Overall, the poutine was a bit more sour than my liking and tastes like sour pizza toppings. Overall experience was "meh". Very minimal service. No smiles.Delicious!!!  And so good for you (not)!  Real authentic poutine in a Montreal neighbourhood. Was perfect. Delicious poutine and a perfect setting.The best poutine hands down. Smashed fries were like cottage fries. Better than getting the standard as they were crispier. You could customize your poutine. We got braised beef, mushrooms, onions and chose a mix of pepper and wine sauce.  It was amazing. I wasn't even in the mood for poutine but I had to eat it.  So glad our hotel recommended it to us. We had to hit this place a second time before we left town. Funny enough, they had a location at the next city we went to right across the street from our hotel, but by then, unfortunately, we were poutined out.First dining experience on our trip to Montreal. Came in at around 8pm, windows open, nice breeze, the place was full but not packed.The menu is really interesting, you could easily build yourself a $50 bowl of poutine if you wanted to, with all of the topping choices. The fries alone were awesome, I loved the original poutine, great flavors and nice gravy. We also ordered the 911 spicy gravy with and egg, cheese and onions, that too was awesome. Nice selection of local beers, the service was great, everyone was really friendly and they have menus in French and English! They also close late.I'm a huge fan of poutineville simply because I can make my poutine the way I want it! I'm addicted to their "home potatoes" as well! The sauce is always excellent and they get the whole "melt the cheese" thing. I like my poutines "gratinee" as well. Sorry for being a terrible human being...The price-tag is a bit more than a fast food joint but that is to be expected to get "gourmet poutine". Every time I came here service has been amazing and so quick. MY CREATIONS are fun to enjoy even when they don't turn out great, I can't blame them, I'm the crazy patron who always want to try something new with them. Something I never do elsewhere.Awesome place, totally recommend. Good luck on the parking though!WOW NO WORDS!!! This place was great!!!! People that worked here were super helpful and friendly. We started off with a kids meal- grilled cheese and fries ($3.75- ONLY) and they were very generous with portion. My kid loves it. We also had their beers- SOOOOO FRESH and crisp. Awesomeness. Then we ordered POUTINE of course. I got regular fries with cheese curds and gravy topped with guac. It was very good. Next time id skip the guac. Hubby got chopped fries with cheese curds and gravy topped with hot dog. He said very good. I don't eat pork. This was a great meal haha. Fries. Yum. Photo below!!! That's my mouth ha!I enjoyed the first time i came here. I enjoyed the second time i came here, but unfortunately should've stuck with the poutine i ordered the first time.The one i ordered had something like Cheese Whiz on it instead of the real cheese curds, and I've never experienced constipation in my life until after i ate this stuff. I was backed up for 2 days before this stuff cleared my system.Stay away from the Cheese Whiz poutine (that's not what it's called, but you'll know it when you see it listed on the menu)Really great place. The waiters were on point and the food as awesome. You can make your poutine!!!Alright people... For those of you unfamiliar with poutine this place is a spectacular arena to get educated on the subject. French Canadians have taken fries to the next level... They dump a ridiculous amount of unrelated food on top of a heaping pile of fries. And voila! Poutine!!!The classic is what peeps in the north east USA would refer to as Disco Fries... Cheese Curds and gravy on fries.On this visit I had "The Montrealer" which is what Canadians call smoked meat, which is essentially pastrami, with Swiss cheese mushrooms and gravy, with a fried pickle. Like a Ruben sandwich all poutine'd up. I'd recommend getting the regular portion.. The large size may cause your arteries some trouble.Here is a recent update of my experience at poutineville, I ordered 30 minutes before closing time and they were so responsive and sweet to me!! They knew who was calling as I frequently come here .I had their julienne fries with cheese curds mozzarella and black olives ! It was amazing but I'm not a huge fan of the type of fries .. I guess I'll stick to patate douce "sweet potato" :p I came in with my order already ready packed .. I covered the charge and left within one minute. The service was fantastic. I had a delicious meal and have to thank them for being super fast and easy to take orders.I am definitely coming back again.Want some great poutine? GO HERE. My boyfriend and I were on the hunt for some poutine and came across this joint. I mean, with a name like Poutineville - it's gotta be good, right? We ordered a regular size of the house poutine and the fire breather. Both were AMAZING. I was craving something spicy so the fire breather hit the spot. I have a pretty high tolerance for spicy foods so I didn't think it was really that spicy. It was more of a moderate, enjoyable level of spicy rather than a melt-your-face-off spicy. The waiter thought I was crazy and praised my ability to finish it off without a sip of water, but in all honesty, it wasn't that bad.The house poutine was delicious - the meat melts in your mouth and has a great flavor to it. The potatoes in both were perfectly fried and bite-sized. If you're a fan of spicy things then I would definitely get the fire breather. It comes with 3 wings on top and I don't know what kind of sauce they use, but it was AMAZING. It tasted like a slightly spicy BBQ sauce. I would definitely come back for that one. Our waiter was laid back and joked around a lot - overall a really good experience.Nice little place that we tried yesterday night with some of our friends.I love poutine and my friend recommended this place so I was excited to try.After all I was really satisfied.I took the montrealer, my hubby took the fire breather.Both were tasteful with a lot of gravy and tops.If you wanna try good poutine you should come here. Probably we're coming back and try another ones.Next time maybe I will do my own combo. :)"Gravy and fries . . . I guess"Since everyone in the States always say that you HAVE to eat a Poutineville when you are in Montreal, I checked it out. Actually, this was my second time here.Sorry go against many of the reviews here but I just do not get the hype around the place. Do not get me wrong the staff and the service are GREAT and the prices are moderate but I really do not see the need to wait in a long ling for gravy and fries. The attractive feature of the place is that you can create your own poutines with various combinations of potatos, meats, cheeses, veggies (who has time for those?), and sauces. I would recommend thinking outside of the box and go with the tomato sauce. Plus, you can select a small or large size. I would go with the small unless you are in severe starvation mode. Also, if you are in super starvation mode, one can get the Heart Attack poutine, which weights 15 pounds!!!! Tres grosse (a feable attempt writing in french). Wait is poutine masculine or feminine? Actually, I forget what I put in my poutine (aside from pulled pork and bacon) but it was decent. My only complaints are that the pulled pork was not as tender as I would have liked, the bacon pieces were really small, and the gravy sauce (this time I went for the "traditional gravy rather than the tomato sauce) was a little bland. I would recommend going there just for the experience and to say that you have been there. I went this time because I was traveling with someone and it was his first time in Montreal. Oh, to avoid waiting in a long line try going in the afternoon around 1pm. Also, they have added Negroni's to the cocktail list. The barender (or manager) really wanted to make sure that the Negronis were made correctly, since they are new for this establishment.I really wish the States had something like this, because poutine is such a great dish to eat when you're intoxicated (because of the starch). I customized mine to have steak and opt for chopped potatoes rather than fries, and I ordered swiss cheese, gravy, and onions to go with it. They are very large-portioned, so prepare yourself. I think customizing was better in my opinion because the pre-made poutine on the menu seemed a bit too much for me and was probably slightly pricier. I liked how the customization sheet included which toppings were free and which were costly too, which helped me in calculating on my budget for this trip! My favorite part about the poutine was how much the steak and onions were covered in their special gravy sauce! Such a messy dish, but I think this is my new guilty pleasure!The service was pretty good given how crowded the place was, but the only thing I felt uncomfortable with was how hot and humid the restaurant was and how close all the tables and chairs were! Overall, if you wanted to look for a Canadian dish like poutine, you should DEFINITELY give this place a chance. I've seen other places around the area that are less descriptive and accommodating to what you personally like as toppings, so having the freedom here to customize poutine in so many different ways, will be beneficial to your stay here in Montreal!Love the poutine. It's a huge portion they serve you. I ended up sharing the poutine with my husband. You can pick and choose any toppings you want all for roughly $9 dollars. Of course, there are additional items that costs $1 more. But it's worth it! We got the bacon (it was a bit too crunchy) and all I can taste after is the bacon. Wished I would had got the sausages instead! The cheese and gravy was just the right amount. I'm not sure how much calories I have consumed, but it was well worth it! The space was a bit too tight for my liking. I felt really really cramped in there. There was a party of 8 beside us and that wasn't very pleasant. Would love to come back here when I'm visiting Montreal again! Wish Toronto have something like this!Oh my goodness, this place was amazing.Yes, there can be quite a wait to get in. Yes, the space can be super tight. All in all, though, the wait and cramped quarters were well worth it because the food was phenomenal.Came here on a Saturday night and while the wait appeared to be daunting, we only had to wait about 20 or so minutes on the queue before we were seated. Once seated, we were able to choose from "set" poutine options or create our own concoctions. I opted to create my own poutine, which included their vegan gravy, jalapeno peppers, mushrooms, guacamole, a fried egg, and cheese curds (of course). I believe I had opted for their standard fries as well. My table and I also shared their house salad.Holy crap, was my poutine delicious. Heavy, yes, but oh so delicious. The house salad was a great idea as it really helped with the heaviness of our meal. The marinated eggplants in the salad was phenomenal. Writing this review up gives me a slight pang in my heart as I am saddened by the fact that this delicious eatery is located so far away from me. Service also happened to be excellent. I mean, what more could you ask of an establishment, honestly? I would definitely come back here in a heartbeat if I were to ever return to Montreal and I would also highly recommend anybody and everybody to check this place out if you also happen to be in Montreal.Best poutine ever! I had no idea they had these types of places! Highly recommend even for people that don't like poutine! Friendly fast service, huge portions, cold beer! Need I say more??? So damn good!! Reasonably priced too!!PoutineVille is one of my favourite restaurants in Montreal (I can expand that range to all of Canada now that they have a Toronto location as well ;-) ).I highly recommend the "patates écrasées" (which they translate as "crushed potatoes" but I've always thought sounded better as "smashed potatoes", not that I'm taking credit - that was actually put forward by a review in the now-defunct Montreal Mirror).  Since I really prefer sweet potatoes, that's what I often order nowadays, also delectable.You should definitely try the red wine sauce, and feel free to ask for a sampler of their different sauces.  All sauces except the meat sauce are vegetarian.The pictures I took were at this location, but the review applies to the Beaubien restaurant as well.  I'll be seeing you guys again soon to get my fix :-).Had the house special poutine.  Different type of poutine but really good.  Instead of french fries, it is more like home style fries.  Good service too.  Worth trying!First time eating poutine, I'm glad I tried this place. I had the classic Poutine, which was pretty awesome. The ambience was very lively and their backyard seating was perfect for the summertime. They had too many options on the menu (which is never a bad thing!) and the variety of artery clogging poutine concoctions seemed too attractive not to try, but unfortunately I could only have one. This place is a must if you're nearby. Would not recommend to people who are health nuts and don't want heavy stuff, because it's basically potato fries + gravy + cheese curds. \m/This place was good. Was it fantastically amazing?

I have a pretty high tolerance for spicy foods so I didn't think it was really that spicy. It was more of a moderate, enjoyable level of spicy rather than a melt-your-face-off spicy. The waiter thought I was crazy and praised my ability to finish it off without a sip of water, but in all honesty, it wasn't that bad.The house poutine was delicious - the meat melts in your mouth and has a great flavor to it. The potatoes in both were perfectly fried and bite-sized. If you're a fan of spicy things then I would definitely get the fire breather. It comes with 3 wings on top and I don't know what kind of sauce they use, but it was AMAZING. It tasted like a slightly spicy BBQ sauce. I would definitely come back for that one. Our waiter was laid back and joked around a lot - overall a really good experience.Nice little place that we tried yesterday night with some of our friends.I love poutine and my friend recommended this place so I was excited to try.After all I was really satisfied.I took the montrealer, my hubby took the fire breather.Both were tasteful with a lot of gravy and tops.If you wanna try good poutine you should come here. Probably we're coming back and try another ones.Next time maybe I will do my own combo. :)"Gravy and fries . . . I guess"Since everyone in the States always say that you HAVE to eat a Poutineville when you are in Montreal, I checked it out. Actually, this was my second time here.Sorry go against many of the reviews here but I just do not get the hype around the place. Do not get me wrong the staff and the service are GREAT and the prices are moderate but I really do not see the need to wait in a long ling for gravy and fries. The attractive feature of the place is that you can create your own poutines with various combinations of potatos, meats, cheeses, veggies (who has time for those?), and sauces. I would recommend thinking outside of the box and go with the tomato sauce. Plus, you can select a small or large size. I would go with the small unless you are in severe starvation mode. Also, if you are in super starvation mode, one can get the Heart Attack poutine, which weights 15 pounds!!!! Tres grosse (a feable attempt writing in french). Wait is poutine masculine or feminine? Actually, I forget what I put in my poutine (aside from pulled pork and bacon) but it was decent. My only complaints are that the pulled pork was not as tender as I would have liked, the bacon pieces were really small, and the gravy sauce (this time I went for the "traditional gravy rather than the tomato sauce) was a little bland. I would recommend going there just for the experience and to say that you have been there. I went this time because I was traveling with someone and it was his first time in Montreal. Oh, to avoid waiting in a long line try going in the afternoon around 1pm. Also, they have added Negroni's to the cocktail list. The barender (or manager) really wanted to make sure that the Negronis were made correctly, since they are new for this establishment.I really wish the States had something like this, because poutine is such a great dish to eat when you're intoxicated (because of the starch). I customized mine to have steak and opt for chopped potatoes rather than fries, and I ordered swiss cheese, gravy, and onions to go with it. They are very large-portioned, so prepare yourself. I think customizing was better in my opinion because the pre-made poutine on the menu seemed a bit too much for me and was probably slightly pricier. I liked how the customization sheet included which toppings were free and which were costly too, which helped me in calculating on my budget for this trip! My favorite part about the poutine was how much the steak and onions were covered in their special gravy sauce! Such a messy dish, but I think this is my new guilty pleasure!The service was pretty good given how crowded the place was, but the only thing I felt uncomfortable with was how hot and humid the restaurant was and how close all the tables and chairs were! Overall, if you wanted to look for a Canadian dish like poutine, you should DEFINITELY give this place a chance. I've seen other places around the area that are less descriptive and accommodating to what you personally like as toppings, so having the freedom here to customize poutine in so many different ways, will be beneficial to your stay here in Montreal!Love the poutine. It's a huge portion they serve you. I ended up sharing the poutine with my husband. You can pick and choose any toppings you want all for roughly $9 dollars. Of course, there are additional items that costs $1 more. But it's worth it! We got the bacon (it was a bit too crunchy) and all I can taste after is the bacon. Wished I would had got the sausages instead! The cheese and gravy was just the right amount. I'm not sure how much calories I have consumed, but it was well worth it! The space was a bit too tight for my liking. I felt really really cramped in there. There was a party of 8 beside us and that wasn't very pleasant. Would love to come back here when I'm visiting Montreal again! Wish Toronto have something like this!Oh my goodness, this place was amazing.Yes, there can be quite a wait to get in. Yes, the space can be super tight. All in all, though, the wait and cramped quarters were well worth it because the food was phenomenal.Came here on a Saturday night and while the wait appeared to be daunting, we only had to wait about 20 or so minutes on the queue before we were seated. Once seated, we were able to choose from "set" poutine options or create our own concoctions. I opted to create my own poutine, which included their vegan gravy, jalapeno peppers, mushrooms, guacamole, a fried egg, and cheese curds (of course). I believe I had opted for their standard fries as well. My table and I also shared their house salad.Holy crap, was my poutine delicious. Heavy, yes, but oh so delicious. The house salad was a great idea as it really helped with the heaviness of our meal. The marinated eggplants in the salad was phenomenal. Writing this review up gives me a slight pang in my heart as I am saddened by the fact that this delicious eatery is located so far away from me. Service also happened to be excellent. I mean, what more could you ask of an establishment, honestly? I would definitely come back here in a heartbeat if I were to ever return to Montreal and I would also highly recommend anybody and everybody to check this place out if you also happen to be in Montreal.Best poutine ever! I had no idea they had these types of places! Highly recommend even for people that don't like poutine! Friendly fast service, huge portions, cold beer! Need I say more??? So damn good!! Reasonably priced too!!PoutineVille is one of my favourite restaurants in Montreal (I can expand that range to all of Canada now that they have a Toronto location as well ;-) ).I highly recommend the "patates écrasées" (which they translate as "crushed potatoes" but I've always thought sounded better as "smashed potatoes", not that I'm taking credit - that was actually put forward by a review in the now-defunct Montreal Mirror).  Since I really prefer sweet potatoes, that's what I often order nowadays, also delectable.You should definitely try the red wine sauce, and feel free to ask for a sampler of their different sauces.  All sauces except the meat sauce are vegetarian.The pictures I took were at this location, but the review applies to the Beaubien restaurant as well.  I'll be seeing you guys again soon to get my fix :-).Had the house special poutine.  Different type of poutine but really good.  Instead of french fries, it is more like home style fries.  Good service too.  Worth trying!First time eating poutine, I'm glad I tried this place. I had the classic Poutine, which was pretty awesome. The ambience was very lively and their backyard seating was perfect for the summertime. They had too many options on the menu (which is never a bad thing!) and the variety of artery clogging poutine concoctions seemed too attractive not to try, but unfortunately I could only have one. This place is a must if you're nearby. Would not recommend to people who are health nuts and don't want heavy stuff, because it's basically potato fries + gravy + cheese curds. \m/This place was good. Was it fantastically amazing? Probably not. We walked in and was casually greeted and told to sit anywhere with a table for two. Welcoming was minimal. No drink orders were even taken. We walked in at 5pm and there were just two other tables. Our table ordered the Godfather and burger with brie cheese. The burger was pretty good. The brie cheese was definitely an amazing touch. Melt in your mouth brie with extra mayo on the side. The patty itself was pretty thick. The poutine itself was also good. Tons and tons of cheese. The cheese curds did melt a lot though. I though real cheese curds didn't melt so easily or at all? I could be wrong. The eggplant was marinated and "roasted" but it tasted really sour and soggy. Overall, the poutine was a bit more sour than my liking and tastes like sour pizza toppings. Overall experience was "meh". Very minimal service. No smiles.Delicious!!!  And so good for you (not)!  Real authentic poutine in a Montreal neighbourhood. Was perfect. Delicious poutine and a perfect setting.The best poutine hands down. Smashed fries were like cottage fries. Better than getting the standard as they were crispier. You could customize your poutine. We got braised beef, mushrooms, onions and chose a mix of pepper and wine sauce.  It was amazing. I wasn't even in the mood for poutine but I had to eat it.  So glad our hotel recommended it to us. We had to hit this place a second time before we left town. Funny enough, they had a location at the next city we went to right across the street from our hotel, but by then, unfortunately, we were poutined out.First dining experience on our trip to Montreal. Came in at around 8pm, windows open, nice breeze, the place was full but not packed.The menu is really interesting, you could easily build yourself a $50 bowl of poutine if you wanted to, with all of the topping choices. The fries alone were awesome, I loved the original poutine, great flavors and nice gravy. We also ordered the 911 spicy gravy with and egg, cheese and onions, that too was awesome. Nice selection of local beers, the service was great, everyone was really friendly and they have menus in French and English! They also close late.I'm a huge fan of poutineville simply because I can make my poutine the way I want it! I'm addicted to their "home potatoes" as well! The sauce is always excellent and they get the whole "melt the cheese" thing. I like my poutines "gratinee" as well. Sorry for being a terrible human being...The price-tag is a bit more than a fast food joint but that is to be expected to get "gourmet poutine". Every time I came here service has been amazing and so quick. MY CREATIONS are fun to enjoy even when they don't turn out great, I can't blame them, I'm the crazy patron who always want to try something new with them. Something I never do elsewhere.Awesome place, totally recommend. Good luck on the parking though!WOW NO WORDS!!! This place was great!!!! People that worked here were super helpful and friendly. We started off with a kids meal- grilled cheese and fries ($3.75- ONLY) and they were very generous with portion. My kid loves it. We also had their beers- SOOOOO FRESH and crisp. Awesomeness. Then we ordered POUTINE of course. I got regular fries with cheese curds and gravy topped with guac. It was very good. Next time id skip the guac. Hubby got chopped fries with cheese curds and gravy topped with hot dog. He said very good. I don't eat pork. This was a great meal haha. Fries. Yum. Photo below!!! That's my mouth ha!I enjoyed the first time i came here. I enjoyed the second time i came here, but unfortunately should've stuck with the poutine i ordered the first time.The one i ordered had something like Cheese Whiz on it instead of the real cheese curds, and I've never experienced constipation in my life until after i ate this stuff. I was backed up for 2 days before this stuff cleared my system.Stay away from the Cheese Whiz poutine (that's not what it's called, but you'll know it when you see it listed on the menu)Really great place. The waiters were on point and the food as awesome. You can make your poutine!!!Alright people... For those of you unfamiliar with poutine this place is a spectacular arena to get educated on the subject. French Canadians have taken fries to the next level... They dump a ridiculous amount of unrelated food on top of a heaping pile of fries. And voila! Poutine!!!The classic is what peeps in the north east USA would refer to as Disco Fries... Cheese Curds and gravy on fries.On this visit I had "The Montrealer" which is what Canadians call smoked meat, which is essentially pastrami, with Swiss cheese mushrooms and gravy, with a fried pickle. Like a Ruben sandwich all poutine'd up. I'd recommend getting the regular portion.. The large size may cause your arteries some trouble.Here is a recent update of my experience at poutineville, I ordered 30 minutes before closing time and they were so responsive and sweet to me!! They knew who was calling as I frequently come here .I had their julienne fries with cheese curds mozzarella and black olives ! It was amazing but I'm not a huge fan of the type of fries .. I guess I'll stick to patate douce "sweet potato" :p I came in with my order already ready packed .. I covered the charge and left within one minute. The service was fantastic. I had a delicious meal and have to thank them for being super fast and easy to take orders.I am definitely coming back again.Want some great poutine? GO HERE.

The house salad was a great idea as it really helped with the heaviness of our meal. The marinated eggplants in the salad was phenomenal. Writing this review up gives me a slight pang in my heart as I am saddened by the fact that this delicious eatery is located so far away from me. Service also happened to be excellent. I mean, what more could you ask of an establishment, honestly? I would definitely come back here in a heartbeat if I were to ever return to Montreal and I would also highly recommend anybody and everybody to check this place out if you also happen to be in Montreal.Best poutine ever! I had no idea they had these types of places! Highly recommend even for people that don't like poutine! Friendly fast service, huge portions, cold beer! Need I say more??? So damn good!! Reasonably priced too!!PoutineVille is one of my favourite restaurants in Montreal (I can expand that range to all of Canada now that they have a Toronto location as well ;-) ).I highly recommend the "patates écrasées" (which they translate as "crushed potatoes" but I've always thought sounded better as "smashed potatoes", not that I'm taking credit - that was actually put forward by a review in the now-defunct Montreal Mirror).  Since I really prefer sweet potatoes, that's what I often order nowadays, also delectable.You should definitely try the red wine sauce, and feel free to ask for a sampler of their different sauces.  All sauces except the meat sauce are vegetarian.The pictures I took were at this location, but the review applies to the Beaubien restaurant as well.  I'll be seeing you guys again soon to get my fix :-).Had the house special poutine.  Different type of poutine but really good.  Instead of french fries, it is more like home style fries.  Good service too.  Worth trying!First time eating poutine, I'm glad I tried this place. I had the classic Poutine, which was pretty awesome. The ambience was very lively and their backyard seating was perfect for the summertime. They had too many options on the menu (which is never a bad thing!) and the variety of artery clogging poutine concoctions seemed too attractive not to try, but unfortunately I could only have one. This place is a must if you're nearby. Would not recommend to people who are health nuts and don't want heavy stuff, because it's basically potato fries + gravy + cheese curds. \m/This place was good. Was it fantastically amazing? Probably not. We walked in and was casually greeted and told to sit anywhere with a table for two. Welcoming was minimal. No drink orders were even taken. We walked in at 5pm and there were just two other tables. Our table ordered the Godfather and burger with brie cheese. The burger was pretty good. The brie cheese was definitely an amazing touch. Melt in your mouth brie with extra mayo on the side. The patty itself was pretty thick. The poutine itself was also good. Tons and tons of cheese. The cheese curds did melt a lot though. I though real cheese curds didn't melt so easily or at all? I could be wrong. The eggplant was marinated and "roasted" but it tasted really sour and soggy. Overall, the poutine was a bit more sour than my liking and tastes like sour pizza toppings. Overall experience was "meh". Very minimal service. No smiles.Delicious!!!  And so good for you (not)!  Real authentic poutine in a Montreal neighbourhood. Was perfect. Delicious poutine and a perfect setting.The best poutine hands down. Smashed fries were like cottage fries. Better than getting the standard as they were crispier. You could customize your poutine. We got braised beef, mushrooms, onions and chose a mix of pepper and wine sauce.  It was amazing. I wasn't even in the mood for poutine but I had to eat it.  So glad our hotel recommended it to us. We had to hit this place a second time before we left town. Funny enough, they had a location at the next city we went to right across the street from our hotel, but by then, unfortunately, we were poutined out.First dining experience on our trip to Montreal. Came in at around 8pm, windows open, nice breeze, the place was full but not packed.The menu is really interesting, you could easily build yourself a $50 bowl of poutine if you wanted to, with all of the topping choices. The fries alone were awesome, I loved the original poutine, great flavors and nice gravy. We also ordered the 911 spicy gravy with and egg, cheese and onions, that too was awesome. Nice selection of local beers, the service was great, everyone was really friendly and they have menus in French and English! They also close late.
