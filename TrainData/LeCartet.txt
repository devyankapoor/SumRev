I have been to Le Cartet a total of 5 times.  Everything is always great.  Super fresh ingredients and good service.  The wraps are great, the duck confit also great and the brunch also very good. Highly recommend itTHEY DO NOT TAKE AMERICAN EXPRESSBeen meaning to try this place for brunch for over a year now but never really wanted to brave the cold weather during the 20+ min wait outside. I finally mustered enough courage to go and boy oh boy was it worth it!We shared the Brunch cantons and the Brunch sucré.  The beans were just divine! One tiny suggestion for the crepes on the brunch sucré plate: I recommend putting that delicious candied Orange rind and raspberry sauce in the crepe as well.  They only smear some on top of it and it's simply not enough! Try the Moka noir orange.  Best coffee I've ever had.  Lastly, Stephani the waitress was amazing.  In a great mood.  :) made our brunch all the more better. After reading the reviews I expected to be waiting at least an hour! But we got to the restaurant at 10am - minutes from our hotel at nelligan.  The wait was about 5 minutes.  Very busy, every seat full, but turnover seemed very quick so we were seated promptly!They sell mimosa for early morning cures from night prior! I ordered something that sounded like eggs Benny; but they called it something else.  The food was all fresh and if I am not mistaken freshly squeezed juice.  The service was wonderful!  The food matched the service and ambiance was very high. Has all the excellent service which was prior provided in Toronto moved to Montreal? What a positive experience, everyone seemed happy but busy.  They also have a small store front at the front of the restaurant.  When we we're leaving there was a huge lineup.  Glad we got there somewhat early!!My fiance and I made Le Cartet our first grub stop after we arrived in Montreal, starving from our long drive from New York.   The line was literally out the door, with pedestrians struggling to make their way through because hungry folks in line were blocking the wide sidewalk.   Well, despite our hunger, we figured a long line is a good sign, so we waited about 20-30 minutes to get in. We were directed by a friendly staff into the loooooong restaurant.   The long dining tables, which I would unhesitatingly put into my own dining room, were very fitting given the restaurant's length.   Me like!  So we started off with 2 cappucinos.   I ordered the bowl after being informed of the size of the cup, and my fiance ordered the cup.   Yes, I eat like a fat person and it's quite embarrassing when my male partner's portions are smaller than my own.   Anywho, the cappucinos were creamy, frothy and smooth . . .  a great start to our brunch!I decided to go with the Brunch de L'Atlantique and my fiance went with Brunch des Cantons.   I love salmon so this was the perfect dish for me.   It featured a potato and salmon cake, smoked salmon over bagel and eggs with salmon, sided with salad and fruits.   My fiance's didn't appeal to me too much because I was so absorbed with my salmony meal, but his dish was by far more savory, with sausages, eggs and ham.   Both dishes came with a glass of orange juice, which really filled us up.   I left nothing but crumbs on my plate and left with a happy tummy.   Definitely worth the wait!We rented an airbnb about 3 stores down from this place and every time we stepped foot outside there was a line coming from Le Cartet that reached our door.  My first thought? "Gotta yelp this place" and I did. So we queued up on line one sunny afternoon for brunch.  The line moved slowly and a few times I almost made an about face, but thanks to this one overly enthusiastic guy behind me I toughed it out.  He raved on and on about the food to some other strangers while he waited for his girlfriend.  Some time passes, don't even know how long, and we finally get inside and get seated.  As we're sitting down I see a waiter walk by with a carafe of OJ in one hand and a bottle of champagne in another.  I told our waitress "I want that" (yes, kind of like a toddler at a candy store).  $37 gets you a bottle of champagne with a free carafe of OJ.  For two of us, we got about 5 glasses each.  Pretty sweet deal. The food here is actually really pricey for brunch dishes, averaging at about $16 per dish.  We thanked our lucky stars that the USD was strong so we balled out! I had the Brunch Des Cantons $17. 99 (English breakfast style dish: beans, ham, bacon, eggs, sausage in a cast iron skillet) and my boo thang had the Toasta Mixta $11. 29 (egg, ham, cheese, onions, and mustard sandwich).  Both dishes were overall good but they could use some tweaks.  The skillet dish was a little bland and the bread on the sandwich should've been toasted so it can hold better.  It just kept falling apart. Service was great.  Is this place worth the wait? I'm torn so I'll leave that up to you. My family and I walked to Le Cartet from our hotel in downtown Montreal and it was a fun experience.  The space is much bigger than it appears at first with smaller tables and also family style tables.  They were friendly and patient with the two year old in our group, too.  The coffee was hot and rich, as was our food.  The staff couldn't have been friendlier. I really enjoyed the cappuccino.  The food I ordered was really yummy.  I liked the blueberry yogurt with granola and fruit. One missing star is because Mr.  T.  He never likes the scrambled eggs and beans.  But his dish had them both. We were there for a weekend brunch.  Got the Brunch Sucre and Brunch des Cantons.  Both were not good.  First, we got a table that was really sloped.  After switching table, we got the food.  I had Brunch Sucre.  It was so average, nothing really stood out at all.  The pancake had some raspberry sauce on top, which was sour.  The French toast tasted like some pre-packaged banana bread.  My boyfriend had Brunch des Cantons, it was greasy.  And the dish tasted nothing spectacular.  Decor was nice. This place is amazing!!!  I'm a huge breakfast person so everywhere I go I try and find the best breakfast joint.   I'd say this is the one for Montreal.   It was very crowded on a Sunday morning as I thought it would be but there were a ton of breakfast places near by and they didn't have a line like this one did which tells you how good they are.   We waited about 10 minutes till we were finally sat but in the meantime we perused the little shop they have in front with the pate's, pastries, and jellies.   I ordered a latte which was perfect with the asparagus scrambled eggs.   The eggs were probably the best scrambled eggs I've ever had and the fruit that came with it was actually fresh and delicious.   My bf had a few pastries that they warmed up for us and all of them were delicious.   I'd definitely recommend this place!This is by far the most delicious brunch I have ever eaten.  What a great place- from decor, to staff to drinks, to food.  I am so excited to go back already! My mom and I went there early on a Saturday morning, because I was aware of the lineups later on.  We both had the brunch santé! It was so much food- all fresh and delicious! The only thing I would change is to use arugula rather than plain romain lettuce. .  But oh my god good good good! This is also the first place in Montreal where I have had excellent coffee. . .  I cannot recommend this restaurant enough!!More like 3. 5 stars.  I was fortunate enough to arrive a bit late by VIA Rail to Montreal so I did not have to wait particularly long for my table for one.  The seating is communal-esque so get ready to get comfortable with the people sitting around you.  I had the Brunch de L'Atlantique which is a salmon lovers delight.  It had a smoked salmon scramble, a salmon cream cheese bagel, a salmon cake and a salad.  The food was very good as was the coffee and the portions were very on point.  However, the brunch was very much on the spendy side.  I don't mind paying a lot for food - but there was nothing terribly unique about what I had which is why I'm knocking this place down a tad.  This is definitely a convenient and nice place to brunch, but with so many options around - I would be more open to trying different alternatives. Everything is good, the decor, the ambiance, the service and the food.  The only drawback for me is the price. . . it's a little steep for brunch. Went to have brunch here with my girlfriends and the vibe was different from all the prior times I've been here.   It could be because there were more out of towners during the weekend. Today's visit was on a Sunday, arrived in line at 11:30 and was seated at 12:25.   The food's taste and presentation was good.   I had the ham omelette grilled cheese with the right amount of mustard seeds.   The salad came pre-dressed with what tasted like Thousand Island, and I thought it was a little too much.   My fave part of this meal was the Café au Lait. . .  It is verrry good!  Just coming here for it is def worth it ;). We got to sit on the long benches with other clients and it kinda felt like Cabane a Sucre. Overall, what I learnt from today is to visit this place on the weekends. . . . . We wondered here on a Sunday AM for brunch and the line was out the door! I think we ended up waiting around 30 min so I guess it wasn't too bad.  I really dislike their system of waiting in line. . .  Can't we put down our name and number and have the restaurant call us? That way we're not stuck standing and waiting!Once inside, there are large communal tables, but we were lucky enough to get one for two.  I had their smoothie of the day to start and it was so refreshing! I liked how it just tasted like a mix of all sorts of fruits blended with light ice.  For my meal I had the Brunch Toscan.  The eggs were cooked nicely and the dish was very filling.  I wouldn't say this was the best thing I've ever eaten, but it was decent.  The reason why I'm giving it so many stars is thanks the whole ambiance of the place! There's also a little market in the front where you can buy pre packaged foods to go as well as different snacks.  It's such a cute place!Le Cartet is a very cozy and great spot for breakfast/brunch/lunch on Rue McGill in Old Montreal.  Le Cartet can be very busy on the weekend so get there early if you don't want to wait in line. We went on Sunday morning and we were seated right away.  I had a large coffee moka that was served in a bowl.  This was very good, a little weak for me, but still a nice coffee and mocha taste. I had the blueberry toast and as others have written, the portion sizes are pretty big.  This again was delicious and came with fruits and apple butter. Le Cartet is very popular is seemed with the locals and tourists.  That being so, it can get noisy.  We were there in June and they had some tables outside also.  I enjoyed Le Cartet and would go again when I return to Montreal. This place is LEGIT for brunch. Me and 3 buddies were in town for the weekend and decided to try the food on a saturday morning.  The wait was too long for inside and luckily seats were opening outside which was perfect as the weather reflected our luck.  The staff were amazing, very friendly, and very helpful.  But the food was the highlight here, it was insane! The portions were really big and perfect to fill our very hungry bellies.  The food was really outstanding, all of our dishes were incredible, I wish this place existed for us back home. If i'm ever back in Montreal I will surely be here for sure. I went here for brunch with a friend at 12 on a weekday.  Although we were disappointed to learn brunch is only on weekends, the lunch menu did not disappoint. We started with the soup of the day and a delicious maple latte.  For mains we split the duck and scalloped potatoes (potentially the best I've had) and the pulled pork.  We finished off with a piece of deliciously moist carrot cake.  Every aspect of the meal was exceptional and the restaurant has lovely vibes. Can't wait to go back for brunch!Situated in Old Port, le cartet is great to brunch at and then take a stroll along the water and enjoy the nice weather the menu options all looked delicious, but to ease my guilt about eating out so often , I finally settled on the brunch santé, which consists of organic granola with cashew nuts, yoghurt and blueberries, poached eggs on greens and whole wheat toast, goats milk cheese with pesto (which was spread on the toast), cheddar sticks with fig, and fresh fruits.  Each brunch selection also came with a glass of orange juice (with pulp :) ) and amuse-Bouche, which is bite-sized bread pudding with chocolate and caramel (if I understood correctly).  The amuse- bouche was pretty good - it wasn't too sweet.  The highlight though, was the main meal.  I really enjoyed their yogurt with granola - it tasted creamier than the yogurts I buy at the supermarket.  I also really enjoyed the poached eggs on toast - the goats cheese and pesto made it very tasty and flavourful (normally, I don't like goat cheese because I think the flavour is too strong, but this wasn't the case at all here!)My friend got the toasted banana and coconut bread, which came with fresh fruit and yogurt with blueberries.  I tried a bit of her bread, and we both enjoyed it very very much! Overall, the staff was friendly, and the food was delicious! They also have a few outdoor tables.  Will definitely be back to try their other menu items!Pros: Beautiful setting, Delicious& Fresh food, Great serviceCons: Possible wait times, Food baby inducing, Busy-Ambiance- Very nice place to have weekend brunch, a lot of sunshine and open windows perfect to cure that night before hangover.   There is seating outside at the front and inside the restaurant as well as a quaint section selling treats at the front.  Our server was phenomenal and was very enthusiastic throughout the whole service; explaining items and catering to all of our particular food needs.   Food ranges from 5-25$. -Food- Coupe Santé:  Yoghurt+ Granola+ Fruits.  Ordered this to keep it light and I was very much satisfied.  The fruits were fresh and varied,  the granola was in-house made  and still warm, and the yogurt was light and creamy.  What more can you ask for.  Trois Minutes: Two soft-boiled eggs with bio toast, duck fat potatoes, fresh fruit and jam.   Straightforward plate with quality ingredients.  We also got the organic peanut butter, which was god-sent.  -Overall- Go for weekend brunch don't be health conscious pansies like us and get the big brunch plates.  Enjoy delicious&fresh food in a beautiful setting with good company. Situated in Old Montréal, Le Cartet offers healthy yet gourmet European style breakfast at moderate pricing. For coffee, the restaurant uses Illy espresso, a great coffee with its roots in Italy, and my breakfast tea was from Paris, from the brand Kusmi Tea.  What I found interesting and thoughtful was that the milk for my tea was frothed!The restaurant opens at 7am and serves their breakfast until 11am.  We arrived at 7:30am, and by 8 o'clock, we were very surprised to see the restaurant fully packed with a line forming at the front waiting for tables! Our advice to you is to arrive before 8am and beat the morning rush.  The restaurant offers a great vibe in their loft-like space, and is a great place to bond with your colleagues or friends.  If you're looking for a quick coffee, the restaurant has an open coffee bar at the front which operates much like a café to get your caffeine fix.  They also have a great selection of pre-packaged foods for a quick lunch midday, ranging from salads, yogurt bowls, pasta, and much more. I had Le Brunch Sucre.  Because of its name, I expected most of my breakfast to be very sweet.  To my surprise, most of the foods were sweet, but very balanced.  For example, the raspberry jam on my crepe was more acidic than sweet.  This is probably because they didn't add as much sugar than your generic jam company does, which provided a much refreshing taste when eaten together with the maple syrup. The yogurt and their granola also blew me away.  The granola was tasted nothing different at the beginning, but as I kept eating it with the yogurt, I found myself tasting the ginger more gradually and realized that I didn't really need the honey to sweeten it.  This means a lot, from someone that loves their things, especially yogurt, sweet! The yogurt was great; it seemed very fresh, thick, and dense in consistency.  It balanced everything else in the bowl very well.  I saw many women ordering the yogurt bowl as part of their breakfasts, and I agree, it's a great way to start your morning!The butter and maple syrup that the restaurant provided was quite different from the typical store-bought (or mass produced) goods as well.  The butter tasted amazing, and was very light and fluffy in texture - not the hard and dense kind you see most of the time.  The apple butter on the french toast was my favourite, and had to really hold myself back from buying a jar of it on my way out.  It really was a perfect pairing with the french toast, and a great alternative to having your typical syrup and butter on it. Overall, I really recommend this breakfast to anyone that's looking for a sweet yet healthy option.  The restaurant offers breakfast every weekday from 7am-11am, and also offers a weekend brunch both Saturday and Sunday from 9am to 3:30pm. I have been to Le Cartet a total of 5 times.  Everything is always great.  Super fresh ingredients and good service.  The wraps are great, the duck confit also great and the brunch also very good.

The granola was tasted nothing different at the beginning, but as I kept eating it with the yogurt, I found myself tasting the ginger more gradually and realized that I didn't really need the honey to sweeten it.  This means a lot, from someone that loves their things, especially yogurt, sweet! The yogurt was great; it seemed very fresh, thick, and dense in consistency.  It balanced everything else in the bowl very well.  I saw many women ordering the yogurt bowl as part of their breakfasts, and I agree, it's a great way to start your morning!The butter and maple syrup that the restaurant provided was quite different from the typical store-bought (or mass produced) goods as well.  The butter tasted amazing, and was very light and fluffy in texture - not the hard and dense kind you see most of the time.  The apple butter on the french toast was my favourite, and had to really hold myself back from buying a jar of it on my way out.  It really was a perfect pairing with the french toast, and a great alternative to having your typical syrup and butter on it. Overall, I really recommend this breakfast to anyone that's looking for a sweet yet healthy option.  The restaurant offers breakfast every weekday from 7am-11am, and also offers a weekend brunch both Saturday and Sunday from 9am to 3:30pm. I have been to Le Cartet a total of 5 times.  Everything is always great.  Super fresh ingredients and good service.  The wraps are great, the duck confit also great and the brunch also very good. Highly recommend itTHEY DO NOT TAKE AMERICAN EXPRESSBeen meaning to try this place for brunch for over a year now but never really wanted to brave the cold weather during the 20+ min wait outside. I finally mustered enough courage to go and boy oh boy was it worth it!We shared the Brunch cantons and the Brunch sucré.  The beans were just divine! One tiny suggestion for the crepes on the brunch sucré plate: I recommend putting that delicious candied Orange rind and raspberry sauce in the crepe as well.  They only smear some on top of it and it's simply not enough! Try the Moka noir orange.  Best coffee I've ever had.  Lastly, Stephani the waitress was amazing.  In a great mood.  :) made our brunch all the more better. After reading the reviews I expected to be waiting at least an hour! But we got to the restaurant at 10am - minutes from our hotel at nelligan.  The wait was about 5 minutes.  Very busy, every seat full, but turnover seemed very quick so we were seated promptly!They sell mimosa for early morning cures from night prior! I ordered something that sounded like eggs Benny; but they called it something else.  The food was all fresh and if I am not mistaken freshly squeezed juice.  The service was wonderful!  The food matched the service and ambiance was very high. Has all the excellent service which was prior provided in Toronto moved to Montreal? What a positive experience, everyone seemed happy but busy.  They also have a small store front at the front of the restaurant.  When we we're leaving there was a huge lineup.  Glad we got there somewhat early!!My fiance and I made Le Cartet our first grub stop after we arrived in Montreal, starving from our long drive from New York.   The line was literally out the door, with pedestrians struggling to make their way through because hungry folks in line were blocking the wide sidewalk.   Well, despite our hunger, we figured a long line is a good sign, so we waited about 20-30 minutes to get in. We were directed by a friendly staff into the loooooong restaurant.   The long dining tables, which I would unhesitatingly put into my own dining room, were very fitting given the restaurant's length.   Me like!  So we started off with 2 cappucinos.   I ordered the bowl after being informed of the size of the cup, and my fiance ordered the cup.   Yes, I eat like a fat person and it's quite embarrassing when my male partner's portions are smaller than my own.   Anywho, the cappucinos were creamy, frothy and smooth . . .  a great start to our brunch!I decided to go with the Brunch de L'Atlantique and my fiance went with Brunch des Cantons.   I love salmon so this was the perfect dish for me.   It featured a potato and salmon cake, smoked salmon over bagel and eggs with salmon, sided with salad and fruits.   My fiance's didn't appeal to me too much because I was so absorbed with my salmony meal, but his dish was by far more savory, with sausages, eggs and ham.   Both dishes came with a glass of orange juice, which really filled us up.   I left nothing but crumbs on my plate and left with a happy tummy.   Definitely worth the wait!We rented an airbnb about 3 stores down from this place and every time we stepped foot outside there was a line coming from Le Cartet that reached our door.  My first thought? "Gotta yelp this place" and I did. So we queued up on line one sunny afternoon for brunch.  The line moved slowly and a few times I almost made an about face, but thanks to this one overly enthusiastic guy behind me I toughed it out.  He raved on and on about the food to some other strangers while he waited for his girlfriend.  Some time passes, don't even know how long, and we finally get inside and get seated.  As we're sitting down I see a waiter walk by with a carafe of OJ in one hand and a bottle of champagne in another.  I told our waitress "I want that" (yes, kind of like a toddler at a candy store).  $37 gets you a bottle of champagne with a free carafe of OJ.  For two of us, we got about 5 glasses each.  Pretty sweet deal. The food here is actually really pricey for brunch dishes, averaging at about $16 per dish.  We thanked our lucky stars that the USD was strong so we balled out! I had the Brunch Des Cantons $17. 99 (English breakfast style dish: beans, ham, bacon, eggs, sausage in a cast iron skillet) and my boo thang had the Toasta Mixta $11. 29 (egg, ham, cheese, onions, and mustard sandwich).  Both dishes were overall good but they could use some tweaks.  The skillet dish was a little bland and the bread on the sandwich should've been toasted so it can hold better.  It just kept falling apart. Service was great.  Is this place worth the wait? I'm torn so I'll leave that up to you. My family and I walked to Le Cartet from our hotel in downtown Montreal and it was a fun experience.  The space is much bigger than it appears at first with smaller tables and also family style tables.  They were friendly and patient with the two year old in our group, too.  The coffee was hot and rich, as was our food.  The staff couldn't have been friendlier. I really enjoyed the cappuccino.  The food I ordered was really yummy.  I liked the blueberry yogurt with granola and fruit. One missing star is because Mr.  T.  He never likes the scrambled eggs and beans.  But his dish had them both. We were there for a weekend brunch.  Got the Brunch Sucre and Brunch des Cantons.  Both were not good.  First, we got a table that was really sloped.  After switching table, we got the food.  I had Brunch Sucre.  It was so average, nothing really stood out at all.  The pancake had some raspberry sauce on top, which was sour.  The French toast tasted like some pre-packaged banana bread.  My boyfriend had Brunch des Cantons, it was greasy.  And the dish tasted nothing spectacular.  Decor was nice. This place is amazing!!!  I'm a huge breakfast person so everywhere I go I try and find the best breakfast joint.   I'd say this is the one for Montreal.   It was very crowded on a Sunday morning as I thought it would be but there were a ton of breakfast places near by and they didn't have a line like this one did which tells you how good they are.   We waited about 10 minutes till we were finally sat but in the meantime we perused the little shop they have in front with the pate's, pastries, and jellies.   I ordered a latte which was perfect with the asparagus scrambled eggs.   The eggs were probably the best scrambled eggs I've ever had and the fruit that came with it was actually fresh and delicious.   My bf had a few pastries that they warmed up for us and all of them were delicious.   I'd definitely recommend this place!This is by far the most delicious brunch I have ever eaten.  What a great place- from decor, to staff to drinks, to food.  I am so excited to go back already! My mom and I went there early on a Saturday morning, because I was aware of the lineups later on.  We both had the brunch santé! It was so much food- all fresh and delicious! The only thing I would change is to use arugula rather than plain romain lettuce. .  But oh my god good good good! This is also the first place in Montreal where I have had excellent coffee. . .  I cannot recommend this restaurant enough!!More like 3. 5 stars.  I was fortunate enough to arrive a bit late by VIA Rail to Montreal so I did not have to wait particularly long for my table for one.  The seating is communal-esque so get ready to get comfortable with the people sitting around you.  I had the Brunch de L'Atlantique which is a salmon lovers delight.  It had a smoked salmon scramble, a salmon cream cheese bagel, a salmon cake and a salad.  The food was very good as was the coffee and the portions were very on point.  However, the brunch was very much on the spendy side.  I don't mind paying a lot for food - but there was nothing terribly unique about what I had which is why I'm knocking this place down a tad.  This is definitely a convenient and nice place to brunch, but with so many options around - I would be more open to trying different alternatives. Everything is good, the decor, the ambiance, the service and the food.  The only drawback for me is the price. . . it's a little steep for brunch. Went to have brunch here with my girlfriends and the vibe was different from all the prior times I've been here.   It could be because there were more out of towners during the weekend. Today's visit was on a Sunday, arrived in line at 11:30 and was seated at 12:25.   The food's taste and presentation was good.   I had the ham omelette grilled cheese with the right amount of mustard seeds.   The salad came pre-dressed with what tasted like Thousand Island, and I thought it was a little too much.   My fave part of this meal was the Café au Lait. . .  It is verrry good!  Just coming here for it is def worth it ;). We got to sit on the long benches with other clients and it kinda felt like Cabane a Sucre. Overall, what I learnt from today is to visit this place on the weekends. . . . . We wondered here on a Sunday AM for brunch and the line was out the door! I think we ended up waiting around 30 min so I guess it wasn't too bad.  I really dislike their system of waiting in line. . .  Can't we put down our name and number and have the restaurant call us? That way we're not stuck standing and waiting!Once inside, there are large communal tables, but we were lucky enough to get one for two.  I had their smoothie of the day to start and it was so refreshing! I liked how it just tasted like a mix of all sorts of fruits blended with light ice.  For my meal I had the Brunch Toscan.  The eggs were cooked nicely and the dish was very filling.  I wouldn't say this was the best thing I've ever eaten, but it was decent.  The reason why I'm giving it so many stars is thanks the whole ambiance of the place! There's also a little market in the front where you can buy pre packaged foods to go as well as different snacks.  It's such a cute place!Le Cartet is a very cozy and great spot for breakfast/brunch/lunch on Rue McGill in Old Montreal.  Le Cartet can be very busy on the weekend so get there early if you don't want to wait in line. We went on Sunday morning and we were seated right away.  I had a large coffee moka that was served in a bowl.  This was very good, a little weak for me, but still a nice coffee and mocha taste. I had the blueberry toast and as others have written, the portion sizes are pretty big.  This again was delicious and came with fruits and apple butter. Le Cartet is very popular is seemed with the locals and tourists.  That being so, it can get noisy.  We were there in June and they had some tables outside also.  I enjoyed Le Cartet and would go again when I return to Montreal. This place is LEGIT for brunch. Me and 3 buddies were in town for the weekend and decided to try the food on a saturday morning.  The wait was too long for inside and luckily seats were opening outside which was perfect as the weather reflected our luck.  The staff were amazing, very friendly, and very helpful.  But the food was the highlight here, it was insane! The portions were really big and perfect to fill our very hungry bellies.  The food was really outstanding, all of our dishes were incredible, I wish this place existed for us back home. If i'm ever back in Montreal I will surely be here for sure. I went here for brunch with a friend at 12 on a weekday.  Although we were disappointed to learn brunch is only on weekends, the lunch menu did not disappoint. We started with the soup of the day and a delicious maple latte.  For mains we split the duck and scalloped potatoes (potentially the best I've had) and the pulled pork.  We finished off with a piece of deliciously moist carrot cake.  Every aspect of the meal was exceptional and the restaurant has lovely vibes. Can't wait to go back for brunch!Situated in Old Port, le cartet is great to brunch at and then take a stroll along the water and enjoy the nice weather the menu options all looked delicious, but to ease my guilt about eating out so often , I finally settled on the brunch santé, which consists of organic granola with cashew nuts, yoghurt and blueberries, poached eggs on greens and whole wheat toast, goats milk cheese with pesto (which was spread on the toast), cheddar sticks with fig, and fresh fruits.  Each brunch selection also came with a glass of orange juice (with pulp :) ) and amuse-Bouche, which is bite-sized bread pudding with chocolate and caramel (if I understood correctly).  The amuse- bouche was pretty good - it wasn't too sweet.  The highlight though, was the main meal.  I really enjoyed their yogurt with granola - it tasted creamier than the yogurts I buy at the supermarket.  I also really enjoyed the poached eggs on toast - the goats cheese and pesto made it very tasty and flavourful (normally, I don't like goat cheese because I think the flavour is too strong, but this wasn't the case at all here!)My friend got the toasted banana and coconut bread, which came with fresh fruit and yogurt with blueberries.  I tried a bit of her bread, and we both enjoyed it very very much! Overall, the staff was friendly, and the food was delicious! They also have a few outdoor tables.  Will definitely be back to try their other menu items!Pros: Beautiful setting, Delicious& Fresh food, Great serviceCons: Possible wait times, Food baby inducing, Busy-Ambiance- Very nice place to have weekend brunch, a lot of sunshine and open windows perfect to cure that night before hangover.   There is seating outside at the front and inside the restaurant as well as a quaint section selling treats at the front.  Our server was phenomenal and was very enthusiastic throughout the whole service; explaining items and catering to all of our particular food needs.   Food ranges from 5-25$. -Food- Coupe Santé:  Yoghurt+ Granola+ Fruits.  Ordered this to keep it light and I was very much satisfied.  The fruits were fresh and varied,  the granola was in-house made  and still warm, and the yogurt was light and creamy.  What more can you ask for.  Trois Minutes: Two soft-boiled eggs with bio toast, duck fat potatoes, fresh fruit and jam.   Straightforward plate with quality ingredients.  We also got the organic peanut butter, which was god-sent.  -Overall- Go for weekend brunch don't be health conscious pansies like us and get the big brunch plates.  Enjoy delicious&fresh food in a beautiful setting with good company. Situated in Old Montréal, Le Cartet offers healthy yet gourmet European style breakfast at moderate pricing. For coffee, the restaurant uses Illy espresso, a great coffee with its roots in Italy, and my breakfast tea was from Paris, from the brand Kusmi Tea.  What I found interesting and thoughtful was that the milk for my tea was frothed!The restaurant opens at 7am and serves their breakfast until 11am.  We arrived at 7:30am, and by 8 o'clock, we were very surprised to see the restaurant fully packed with a line forming at the front waiting for tables! Our advice to you is to arrive before 8am and beat the morning rush.  The restaurant offers a great vibe in their loft-like space, and is a great place to bond with your colleagues or friends.  If you're looking for a quick coffee, the restaurant has an open coffee bar at the front which operates much like a café to get your caffeine fix.  They also have a great selection of pre-packaged foods for a quick lunch midday, ranging from salads, yogurt bowls, pasta, and much more. I had Le Brunch Sucre.  Because of its name, I expected most of my breakfast to be very sweet.  To my surprise, most of the foods were sweet, but very balanced.  For example, the raspberry jam on my crepe was more acidic than sweet.  This is probably because they didn't add as much sugar than your generic jam company does, which provided a much refreshing taste when eaten together with the maple syrup. The yogurt and their granola also blew me away.  The granola was tasted nothing different at the beginning, but as I kept eating it with the yogurt, I found myself tasting the ginger more gradually and realized that I didn't really need the honey to sweeten it.  This means a lot, from someone that loves their things, especially yogurt, sweet! The yogurt was great; it seemed very fresh, thick, and dense in consistency.

Enjoy delicious&fresh food in a beautiful setting with good company. Situated in Old Montréal, Le Cartet offers healthy yet gourmet European style breakfast at moderate pricing. For coffee, the restaurant uses Illy espresso, a great coffee with its roots in Italy, and my breakfast tea was from Paris, from the brand Kusmi Tea.  What I found interesting and thoughtful was that the milk for my tea was frothed!The restaurant opens at 7am and serves their breakfast until 11am.  We arrived at 7:30am, and by 8 o'clock, we were very surprised to see the restaurant fully packed with a line forming at the front waiting for tables! Our advice to you is to arrive before 8am and beat the morning rush.  The restaurant offers a great vibe in their loft-like space, and is a great place to bond with your colleagues or friends.  If you're looking for a quick coffee, the restaurant has an open coffee bar at the front which operates much like a café to get your caffeine fix.  They also have a great selection of pre-packaged foods for a quick lunch midday, ranging from salads, yogurt bowls, pasta, and much more. I had Le Brunch Sucre.  Because of its name, I expected most of my breakfast to be very sweet.  To my surprise, most of the foods were sweet, but very balanced.  For example, the raspberry jam on my crepe was more acidic than sweet.  This is probably because they didn't add as much sugar than your generic jam company does, which provided a much refreshing taste when eaten together with the maple syrup. The yogurt and their granola also blew me away.  The granola was tasted nothing different at the beginning, but as I kept eating it with the yogurt, I found myself tasting the ginger more gradually and realized that I didn't really need the honey to sweeten it.  This means a lot, from someone that loves their things, especially yogurt, sweet! The yogurt was great; it seemed very fresh, thick, and dense in consistency.  It balanced everything else in the bowl very well.  I saw many women ordering the yogurt bowl as part of their breakfasts, and I agree, it's a great way to start your morning!The butter and maple syrup that the restaurant provided was quite different from the typical store-bought (or mass produced) goods as well.  The butter tasted amazing, and was very light and fluffy in texture - not the hard and dense kind you see most of the time.  The apple butter on the french toast was my favourite, and had to really hold myself back from buying a jar of it on my way out.  It really was a perfect pairing with the french toast, and a great alternative to having your typical syrup and butter on it. Overall, I really recommend this breakfast to anyone that's looking for a sweet yet healthy option.  The restaurant offers breakfast every weekday from 7am-11am, and also offers a weekend brunch both Saturday and Sunday from 9am to 3:30pm. I have been to Le Cartet a total of 5 times.  Everything is always great.  Super fresh ingredients and good service.  The wraps are great, the duck confit also great and the brunch also very good. Highly recommend itTHEY DO NOT TAKE AMERICAN EXPRESSBeen meaning to try this place for brunch for over a year now but never really wanted to brave the cold weather during the 20+ min wait outside. I finally mustered enough courage to go and boy oh boy was it worth it!We shared the Brunch cantons and the Brunch sucré.  The beans were just divine! One tiny suggestion for the crepes on the brunch sucré plate: I recommend putting that delicious candied Orange rind and raspberry sauce in the crepe as well.  They only smear some on top of it and it's simply not enough! Try the Moka noir orange.  Best coffee I've ever had.  Lastly, Stephani the waitress was amazing.  In a great mood.  :) made our brunch all the more better. After reading the reviews I expected to be waiting at least an hour! But we got to the restaurant at 10am - minutes from our hotel at nelligan.  The wait was about 5 minutes.  Very busy, every seat full, but turnover seemed very quick so we were seated promptly!They sell mimosa for early morning cures from night prior! I ordered something that sounded like eggs Benny; but they called it something else.  The food was all fresh and if I am not mistaken freshly squeezed juice.  The service was wonderful!  The food matched the service and ambiance was very high. Has all the excellent service which was prior provided in Toronto moved to Montreal? What a positive experience, everyone seemed happy but busy.  They also have a small store front at the front of the restaurant.  When we we're leaving there was a huge lineup.  Glad we got there somewhat early!!My fiance and I made Le Cartet our first grub stop after we arrived in Montreal, starving from our long drive from New York.   The line was literally out the door, with pedestrians struggling to make their way through because hungry folks in line were blocking the wide sidewalk.   Well, despite our hunger, we figured a long line is a good sign, so we waited about 20-30 minutes to get in. We were directed by a friendly staff into the loooooong restaurant.   The long dining tables, which I would unhesitatingly put into my own dining room, were very fitting given the restaurant's length.   Me like!  So we started off with 2 cappucinos.   I ordered the bowl after being informed of the size of the cup, and my fiance ordered the cup.   Yes, I eat like a fat person and it's quite embarrassing when my male partner's portions are smaller than my own.   Anywho, the cappucinos were creamy, frothy and smooth . . .  a great start to our brunch!I decided to go with the Brunch de L'Atlantique and my fiance went with Brunch des Cantons.   I love salmon so this was the perfect dish for me.   It featured a potato and salmon cake, smoked salmon over bagel and eggs with salmon, sided with salad and fruits.   My fiance's didn't appeal to me too much because I was so absorbed with my salmony meal, but his dish was by far more savory, with sausages, eggs and ham.   Both dishes came with a glass of orange juice, which really filled us up.   I left nothing but crumbs on my plate and left with a happy tummy.   Definitely worth the wait!We rented an airbnb about 3 stores down from this place and every time we stepped foot outside there was a line coming from Le Cartet that reached our door.  My first thought? "Gotta yelp this place" and I did. So we queued up on line one sunny afternoon for brunch.  The line moved slowly and a few times I almost made an about face, but thanks to this one overly enthusiastic guy behind me I toughed it out.  He raved on and on about the food to some other strangers while he waited for his girlfriend.  Some time passes, don't even know how long, and we finally get inside and get seated.  As we're sitting down I see a waiter walk by with a carafe of OJ in one hand and a bottle of champagne in another.  I told our waitress "I want that" (yes, kind of like a toddler at a candy store).  $37 gets you a bottle of champagne with a free carafe of OJ.  For two of us, we got about 5 glasses each.  Pretty sweet deal. The food here is actually really pricey for brunch dishes, averaging at about $16 per dish.  We thanked our lucky stars that the USD was strong so we balled out! I had the Brunch Des Cantons $17. 99 (English breakfast style dish: beans, ham, bacon, eggs, sausage in a cast iron skillet) and my boo thang had the Toasta Mixta $11. 29 (egg, ham, cheese, onions, and mustard sandwich).  Both dishes were overall good but they could use some tweaks.  The skillet dish was a little bland and the bread on the sandwich should've been toasted so it can hold better.  It just kept falling apart. Service was great.  Is this place worth the wait? I'm torn so I'll leave that up to you. My family and I walked to Le Cartet from our hotel in downtown Montreal and it was a fun experience.  The space is much bigger than it appears at first with smaller tables and also family style tables.  They were friendly and patient with the two year old in our group, too.  The coffee was hot and rich, as was our food.  The staff couldn't have been friendlier. I really enjoyed the cappuccino.  The food I ordered was really yummy.  I liked the blueberry yogurt with granola and fruit. One missing star is because Mr.  T.  He never likes the scrambled eggs and beans.  But his dish had them both. We were there for a weekend brunch.  Got the Brunch Sucre and Brunch des Cantons.  Both were not good.  First, we got a table that was really sloped.  After switching table, we got the food.  I had Brunch Sucre.  It was so average, nothing really stood out at all.  The pancake had some raspberry sauce on top, which was sour.  The French toast tasted like some pre-packaged banana bread.  My boyfriend had Brunch des Cantons, it was greasy.  And the dish tasted nothing spectacular.  Decor was nice. This place is amazing!!!  I'm a huge breakfast person so everywhere I go I try and find the best breakfast joint.   I'd say this is the one for Montreal.   It was very crowded on a Sunday morning as I thought it would be but there were a ton of breakfast places near by and they didn't have a line like this one did which tells you how good they are.   We waited about 10 minutes till we were finally sat but in the meantime we perused the little shop they have in front with the pate's, pastries, and jellies.   I ordered a latte which was perfect with the asparagus scrambled eggs.   The eggs were probably the best scrambled eggs I've ever had and the fruit that came with it was actually fresh and delicious.   My bf had a few pastries that they warmed up for us and all of them were delicious.   I'd definitely recommend this place!This is by far the most delicious brunch I have ever eaten.  What a great place- from decor, to staff to drinks, to food.  I am so excited to go back already! My mom and I went there early on a Saturday morning, because I was aware of the lineups later on.  We both had the brunch santé! It was so much food- all fresh and delicious! The only thing I would change is to use arugula rather than plain romain lettuce. .  But oh my god good good good! This is also the first place in Montreal where I have had excellent coffee. . .  I cannot recommend this restaurant enough!!More like 3. 5 stars.  I was fortunate enough to arrive a bit late by VIA Rail to Montreal so I did not have to wait particularly long for my table for one.  The seating is communal-esque so get ready to get comfortable with the people sitting around you.  I had the Brunch de L'Atlantique which is a salmon lovers delight.  It had a smoked salmon scramble, a salmon cream cheese bagel, a salmon cake and a salad.  The food was very good as was the coffee and the portions were very on point.  However, the brunch was very much on the spendy side.  I don't mind paying a lot for food - but there was nothing terribly unique about what I had which is why I'm knocking this place down a tad.  This is definitely a convenient and nice place to brunch, but with so many options around - I would be more open to trying different alternatives. Everything is good, the decor, the ambiance, the service and the food.  The only drawback for me is the price. . . it's a little steep for brunch. Went to have brunch here with my girlfriends and the vibe was different from all the prior times I've been here.   It could be because there were more out of towners during the weekend. Today's visit was on a Sunday, arrived in line at 11:30 and was seated at 12:25.   The food's taste and presentation was good.   I had the ham omelette grilled cheese with the right amount of mustard seeds.   The salad came pre-dressed with what tasted like Thousand Island, and I thought it was a little too much.   My fave part of this meal was the Café au Lait. . .  It is verrry good!  Just coming here for it is def worth it ;). We got to sit on the long benches with other clients and it kinda felt like Cabane a Sucre. Overall, what I learnt from today is to visit this place on the weekends. . . . . We wondered here on a Sunday AM for brunch and the line was out the door! I think we ended up waiting around 30 min so I guess it wasn't too bad.  I really dislike their system of waiting in line. . .  Can't we put down our name and number and have the restaurant call us? That way we're not stuck standing and waiting!Once inside, there are large communal tables, but we were lucky enough to get one for two.  I had their smoothie of the day to start and it was so refreshing! I liked how it just tasted like a mix of all sorts of fruits blended with light ice.  For my meal I had the Brunch Toscan.  The eggs were cooked nicely and the dish was very filling.  I wouldn't say this was the best thing I've ever eaten, but it was decent.  The reason why I'm giving it so many stars is thanks the whole ambiance of the place! There's also a little market in the front where you can buy pre packaged foods to go as well as different snacks.  It's such a cute place!Le Cartet is a very cozy and great spot for breakfast/brunch/lunch on Rue McGill in Old Montreal.  Le Cartet can be very busy on the weekend so get there early if you don't want to wait in line. We went on Sunday morning and we were seated right away.  I had a large coffee moka that was served in a bowl.  This was very good, a little weak for me, but still a nice coffee and mocha taste. I had the blueberry toast and as others have written, the portion sizes are pretty big.  This again was delicious and came with fruits and apple butter. Le Cartet is very popular is seemed with the locals and tourists.  That being so, it can get noisy.  We were there in June and they had some tables outside also.  I enjoyed Le Cartet and would go again when I return to Montreal. This place is LEGIT for brunch. Me and 3 buddies were in town for the weekend and decided to try the food on a saturday morning.  The wait was too long for inside and luckily seats were opening outside which was perfect as the weather reflected our luck.  The staff were amazing, very friendly, and very helpful.  But the food was the highlight here, it was insane! The portions were really big and perfect to fill our very hungry bellies.  The food was really outstanding, all of our dishes were incredible, I wish this place existed for us back home. If i'm ever back in Montreal I will surely be here for sure. I went here for brunch with a friend at 12 on a weekday.  Although we were disappointed to learn brunch is only on weekends, the lunch menu did not disappoint. We started with the soup of the day and a delicious maple latte.  For mains we split the duck and scalloped potatoes (potentially the best I've had) and the pulled pork.  We finished off with a piece of deliciously moist carrot cake.  Every aspect of the meal was exceptional and the restaurant has lovely vibes. Can't wait to go back for brunch!Situated in Old Port, le cartet is great to brunch at and then take a stroll along the water and enjoy the nice weather the menu options all looked delicious, but to ease my guilt about eating out so often , I finally settled on the brunch santé, which consists of organic granola with cashew nuts, yoghurt and blueberries, poached eggs on greens and whole wheat toast, goats milk cheese with pesto (which was spread on the toast), cheddar sticks with fig, and fresh fruits.  Each brunch selection also came with a glass of orange juice (with pulp :) ) and amuse-Bouche, which is bite-sized bread pudding with chocolate and caramel (if I understood correctly).  The amuse- bouche was pretty good - it wasn't too sweet.  The highlight though, was the main meal.  I really enjoyed their yogurt with granola - it tasted creamier than the yogurts I buy at the supermarket.  I also really enjoyed the poached eggs on toast - the goats cheese and pesto made it very tasty and flavourful (normally, I don't like goat cheese because I think the flavour is too strong, but this wasn't the case at all here!)My friend got the toasted banana and coconut bread, which came with fresh fruit and yogurt with blueberries.  I tried a bit of her bread, and we both enjoyed it very very much! Overall, the staff was friendly, and the food was delicious! They also have a few outdoor tables.  Will definitely be back to try their other menu items!Pros: Beautiful setting, Delicious& Fresh food, Great serviceCons: Possible wait times, Food baby inducing, Busy-Ambiance- Very nice place to have weekend brunch, a lot of sunshine and open windows perfect to cure that night before hangover.   There is seating outside at the front and inside the restaurant as well as a quaint section selling treats at the front.  Our server was phenomenal and was very enthusiastic throughout the whole service; explaining items and catering to all of our particular food needs.   Food ranges from 5-25$. -Food- Coupe Santé:  Yoghurt+ Granola+ Fruits.  Ordered this to keep it light and I was very much satisfied.  The fruits were fresh and varied,  the granola was in-house made  and still warm, and the yogurt was light and creamy.  What more can you ask for.  Trois Minutes: Two soft-boiled eggs with bio toast, duck fat potatoes, fresh fruit and jam.   Straightforward plate with quality ingredients.  We also got the organic peanut butter, which was god-sent.  -Overall- Go for weekend brunch don't be health conscious pansies like us and get the big brunch plates.

I also really enjoyed the poached eggs on toast - the goats cheese and pesto made it very tasty and flavourful (normally, I don't like goat cheese because I think the flavour is too strong, but this wasn't the case at all here!)My friend got the toasted banana and coconut bread, which came with fresh fruit and yogurt with blueberries.  I tried a bit of her bread, and we both enjoyed it very very much! Overall, the staff was friendly, and the food was delicious! They also have a few outdoor tables.  Will definitely be back to try their other menu items!Pros: Beautiful setting, Delicious& Fresh food, Great serviceCons: Possible wait times, Food baby inducing, Busy-Ambiance- Very nice place to have weekend brunch, a lot of sunshine and open windows perfect to cure that night before hangover.   There is seating outside at the front and inside the restaurant as well as a quaint section selling treats at the front.  Our server was phenomenal and was very enthusiastic throughout the whole service; explaining items and catering to all of our particular food needs.   Food ranges from 5-25$. -Food- Coupe Santé:  Yoghurt+ Granola+ Fruits.  Ordered this to keep it light and I was very much satisfied.  The fruits were fresh and varied,  the granola was in-house made  and still warm, and the yogurt was light and creamy.  What more can you ask for.  Trois Minutes: Two soft-boiled eggs with bio toast, duck fat potatoes, fresh fruit and jam.   Straightforward plate with quality ingredients.  We also got the organic peanut butter, which was god-sent.  -Overall- Go for weekend brunch don't be health conscious pansies like us and get the big brunch plates.  Enjoy delicious&fresh food in a beautiful setting with good company. Situated in Old Montréal, Le Cartet offers healthy yet gourmet European style breakfast at moderate pricing. For coffee, the restaurant uses Illy espresso, a great coffee with its roots in Italy, and my breakfast tea was from Paris, from the brand Kusmi Tea.  What I found interesting and thoughtful was that the milk for my tea was frothed!The restaurant opens at 7am and serves their breakfast until 11am.  We arrived at 7:30am, and by 8 o'clock, we were very surprised to see the restaurant fully packed with a line forming at the front waiting for tables! Our advice to you is to arrive before 8am and beat the morning rush.  The restaurant offers a great vibe in their loft-like space, and is a great place to bond with your colleagues or friends.  If you're looking for a quick coffee, the restaurant has an open coffee bar at the front which operates much like a café to get your caffeine fix.  They also have a great selection of pre-packaged foods for a quick lunch midday, ranging from salads, yogurt bowls, pasta, and much more. I had Le Brunch Sucre.  Because of its name, I expected most of my breakfast to be very sweet.  To my surprise, most of the foods were sweet, but very balanced.  For example, the raspberry jam on my crepe was more acidic than sweet.  This is probably because they didn't add as much sugar than your generic jam company does, which provided a much refreshing taste when eaten together with the maple syrup. The yogurt and their granola also blew me away.  The granola was tasted nothing different at the beginning, but as I kept eating it with the yogurt, I found myself tasting the ginger more gradually and realized that I didn't really need the honey to sweeten it.  This means a lot, from someone that loves their things, especially yogurt, sweet! The yogurt was great; it seemed very fresh, thick, and dense in consistency.  It balanced everything else in the bowl very well.  I saw many women ordering the yogurt bowl as part of their breakfasts, and I agree, it's a great way to start your morning!The butter and maple syrup that the restaurant provided was quite different from the typical store-bought (or mass produced) goods as well.  The butter tasted amazing, and was very light and fluffy in texture - not the hard and dense kind you see most of the time.  The apple butter on the french toast was my favourite, and had to really hold myself back from buying a jar of it on my way out.  It really was a perfect pairing with the french toast, and a great alternative to having your typical syrup and butter on it. Overall, I really recommend this breakfast to anyone that's looking for a sweet yet healthy option.  The restaurant offers breakfast every weekday from 7am-11am, and also offers a weekend brunch both Saturday and Sunday from 9am to 3:30pm. I have been to Le Cartet a total of 5 times.  Everything is always great.  Super fresh ingredients and good service.  The wraps are great, the duck confit also great and the brunch also very good. Highly recommend itTHEY DO NOT TAKE AMERICAN EXPRESSBeen meaning to try this place for brunch for over a year now but never really wanted to brave the cold weather during the 20+ min wait outside. I finally mustered enough courage to go and boy oh boy was it worth it!We shared the Brunch cantons and the Brunch sucré.  The beans were just divine! One tiny suggestion for the crepes on the brunch sucré plate: I recommend putting that delicious candied Orange rind and raspberry sauce in the crepe as well.  They only smear some on top of it and it's simply not enough! Try the Moka noir orange.  Best coffee I've ever had.  Lastly, Stephani the waitress was amazing.  In a great mood.  :) made our brunch all the more better. After reading the reviews I expected to be waiting at least an hour! But we got to the restaurant at 10am - minutes from our hotel at nelligan.  The wait was about 5 minutes.  Very busy, every seat full, but turnover seemed very quick so we were seated promptly!They sell mimosa for early morning cures from night prior! I ordered something that sounded like eggs Benny; but they called it something else.  The food was all fresh and if I am not mistaken freshly squeezed juice.  The service was wonderful!  The food matched the service and ambiance was very high. Has all the excellent service which was prior provided in Toronto moved to Montreal? What a positive experience, everyone seemed happy but busy.  They also have a small store front at the front of the restaurant.  When we we're leaving there was a huge lineup.  Glad we got there somewhat early!!My fiance and I made Le Cartet our first grub stop after we arrived in Montreal, starving from our long drive from New York.   The line was literally out the door, with pedestrians struggling to make their way through because hungry folks in line were blocking the wide sidewalk.   Well, despite our hunger, we figured a long line is a good sign, so we waited about 20-30 minutes to get in. We were directed by a friendly staff into the loooooong restaurant.   The long dining tables, which I would unhesitatingly put into my own dining room, were very fitting given the restaurant's length.   Me like!  So we started off with 2 cappucinos.   I ordered the bowl after being informed of the size of the cup, and my fiance ordered the cup.   Yes, I eat like a fat person and it's quite embarrassing when my male partner's portions are smaller than my own.   Anywho, the cappucinos were creamy, frothy and smooth . . .  a great start to our brunch!I decided to go with the Brunch de L'Atlantique and my fiance went with Brunch des Cantons.   I love salmon so this was the perfect dish for me.   It featured a potato and salmon cake, smoked salmon over bagel and eggs with salmon, sided with salad and fruits.   My fiance's didn't appeal to me too much because I was so absorbed with my salmony meal, but his dish was by far more savory, with sausages, eggs and ham.   Both dishes came with a glass of orange juice, which really filled us up.   I left nothing but crumbs on my plate and left with a happy tummy.   Definitely worth the wait!We rented an airbnb about 3 stores down from this place and every time we stepped foot outside there was a line coming from Le Cartet that reached our door.  My first thought? "Gotta yelp this place" and I did. So we queued up on line one sunny afternoon for brunch.  The line moved slowly and a few times I almost made an about face, but thanks to this one overly enthusiastic guy behind me I toughed it out.  He raved on and on about the food to some other strangers while he waited for his girlfriend.  Some time passes, don't even know how long, and we finally get inside and get seated.  As we're sitting down I see a waiter walk by with a carafe of OJ in one hand and a bottle of champagne in another.  I told our waitress "I want that" (yes, kind of like a toddler at a candy store).  $37 gets you a bottle of champagne with a free carafe of OJ.  For two of us, we got about 5 glasses each.  Pretty sweet deal. The food here is actually really pricey for brunch dishes, averaging at about $16 per dish.  We thanked our lucky stars that the USD was strong so we balled out! I had the Brunch Des Cantons $17. 99 (English breakfast style dish: beans, ham, bacon, eggs, sausage in a cast iron skillet) and my boo thang had the Toasta Mixta $11. 29 (egg, ham, cheese, onions, and mustard sandwich).  Both dishes were overall good but they could use some tweaks.  The skillet dish was a little bland and the bread on the sandwich should've been toasted so it can hold better.  It just kept falling apart. Service was great.  Is this place worth the wait? I'm torn so I'll leave that up to you. My family and I walked to Le Cartet from our hotel in downtown Montreal and it was a fun experience.  The space is much bigger than it appears at first with smaller tables and also family style tables.  They were friendly and patient with the two year old in our group, too.  The coffee was hot and rich, as was our food.  The staff couldn't have been friendlier. I really enjoyed the cappuccino.  The food I ordered was really yummy.  I liked the blueberry yogurt with granola and fruit. One missing star is because Mr.  T.  He never likes the scrambled eggs and beans.  But his dish had them both. We were there for a weekend brunch.  Got the Brunch Sucre and Brunch des Cantons.  Both were not good.  First, we got a table that was really sloped.  After switching table, we got the food.  I had Brunch Sucre.  It was so average, nothing really stood out at all.  The pancake had some raspberry sauce on top, which was sour.  The French toast tasted like some pre-packaged banana bread.  My boyfriend had Brunch des Cantons, it was greasy.  And the dish tasted nothing spectacular.  Decor was nice. This place is amazing!!!  I'm a huge breakfast person so everywhere I go I try and find the best breakfast joint.   I'd say this is the one for Montreal.   It was very crowded on a Sunday morning as I thought it would be but there were a ton of breakfast places near by and they didn't have a line like this one did which tells you how good they are.   We waited about 10 minutes till we were finally sat but in the meantime we perused the little shop they have in front with the pate's, pastries, and jellies.   I ordered a latte which was perfect with the asparagus scrambled eggs.   The eggs were probably the best scrambled eggs I've ever had and the fruit that came with it was actually fresh and delicious.   My bf had a few pastries that they warmed up for us and all of them were delicious.   I'd definitely recommend this place!This is by far the most delicious brunch I have ever eaten.  What a great place- from decor, to staff to drinks, to food.  I am so excited to go back already! My mom and I went there early on a Saturday morning, because I was aware of the lineups later on.  We both had the brunch santé! It was so much food- all fresh and delicious! The only thing I would change is to use arugula rather than plain romain lettuce. .  But oh my god good good good! This is also the first place in Montreal where I have had excellent coffee. . .  I cannot recommend this restaurant enough!!More like 3. 5 stars.  I was fortunate enough to arrive a bit late by VIA Rail to Montreal so I did not have to wait particularly long for my table for one.  The seating is communal-esque so get ready to get comfortable with the people sitting around you.  I had the Brunch de L'Atlantique which is a salmon lovers delight.  It had a smoked salmon scramble, a salmon cream cheese bagel, a salmon cake and a salad.  The food was very good as was the coffee and the portions were very on point.  However, the brunch was very much on the spendy side.  I don't mind paying a lot for food - but there was nothing terribly unique about what I had which is why I'm knocking this place down a tad.  This is definitely a convenient and nice place to brunch, but with so many options around - I would be more open to trying different alternatives. Everything is good, the decor, the ambiance, the service and the food.  The only drawback for me is the price. . . it's a little steep for brunch. Went to have brunch here with my girlfriends and the vibe was different from all the prior times I've been here.   It could be because there were more out of towners during the weekend. Today's visit was on a Sunday, arrived in line at 11:30 and was seated at 12:25.   The food's taste and presentation was good.   I had the ham omelette grilled cheese with the right amount of mustard seeds.   The salad came pre-dressed with what tasted like Thousand Island, and I thought it was a little too much.   My fave part of this meal was the Café au Lait. . .  It is verrry good!  Just coming here for it is def worth it ;). We got to sit on the long benches with other clients and it kinda felt like Cabane a Sucre. Overall, what I learnt from today is to visit this place on the weekends. . . . . We wondered here on a Sunday AM for brunch and the line was out the door! I think we ended up waiting around 30 min so I guess it wasn't too bad.  I really dislike their system of waiting in line. . .  Can't we put down our name and number and have the restaurant call us? That way we're not stuck standing and waiting!Once inside, there are large communal tables, but we were lucky enough to get one for two.  I had their smoothie of the day to start and it was so refreshing! I liked how it just tasted like a mix of all sorts of fruits blended with light ice.  For my meal I had the Brunch Toscan.  The eggs were cooked nicely and the dish was very filling.  I wouldn't say this was the best thing I've ever eaten, but it was decent.  The reason why I'm giving it so many stars is thanks the whole ambiance of the place! There's also a little market in the front where you can buy pre packaged foods to go as well as different snacks.  It's such a cute place!Le Cartet is a very cozy and great spot for breakfast/brunch/lunch on Rue McGill in Old Montreal.  Le Cartet can be very busy on the weekend so get there early if you don't want to wait in line. We went on Sunday morning and we were seated right away.  I had a large coffee moka that was served in a bowl.  This was very good, a little weak for me, but still a nice coffee and mocha taste. I had the blueberry toast and as others have written, the portion sizes are pretty big.  This again was delicious and came with fruits and apple butter. Le Cartet is very popular is seemed with the locals and tourists.  That being so, it can get noisy.  We were there in June and they had some tables outside also.  I enjoyed Le Cartet and would go again when I return to Montreal. This place is LEGIT for brunch. Me and 3 buddies were in town for the weekend and decided to try the food on a saturday morning.  The wait was too long for inside and luckily seats were opening outside which was perfect as the weather reflected our luck.  The staff were amazing, very friendly, and very helpful.  But the food was the highlight here, it was insane! The portions were really big and perfect to fill our very hungry bellies.  The food was really outstanding, all of our dishes were incredible, I wish this place existed for us back home. If i'm ever back in Montreal I will surely be here for sure. I went here for brunch with a friend at 12 on a weekday.  Although we were disappointed to learn brunch is only on weekends, the lunch menu did not disappoint. We started with the soup of the day and a delicious maple latte.  For mains we split the duck and scalloped potatoes (potentially the best I've had) and the pulled pork.  We finished off with a piece of deliciously moist carrot cake.  Every aspect of the meal was exceptional and the restaurant has lovely vibes. Can't wait to go back for brunch!Situated in Old Port, le cartet is great to brunch at and then take a stroll along the water and enjoy the nice weather the menu options all looked delicious, but to ease my guilt about eating out so often , I finally settled on the brunch santé, which consists of organic granola with cashew nuts, yoghurt and blueberries, poached eggs on greens and whole wheat toast, goats milk cheese with pesto (which was spread on the toast), cheddar sticks with fig, and fresh fruits.  Each brunch selection also came with a glass of orange juice (with pulp :) ) and amuse-Bouche, which is bite-sized bread pudding with chocolate and caramel (if I understood correctly).  The amuse- bouche was pretty good - it wasn't too sweet.  The highlight though, was the main meal.  I really enjoyed their yogurt with granola - it tasted creamier than the yogurts I buy at the supermarket.  I also really enjoyed the poached eggs on toast - the goats cheese and pesto made it very tasty and flavourful (normally, I don't like goat cheese because I think the flavour is too strong, but this wasn't the case at all here!)My friend got the toasted banana and coconut bread, which came with fresh fruit and yogurt with blueberries.

The food was really outstanding, all of our dishes were incredible, I wish this place existed for us back home. If i'm ever back in Montreal I will surely be here for sure. I went here for brunch with a friend at 12 on a weekday.  Although we were disappointed to learn brunch is only on weekends, the lunch menu did not disappoint. We started with the soup of the day and a delicious maple latte.  For mains we split the duck and scalloped potatoes (potentially the best I've had) and the pulled pork.  We finished off with a piece of deliciously moist carrot cake.  Every aspect of the meal was exceptional and the restaurant has lovely vibes. Can't wait to go back for brunch!Situated in Old Port, le cartet is great to brunch at and then take a stroll along the water and enjoy the nice weather the menu options all looked delicious, but to ease my guilt about eating out so often , I finally settled on the brunch santé, which consists of organic granola with cashew nuts, yoghurt and blueberries, poached eggs on greens and whole wheat toast, goats milk cheese with pesto (which was spread on the toast), cheddar sticks with fig, and fresh fruits.  Each brunch selection also came with a glass of orange juice (with pulp :) ) and amuse-Bouche, which is bite-sized bread pudding with chocolate and caramel (if I understood correctly).  The amuse- bouche was pretty good - it wasn't too sweet.  The highlight though, was the main meal.  I really enjoyed their yogurt with granola - it tasted creamier than the yogurts I buy at the supermarket.  I also really enjoyed the poached eggs on toast - the goats cheese and pesto made it very tasty and flavourful (normally, I don't like goat cheese because I think the flavour is too strong, but this wasn't the case at all here!)My friend got the toasted banana and coconut bread, which came with fresh fruit and yogurt with blueberries.  I tried a bit of her bread, and we both enjoyed it very very much! Overall, the staff was friendly, and the food was delicious! They also have a few outdoor tables.  Will definitely be back to try their other menu items!Pros: Beautiful setting, Delicious& Fresh food, Great serviceCons: Possible wait times, Food baby inducing, Busy-Ambiance- Very nice place to have weekend brunch, a lot of sunshine and open windows perfect to cure that night before hangover.   There is seating outside at the front and inside the restaurant as well as a quaint section selling treats at the front.  Our server was phenomenal and was very enthusiastic throughout the whole service; explaining items and catering to all of our particular food needs.   Food ranges from 5-25$. -Food- Coupe Santé:  Yoghurt+ Granola+ Fruits.  Ordered this to keep it light and I was very much satisfied.  The fruits were fresh and varied,  the granola was in-house made  and still warm, and the yogurt was light and creamy.  What more can you ask for.  Trois Minutes: Two soft-boiled eggs with bio toast, duck fat potatoes, fresh fruit and jam.   Straightforward plate with quality ingredients.  We also got the organic peanut butter, which was god-sent.  -Overall- Go for weekend brunch don't be health conscious pansies like us and get the big brunch plates.  Enjoy delicious&fresh food in a beautiful setting with good company. Situated in Old Montréal, Le Cartet offers healthy yet gourmet European style breakfast at moderate pricing. For coffee, the restaurant uses Illy espresso, a great coffee with its roots in Italy, and my breakfast tea was from Paris, from the brand Kusmi Tea.  What I found interesting and thoughtful was that the milk for my tea was frothed!The restaurant opens at 7am and serves their breakfast until 11am.  We arrived at 7:30am, and by 8 o'clock, we were very surprised to see the restaurant fully packed with a line forming at the front waiting for tables! Our advice to you is to arrive before 8am and beat the morning rush.  The restaurant offers a great vibe in their loft-like space, and is a great place to bond with your colleagues or friends.  If you're looking for a quick coffee, the restaurant has an open coffee bar at the front which operates much like a café to get your caffeine fix.  They also have a great selection of pre-packaged foods for a quick lunch midday, ranging from salads, yogurt bowls, pasta, and much more. I had Le Brunch Sucre.  Because of its name, I expected most of my breakfast to be very sweet.  To my surprise, most of the foods were sweet, but very balanced.  For example, the raspberry jam on my crepe was more acidic than sweet.  This is probably because they didn't add as much sugar than your generic jam company does, which provided a much refreshing taste when eaten together with the maple syrup. The yogurt and their granola also blew me away.  The granola was tasted nothing different at the beginning, but as I kept eating it with the yogurt, I found myself tasting the ginger more gradually and realized that I didn't really need the honey to sweeten it.  This means a lot, from someone that loves their things, especially yogurt, sweet! The yogurt was great; it seemed very fresh, thick, and dense in consistency.  It balanced everything else in the bowl very well.  I saw many women ordering the yogurt bowl as part of their breakfasts, and I agree, it's a great way to start your morning!The butter and maple syrup that the restaurant provided was quite different from the typical store-bought (or mass produced) goods as well.  The butter tasted amazing, and was very light and fluffy in texture - not the hard and dense kind you see most of the time.  The apple butter on the french toast was my favourite, and had to really hold myself back from buying a jar of it on my way out.  It really was a perfect pairing with the french toast, and a great alternative to having your typical syrup and butter on it. Overall, I really recommend this breakfast to anyone that's looking for a sweet yet healthy option.  The restaurant offers breakfast every weekday from 7am-11am, and also offers a weekend brunch both Saturday and Sunday from 9am to 3:30pm. I have been to Le Cartet a total of 5 times.  Everything is always great.  Super fresh ingredients and good service.  The wraps are great, the duck confit also great and the brunch also very good. Highly recommend itTHEY DO NOT TAKE AMERICAN EXPRESSBeen meaning to try this place for brunch for over a year now but never really wanted to brave the cold weather during the 20+ min wait outside. I finally mustered enough courage to go and boy oh boy was it worth it!We shared the Brunch cantons and the Brunch sucré.  The beans were just divine! One tiny suggestion for the crepes on the brunch sucré plate: I recommend putting that delicious candied Orange rind and raspberry sauce in the crepe as well.  They only smear some on top of it and it's simply not enough! Try the Moka noir orange.  Best coffee I've ever had.  Lastly, Stephani the waitress was amazing.  In a great mood.  :) made our brunch all the more better. After reading the reviews I expected to be waiting at least an hour! But we got to the restaurant at 10am - minutes from our hotel at nelligan.  The wait was about 5 minutes.  Very busy, every seat full, but turnover seemed very quick so we were seated promptly!They sell mimosa for early morning cures from night prior! I ordered something that sounded like eggs Benny; but they called it something else.  The food was all fresh and if I am not mistaken freshly squeezed juice.  The service was wonderful!  The food matched the service and ambiance was very high. Has all the excellent service which was prior provided in Toronto moved to Montreal? What a positive experience, everyone seemed happy but busy.  They also have a small store front at the front of the restaurant.  When we we're leaving there was a huge lineup.  Glad we got there somewhat early!!My fiance and I made Le Cartet our first grub stop after we arrived in Montreal, starving from our long drive from New York.   The line was literally out the door, with pedestrians struggling to make their way through because hungry folks in line were blocking the wide sidewalk.   Well, despite our hunger, we figured a long line is a good sign, so we waited about 20-30 minutes to get in. We were directed by a friendly staff into the loooooong restaurant.   The long dining tables, which I would unhesitatingly put into my own dining room, were very fitting given the restaurant's length.   Me like!  So we started off with 2 cappucinos.   I ordered the bowl after being informed of the size of the cup, and my fiance ordered the cup.   Yes, I eat like a fat person and it's quite embarrassing when my male partner's portions are smaller than my own.   Anywho, the cappucinos were creamy, frothy and smooth . . .  a great start to our brunch!I decided to go with the Brunch de L'Atlantique and my fiance went with Brunch des Cantons.   I love salmon so this was the perfect dish for me.   It featured a potato and salmon cake, smoked salmon over bagel and eggs with salmon, sided with salad and fruits.   My fiance's didn't appeal to me too much because I was so absorbed with my salmony meal, but his dish was by far more savory, with sausages, eggs and ham.   Both dishes came with a glass of orange juice, which really filled us up.   I left nothing but crumbs on my plate and left with a happy tummy.   Definitely worth the wait!We rented an airbnb about 3 stores down from this place and every time we stepped foot outside there was a line coming from Le Cartet that reached our door.  My first thought? "Gotta yelp this place" and I did. So we queued up on line one sunny afternoon for brunch.  The line moved slowly and a few times I almost made an about face, but thanks to this one overly enthusiastic guy behind me I toughed it out.  He raved on and on about the food to some other strangers while he waited for his girlfriend.  Some time passes, don't even know how long, and we finally get inside and get seated.  As we're sitting down I see a waiter walk by with a carafe of OJ in one hand and a bottle of champagne in another.  I told our waitress "I want that" (yes, kind of like a toddler at a candy store).  $37 gets you a bottle of champagne with a free carafe of OJ.  For two of us, we got about 5 glasses each.  Pretty sweet deal. The food here is actually really pricey for brunch dishes, averaging at about $16 per dish.  We thanked our lucky stars that the USD was strong so we balled out! I had the Brunch Des Cantons $17. 99 (English breakfast style dish: beans, ham, bacon, eggs, sausage in a cast iron skillet) and my boo thang had the Toasta Mixta $11. 29 (egg, ham, cheese, onions, and mustard sandwich).  Both dishes were overall good but they could use some tweaks.  The skillet dish was a little bland and the bread on the sandwich should've been toasted so it can hold better.  It just kept falling apart. Service was great.  Is this place worth the wait? I'm torn so I'll leave that up to you. My family and I walked to Le Cartet from our hotel in downtown Montreal and it was a fun experience.  The space is much bigger than it appears at first with smaller tables and also family style tables.  They were friendly and patient with the two year old in our group, too.  The coffee was hot and rich, as was our food.  The staff couldn't have been friendlier. I really enjoyed the cappuccino.  The food I ordered was really yummy.  I liked the blueberry yogurt with granola and fruit. One missing star is because Mr.  T.  He never likes the scrambled eggs and beans.  But his dish had them both. We were there for a weekend brunch.  Got the Brunch Sucre and Brunch des Cantons.  Both were not good.  First, we got a table that was really sloped.  After switching table, we got the food.  I had Brunch Sucre.  It was so average, nothing really stood out at all.  The pancake had some raspberry sauce on top, which was sour.  The French toast tasted like some pre-packaged banana bread.  My boyfriend had Brunch des Cantons, it was greasy.  And the dish tasted nothing spectacular.  Decor was nice. This place is amazing!!!  I'm a huge breakfast person so everywhere I go I try and find the best breakfast joint.   I'd say this is the one for Montreal.   It was very crowded on a Sunday morning as I thought it would be but there were a ton of breakfast places near by and they didn't have a line like this one did which tells you how good they are.   We waited about 10 minutes till we were finally sat but in the meantime we perused the little shop they have in front with the pate's, pastries, and jellies.   I ordered a latte which was perfect with the asparagus scrambled eggs.   The eggs were probably the best scrambled eggs I've ever had and the fruit that came with it was actually fresh and delicious.   My bf had a few pastries that they warmed up for us and all of them were delicious.   I'd definitely recommend this place!This is by far the most delicious brunch I have ever eaten.  What a great place- from decor, to staff to drinks, to food.  I am so excited to go back already! My mom and I went there early on a Saturday morning, because I was aware of the lineups later on.  We both had the brunch santé! It was so much food- all fresh and delicious! The only thing I would change is to use arugula rather than plain romain lettuce. .  But oh my god good good good! This is also the first place in Montreal where I have had excellent coffee. . .  I cannot recommend this restaurant enough!!More like 3. 5 stars.  I was fortunate enough to arrive a bit late by VIA Rail to Montreal so I did not have to wait particularly long for my table for one.  The seating is communal-esque so get ready to get comfortable with the people sitting around you.  I had the Brunch de L'Atlantique which is a salmon lovers delight.  It had a smoked salmon scramble, a salmon cream cheese bagel, a salmon cake and a salad.  The food was very good as was the coffee and the portions were very on point.  However, the brunch was very much on the spendy side.  I don't mind paying a lot for food - but there was nothing terribly unique about what I had which is why I'm knocking this place down a tad.  This is definitely a convenient and nice place to brunch, but with so many options around - I would be more open to trying different alternatives. Everything is good, the decor, the ambiance, the service and the food.  The only drawback for me is the price. . . it's a little steep for brunch. Went to have brunch here with my girlfriends and the vibe was different from all the prior times I've been here.   It could be because there were more out of towners during the weekend. Today's visit was on a Sunday, arrived in line at 11:30 and was seated at 12:25.   The food's taste and presentation was good.   I had the ham omelette grilled cheese with the right amount of mustard seeds.   The salad came pre-dressed with what tasted like Thousand Island, and I thought it was a little too much.   My fave part of this meal was the Café au Lait. . .  It is verrry good!  Just coming here for it is def worth it ;). We got to sit on the long benches with other clients and it kinda felt like Cabane a Sucre. Overall, what I learnt from today is to visit this place on the weekends. . . . . We wondered here on a Sunday AM for brunch and the line was out the door! I think we ended up waiting around 30 min so I guess it wasn't too bad.  I really dislike their system of waiting in line. . .  Can't we put down our name and number and have the restaurant call us? That way we're not stuck standing and waiting!Once inside, there are large communal tables, but we were lucky enough to get one for two.  I had their smoothie of the day to start and it was so refreshing! I liked how it just tasted like a mix of all sorts of fruits blended with light ice.  For my meal I had the Brunch Toscan.  The eggs were cooked nicely and the dish was very filling.  I wouldn't say this was the best thing I've ever eaten, but it was decent.  The reason why I'm giving it so many stars is thanks the whole ambiance of the place! There's also a little market in the front where you can buy pre packaged foods to go as well as different snacks.  It's such a cute place!Le Cartet is a very cozy and great spot for breakfast/brunch/lunch on Rue McGill in Old Montreal.  Le Cartet can be very busy on the weekend so get there early if you don't want to wait in line. We went on Sunday morning and we were seated right away.  I had a large coffee moka that was served in a bowl.  This was very good, a little weak for me, but still a nice coffee and mocha taste. I had the blueberry toast and as others have written, the portion sizes are pretty big.  This again was delicious and came with fruits and apple butter. Le Cartet is very popular is seemed with the locals and tourists.  That being so, it can get noisy.  We were there in June and they had some tables outside also.  I enjoyed Le Cartet and would go again when I return to Montreal. This place is LEGIT for brunch. Me and 3 buddies were in town for the weekend and decided to try the food on a saturday morning.  The wait was too long for inside and luckily seats were opening outside which was perfect as the weather reflected our luck.  The staff were amazing, very friendly, and very helpful.  But the food was the highlight here, it was insane! The portions were really big and perfect to fill our very hungry bellies.

The eggs were cooked nicely and the dish was very filling.  I wouldn't say this was the best thing I've ever eaten, but it was decent.  The reason why I'm giving it so many stars is thanks the whole ambiance of the place! There's also a little market in the front where you can buy pre packaged foods to go as well as different snacks.  It's such a cute place!Le Cartet is a very cozy and great spot for breakfast/brunch/lunch on Rue McGill in Old Montreal.  Le Cartet can be very busy on the weekend so get there early if you don't want to wait in line. We went on Sunday morning and we were seated right away.  I had a large coffee moka that was served in a bowl.  This was very good, a little weak for me, but still a nice coffee and mocha taste. I had the blueberry toast and as others have written, the portion sizes are pretty big.  This again was delicious and came with fruits and apple butter. Le Cartet is very popular is seemed with the locals and tourists.  That being so, it can get noisy.  We were there in June and they had some tables outside also.  I enjoyed Le Cartet and would go again when I return to Montreal. This place is LEGIT for brunch. Me and 3 buddies were in town for the weekend and decided to try the food on a saturday morning.  The wait was too long for inside and luckily seats were opening outside which was perfect as the weather reflected our luck.  The staff were amazing, very friendly, and very helpful.  But the food was the highlight here, it was insane! The portions were really big and perfect to fill our very hungry bellies.  The food was really outstanding, all of our dishes were incredible, I wish this place existed for us back home. If i'm ever back in Montreal I will surely be here for sure. I went here for brunch with a friend at 12 on a weekday.  Although we were disappointed to learn brunch is only on weekends, the lunch menu did not disappoint. We started with the soup of the day and a delicious maple latte.  For mains we split the duck and scalloped potatoes (potentially the best I've had) and the pulled pork.  We finished off with a piece of deliciously moist carrot cake.  Every aspect of the meal was exceptional and the restaurant has lovely vibes. Can't wait to go back for brunch!Situated in Old Port, le cartet is great to brunch at and then take a stroll along the water and enjoy the nice weather the menu options all looked delicious, but to ease my guilt about eating out so often , I finally settled on the brunch santé, which consists of organic granola with cashew nuts, yoghurt and blueberries, poached eggs on greens and whole wheat toast, goats milk cheese with pesto (which was spread on the toast), cheddar sticks with fig, and fresh fruits.  Each brunch selection also came with a glass of orange juice (with pulp :) ) and amuse-Bouche, which is bite-sized bread pudding with chocolate and caramel (if I understood correctly).  The amuse- bouche was pretty good - it wasn't too sweet.  The highlight though, was the main meal.  I really enjoyed their yogurt with granola - it tasted creamier than the yogurts I buy at the supermarket.  I also really enjoyed the poached eggs on toast - the goats cheese and pesto made it very tasty and flavourful (normally, I don't like goat cheese because I think the flavour is too strong, but this wasn't the case at all here!)My friend got the toasted banana and coconut bread, which came with fresh fruit and yogurt with blueberries.  I tried a bit of her bread, and we both enjoyed it very very much! Overall, the staff was friendly, and the food was delicious! They also have a few outdoor tables.  Will definitely be back to try their other menu items!Pros: Beautiful setting, Delicious& Fresh food, Great serviceCons: Possible wait times, Food baby inducing, Busy-Ambiance- Very nice place to have weekend brunch, a lot of sunshine and open windows perfect to cure that night before hangover.   There is seating outside at the front and inside the restaurant as well as a quaint section selling treats at the front.  Our server was phenomenal and was very enthusiastic throughout the whole service; explaining items and catering to all of our particular food needs.   Food ranges from 5-25$. -Food- Coupe Santé:  Yoghurt+ Granola+ Fruits.  Ordered this to keep it light and I was very much satisfied.  The fruits were fresh and varied,  the granola was in-house made  and still warm, and the yogurt was light and creamy.  What more can you ask for.  Trois Minutes: Two soft-boiled eggs with bio toast, duck fat potatoes, fresh fruit and jam.   Straightforward plate with quality ingredients.  We also got the organic peanut butter, which was god-sent.  -Overall- Go for weekend brunch don't be health conscious pansies like us and get the big brunch plates.  Enjoy delicious&fresh food in a beautiful setting with good company. Situated in Old Montréal, Le Cartet offers healthy yet gourmet European style breakfast at moderate pricing. For coffee, the restaurant uses Illy espresso, a great coffee with its roots in Italy, and my breakfast tea was from Paris, from the brand Kusmi Tea.  What I found interesting and thoughtful was that the milk for my tea was frothed!The restaurant opens at 7am and serves their breakfast until 11am.  We arrived at 7:30am, and by 8 o'clock, we were very surprised to see the restaurant fully packed with a line forming at the front waiting for tables! Our advice to you is to arrive before 8am and beat the morning rush.  The restaurant offers a great vibe in their loft-like space, and is a great place to bond with your colleagues or friends.  If you're looking for a quick coffee, the restaurant has an open coffee bar at the front which operates much like a café to get your caffeine fix.  They also have a great selection of pre-packaged foods for a quick lunch midday, ranging from salads, yogurt bowls, pasta, and much more. I had Le Brunch Sucre.  Because of its name, I expected most of my breakfast to be very sweet.  To my surprise, most of the foods were sweet, but very balanced.  For example, the raspberry jam on my crepe was more acidic than sweet.  This is probably because they didn't add as much sugar than your generic jam company does, which provided a much refreshing taste when eaten together with the maple syrup. The yogurt and their granola also blew me away.  The granola was tasted nothing different at the beginning, but as I kept eating it with the yogurt, I found myself tasting the ginger more gradually and realized that I didn't really need the honey to sweeten it.  This means a lot, from someone that loves their things, especially yogurt, sweet! The yogurt was great; it seemed very fresh, thick, and dense in consistency.  It balanced everything else in the bowl very well.  I saw many women ordering the yogurt bowl as part of their breakfasts, and I agree, it's a great way to start your morning!The butter and maple syrup that the restaurant provided was quite different from the typical store-bought (or mass produced) goods as well.  The butter tasted amazing, and was very light and fluffy in texture - not the hard and dense kind you see most of the time.  The apple butter on the french toast was my favourite, and had to really hold myself back from buying a jar of it on my way out.  It really was a perfect pairing with the french toast, and a great alternative to having your typical syrup and butter on it. Overall, I really recommend this breakfast to anyone that's looking for a sweet yet healthy option.  The restaurant offers breakfast every weekday from 7am-11am, and also offers a weekend brunch both Saturday and Sunday from 9am to 3:30pm. I have been to Le Cartet a total of 5 times.  Everything is always great.  Super fresh ingredients and good service.  The wraps are great, the duck confit also great and the brunch also very good. Highly recommend itTHEY DO NOT TAKE AMERICAN EXPRESSBeen meaning to try this place for brunch for over a year now but never really wanted to brave the cold weather during the 20+ min wait outside. I finally mustered enough courage to go and boy oh boy was it worth it!We shared the Brunch cantons and the Brunch sucré.  The beans were just divine! One tiny suggestion for the crepes on the brunch sucré plate: I recommend putting that delicious candied Orange rind and raspberry sauce in the crepe as well.  They only smear some on top of it and it's simply not enough! Try the Moka noir orange.  Best coffee I've ever had.  Lastly, Stephani the waitress was amazing.  In a great mood.  :) made our brunch all the more better. After reading the reviews I expected to be waiting at least an hour! But we got to the restaurant at 10am - minutes from our hotel at nelligan.  The wait was about 5 minutes.  Very busy, every seat full, but turnover seemed very quick so we were seated promptly!They sell mimosa for early morning cures from night prior! I ordered something that sounded like eggs Benny; but they called it something else.  The food was all fresh and if I am not mistaken freshly squeezed juice.  The service was wonderful!  The food matched the service and ambiance was very high. Has all the excellent service which was prior provided in Toronto moved to Montreal? What a positive experience, everyone seemed happy but busy.  They also have a small store front at the front of the restaurant.  When we we're leaving there was a huge lineup.  Glad we got there somewhat early!!My fiance and I made Le Cartet our first grub stop after we arrived in Montreal, starving from our long drive from New York.   The line was literally out the door, with pedestrians struggling to make their way through because hungry folks in line were blocking the wide sidewalk.   Well, despite our hunger, we figured a long line is a good sign, so we waited about 20-30 minutes to get in. We were directed by a friendly staff into the loooooong restaurant.   The long dining tables, which I would unhesitatingly put into my own dining room, were very fitting given the restaurant's length.   Me like!  So we started off with 2 cappucinos.   I ordered the bowl after being informed of the size of the cup, and my fiance ordered the cup.   Yes, I eat like a fat person and it's quite embarrassing when my male partner's portions are smaller than my own.   Anywho, the cappucinos were creamy, frothy and smooth . . .  a great start to our brunch!I decided to go with the Brunch de L'Atlantique and my fiance went with Brunch des Cantons.   I love salmon so this was the perfect dish for me.   It featured a potato and salmon cake, smoked salmon over bagel and eggs with salmon, sided with salad and fruits.   My fiance's didn't appeal to me too much because I was so absorbed with my salmony meal, but his dish was by far more savory, with sausages, eggs and ham.   Both dishes came with a glass of orange juice, which really filled us up.   I left nothing but crumbs on my plate and left with a happy tummy.   Definitely worth the wait!We rented an airbnb about 3 stores down from this place and every time we stepped foot outside there was a line coming from Le Cartet that reached our door.  My first thought? "Gotta yelp this place" and I did. So we queued up on line one sunny afternoon for brunch.  The line moved slowly and a few times I almost made an about face, but thanks to this one overly enthusiastic guy behind me I toughed it out.  He raved on and on about the food to some other strangers while he waited for his girlfriend.  Some time passes, don't even know how long, and we finally get inside and get seated.  As we're sitting down I see a waiter walk by with a carafe of OJ in one hand and a bottle of champagne in another.  I told our waitress "I want that" (yes, kind of like a toddler at a candy store).  $37 gets you a bottle of champagne with a free carafe of OJ.  For two of us, we got about 5 glasses each.  Pretty sweet deal. The food here is actually really pricey for brunch dishes, averaging at about $16 per dish.  We thanked our lucky stars that the USD was strong so we balled out! I had the Brunch Des Cantons $17. 99 (English breakfast style dish: beans, ham, bacon, eggs, sausage in a cast iron skillet) and my boo thang had the Toasta Mixta $11. 29 (egg, ham, cheese, onions, and mustard sandwich).  Both dishes were overall good but they could use some tweaks.  The skillet dish was a little bland and the bread on the sandwich should've been toasted so it can hold better.  It just kept falling apart. Service was great.  Is this place worth the wait? I'm torn so I'll leave that up to you. My family and I walked to Le Cartet from our hotel in downtown Montreal and it was a fun experience.  The space is much bigger than it appears at first with smaller tables and also family style tables.  They were friendly and patient with the two year old in our group, too.  The coffee was hot and rich, as was our food.  The staff couldn't have been friendlier. I really enjoyed the cappuccino.  The food I ordered was really yummy.  I liked the blueberry yogurt with granola and fruit. One missing star is because Mr.  T.  He never likes the scrambled eggs and beans.  But his dish had them both. We were there for a weekend brunch.  Got the Brunch Sucre and Brunch des Cantons.  Both were not good.  First, we got a table that was really sloped.  After switching table, we got the food.  I had Brunch Sucre.  It was so average, nothing really stood out at all.  The pancake had some raspberry sauce on top, which was sour.  The French toast tasted like some pre-packaged banana bread.  My boyfriend had Brunch des Cantons, it was greasy.  And the dish tasted nothing spectacular.  Decor was nice. This place is amazing!!!  I'm a huge breakfast person so everywhere I go I try and find the best breakfast joint.   I'd say this is the one for Montreal.   It was very crowded on a Sunday morning as I thought it would be but there were a ton of breakfast places near by and they didn't have a line like this one did which tells you how good they are.   We waited about 10 minutes till we were finally sat but in the meantime we perused the little shop they have in front with the pate's, pastries, and jellies.   I ordered a latte which was perfect with the asparagus scrambled eggs.   The eggs were probably the best scrambled eggs I've ever had and the fruit that came with it was actually fresh and delicious.   My bf had a few pastries that they warmed up for us and all of them were delicious.   I'd definitely recommend this place!This is by far the most delicious brunch I have ever eaten.  What a great place- from decor, to staff to drinks, to food.  I am so excited to go back already! My mom and I went there early on a Saturday morning, because I was aware of the lineups later on.  We both had the brunch santé! It was so much food- all fresh and delicious! The only thing I would change is to use arugula rather than plain romain lettuce. .  But oh my god good good good! This is also the first place in Montreal where I have had excellent coffee. . .  I cannot recommend this restaurant enough!!More like 3. 5 stars.  I was fortunate enough to arrive a bit late by VIA Rail to Montreal so I did not have to wait particularly long for my table for one.  The seating is communal-esque so get ready to get comfortable with the people sitting around you.  I had the Brunch de L'Atlantique which is a salmon lovers delight.  It had a smoked salmon scramble, a salmon cream cheese bagel, a salmon cake and a salad.  The food was very good as was the coffee and the portions were very on point.  However, the brunch was very much on the spendy side.  I don't mind paying a lot for food - but there was nothing terribly unique about what I had which is why I'm knocking this place down a tad.  This is definitely a convenient and nice place to brunch, but with so many options around - I would be more open to trying different alternatives. Everything is good, the decor, the ambiance, the service and the food.  The only drawback for me is the price. . . it's a little steep for brunch. Went to have brunch here with my girlfriends and the vibe was different from all the prior times I've been here.   It could be because there were more out of towners during the weekend. Today's visit was on a Sunday, arrived in line at 11:30 and was seated at 12:25.   The food's taste and presentation was good.   I had the ham omelette grilled cheese with the right amount of mustard seeds.   The salad came pre-dressed with what tasted like Thousand Island, and I thought it was a little too much.   My fave part of this meal was the Café au Lait. . .  It is verrry good!  Just coming here for it is def worth it ;). We got to sit on the long benches with other clients and it kinda felt like Cabane a Sucre. Overall, what I learnt from today is to visit this place on the weekends. . . . . We wondered here on a Sunday AM for brunch and the line was out the door! I think we ended up waiting around 30 min so I guess it wasn't too bad.  I really dislike their system of waiting in line. . .  Can't we put down our name and number and have the restaurant call us? That way we're not stuck standing and waiting!Once inside, there are large communal tables, but we were lucky enough to get one for two.
