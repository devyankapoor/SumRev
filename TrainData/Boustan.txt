BOUSTAN!!! If you ever mention this name to anyone from Montreal, they will have a smile on their place.  The reason is this is the holy grail and go to place after a long night of partying.  Hits the spot every time!Super cheap and affordable.  Expect a line up especially at 2-3 am! I always get the combo plate.  It is just so fulfilling to stuff yourself with potatoes dripping of garlic and eating slices of well seasoned beef and chicken.  Both choices of meat are extremely moist and tender.  The portions are very generous and the service is great! All for under $10 as well!SECRET/HIDDEN MENU:I don't know if many people know about this. . .  but now that I am no longer in Montreal, I shall share with all of you a secret item that I found out from one of my best friends about this place.  It is called "The Creation!" Order it and thank me later.  I will keep it a surprise for you to find out!This place is like a cherry on an ice cream - best and sweetest way to end the night.  I will guarantee you that you will sleep like a baby after a long night out! Highly recommended!Lining up for Boustan's heavenly shwarma, garlic fries and friendly banter is a rite of passage for many students attending university in Montreal.  On a recent trip, I re-lived that experience and I enjoyed it as much (if not more) as I used to in the past.  The only thing that made the experience better this time was that I did not have finals/assignments etc to worry about!The shwarma was as good as I remember it being: toasty pita, with succulent crispy chicken choc-a-bloc with flavor and veggies, hummus and garlic sauce.   The accompanying garlic potatoes were gooey without being soggy and very filling.  Did I mention I am a big fan of the garlic sauce?The staffs' spirits and smiles are unfailing. As I was returning with my order, I walked passed a very drunk trio, once of whom was urinating quite proudly while standing in the middle of Crescent street.  Some things never change!Good Lebanese food and it's conveniently located on party street (crescent street) Montreal after you're done clubbing /partying. The food here is really good and the service is fast.  This is the only place I go when I'm in the mood for any Middle Eastern food really.  I love the chicken shawarma pita, that's the only thing I get there. Well known for their shawarma sandwiches, and for good reason! They're super cheap (less than $5 a pop) and they're delicious.  I had both the chicken and the beef with the works, and it was exactly what you want before a nigh of heavy drinking and bar/club hopping. They have outdoor seating as well as indoor seating with a TV in the actual restaurant.  It takes a little bit of time to get your order, but that's because they make it all fresh.  I liked the chicken more than the beef, but both had their merits. Great pit stop in between bars on Crescent. Ate here for lunch after visiting the nearby art museum.  Delicious.  Messy.  Busy, but efficient.   I had to wait out a table, but it was a good overall experience.  Pretty sure my kids would not like it, but young adults and business folk are lucky to have this place!I grabbed a quick lunch at Bouston yesterday, right before heading to the airport.  It was my last meal in Montreal and it did not disappoint. It's conveniently located on Crescent Street within stumbling distance from the bars and also within walking distance from our Sheraton hotel.  I ordered the combination plate for $10. 45 which consisted of generous portions of beef & chicken shawarma, garlic potatoes, rice, coleslaw and hummus. The plate definitely hit the spot.  The garlic potatoes are pretty addictive.  I did see the employees reheat the beef shawarma in the microwave, but i'm not mad at them.  I understand the difficulty and need to keep up with production.  The meat was still tasty.  Overall, a very good Middle Eastern / shawarma option in the area. Ordered delivery.  As always, the price is right and the pitas are tasty.  I love that they toast them.  One issue w delivery: the pitas get a little soggy.  Not their fault. . .  it's a drawback of the limits of delivery technology.  They're always perfect when I pick them up at the store and they're fresh ;-)Their fixings and other dishes are nice as well.  I particularly like their vegetarian couscous and their kibbeh. One thing I like about their delivery setup: they keep a record of your account and what you've ordered.  Since I always get the same stuff, I can simply say: give me the usual.  Super easy and quick!This place was just down the street from where we were staying and was fairly busy every time we walked by.  It's located on Crescent street by where all the bars are and I think it's smart of them to open until 4AM to get all the drunkies. I tried the chicken shawarma warp and garlic potatoes.  They're pretty fast and taking your order and making the food so it's a good place to grab a bite and go.  It's a tiny place with like 5-10 tables so it's really not a sit down place. . . The wrap was delicious and the chicken wasn't dry! The garlic potatoes are DELICIOUS!!! It's def the sauce that makes that dish.  I personally love jalapenos and got an order of them - big mistake. . .  they were sour and tasted weird.  However, I still like this place a lot because the food is good, it's fairly cheap, they're open late, and they have friendly service!Went back for the first time since "Mr.  Boustan" sold the place a few years ago.  The chicken shawarmas are still delicious, but the service took a hit.  It's still arguably the best place to grab a quick lunch around Concordia or an early morning snack after a night of drinking on Crescent Street. Chicken shwarma sandwich yes.  I could have it every day of the week.  Lunch dinner. .  I love how they grill the pita and it gets crispy. The place is small and ALWAYS crowded . .  they must be doing something right ;)TheyVe got really good food! I always get the vegetarian plate.  It's delicious!!! I like the fact that it's open till 5am every night lol . .  They can even feed crazy people at that time !! They're the best middle eastern resto by far in montreal!!This hole in the wall is absolutely so good! The food is very comforting and affordable.  The falafel wrap is crispy and flavorful.  Theres a good crunch and the wrap is grilled to perfection.  Their chicken wrap is even better! The chicken is tender and seasoned very well.  This is a great lunch and late night spot.  I recommend this place to anyone craving Lebanese food or a quick and cheap bite!Not at all like the old Boustan! Service was terrible.  Food passable.  I ended up walking out.  There still remain a few good options in Montreal, but they are getting hard to find. I went to this place with a bunch of my friends after a long night of bachelorette celebrating.  After all the years of going to Concordia, I can't believe I haven't been to this place before.  I had a simple beef sandwich/ Shawarma /wrap thing and it was fantastic! I have no idea when this place closes or if it does because I think we were there quite late/ early in the morning.  The line went right out the door it was so popular, but the people there are super efficient and the line moved quite quickly.  They have pictures of famous people who have visited posted on the walls to give you something to look at while waiting which also makes it seem less long.  This place is awesome for a late night snack and definitely makes your morning much much more pleasant after a night of drinking.  ;)I LOVE the Shawarma here. . . . I LOVE IT.  We came here for lunch first--already a line.  The owners are a bit impatient when it comes to slow customers who like to take their time looking through the menu.  It's a fairly small shop, but there's plenty of seating inside.  This was our third meal here in Montreal, and it was amazing though. So amazing that we decided for our final meal at Montreal would be Boustan.  SO, we ordered about 5 shawarma's to be delivered to our apartment that night so that we would have nomnoms waiting for us after a night at New City Gas. 4 star only because delivery took forever. . . we were told they would be at our apartment in 20 minutes, but was instead delivered about an hour later.  We even called Boustan to confirm that they didn't get lost or forgot our order.  :( Anyways, still loved the Shawarma. . . but probably wouldn't go for delivery again! Hahah. Went around lunchtime and had a great meal!  The guys behind the counter are quick and know what they are doing. After eating out at expensive restaurants for the past 5 days in Montréal, we were in search for something more casual.  We stumbled upon this place and decided to give it a shot.  When it comes to the decor and cleanliness, it may be a bit questionable, since this place doesn't aim to impress but rather just feed those who want a fast or late night hungover meal.  You have to place your oder at the counter like every other shawarma place, but the man taking my order reminded me of the 'soup nazi' form Seinfeld.  He asked for your order and assembled the food in a very strict and uniform manner with no intention to smile.  Let's just say that all the negatives were forgotten once I tasted my food.  It actually beat every other over-priced meal I had throughout my week at Montréal! The shawarma was warm, hearty, and simply amazing. My mum got the falafel plate, and I have never seen a falafel plate with so much variety.  They had potatoes, rice, pita, salads, taboulli, and so much more all in one plate. We also got the grape vines (dolmaldes), which were great too. For an affordable meal that will satisfy any craving, and right by all the lively clubs, restaurants and shopping, this place is a must-go for sure!If I'm craving shish taouk , I head over to Boustan. The trio is the perfect amount of food!The sandwich is always meaty, served hot and freaking delicious. The potatoes are salty and perfect served smothered in garlic sauce. The third part of the trio is the drink.   If you are drunk sober, kinda hungry, or really hungry, Boustan is never a disappointing choice on Crescent!Line was long going in but it was fast.  Had kefta and chicken kabob.  Was best kefta I've had and you really can't screw up chicken.  Hummus was good too.  Garlic sauce was yuk but that's a personal thing.  Basically good food cheap and a lot of it!Had the trio (drink + potatoes + schwarma sandwich).  Delicious, quick and affordable in downtown Montreal.  I would definitely return.  They take credits cards (+extra points!). BOUSTAN!!! If you ever mention this name to anyone from Montreal, they will have a smile on their place.

The only thing that made the experience better this time was that I did not have finals/assignments etc to worry about!The shwarma was as good as I remember it being: toasty pita, with succulent crispy chicken choc-a-bloc with flavor and veggies, hummus and garlic sauce.   The accompanying garlic potatoes were gooey without being soggy and very filling.  Did I mention I am a big fan of the garlic sauce?The staffs' spirits and smiles are unfailing. As I was returning with my order, I walked passed a very drunk trio, once of whom was urinating quite proudly while standing in the middle of Crescent street.  Some things never change!Good Lebanese food and it's conveniently located on party street (crescent street) Montreal after you're done clubbing /partying. The food here is really good and the service is fast.  This is the only place I go when I'm in the mood for any Middle Eastern food really.  I love the chicken shawarma pita, that's the only thing I get there. Well known for their shawarma sandwiches, and for good reason! They're super cheap (less than $5 a pop) and they're delicious.  I had both the chicken and the beef with the works, and it was exactly what you want before a nigh of heavy drinking and bar/club hopping. They have outdoor seating as well as indoor seating with a TV in the actual restaurant.  It takes a little bit of time to get your order, but that's because they make it all fresh.  I liked the chicken more than the beef, but both had their merits. Great pit stop in between bars on Crescent. Ate here for lunch after visiting the nearby art museum.  Delicious.  Messy.  Busy, but efficient.   I had to wait out a table, but it was a good overall experience.  Pretty sure my kids would not like it, but young adults and business folk are lucky to have this place!I grabbed a quick lunch at Bouston yesterday, right before heading to the airport.  It was my last meal in Montreal and it did not disappoint. It's conveniently located on Crescent Street within stumbling distance from the bars and also within walking distance from our Sheraton hotel.  I ordered the combination plate for $10. 45 which consisted of generous portions of beef & chicken shawarma, garlic potatoes, rice, coleslaw and hummus. The plate definitely hit the spot.  The garlic potatoes are pretty addictive.  I did see the employees reheat the beef shawarma in the microwave, but i'm not mad at them.  I understand the difficulty and need to keep up with production.  The meat was still tasty.  Overall, a very good Middle Eastern / shawarma option in the area. Ordered delivery.  As always, the price is right and the pitas are tasty.  I love that they toast them.  One issue w delivery: the pitas get a little soggy.  Not their fault. . .  it's a drawback of the limits of delivery technology.  They're always perfect when I pick them up at the store and they're fresh ;-)Their fixings and other dishes are nice as well.  I particularly like their vegetarian couscous and their kibbeh. One thing I like about their delivery setup: they keep a record of your account and what you've ordered.  Since I always get the same stuff, I can simply say: give me the usual.  Super easy and quick!This place was just down the street from where we were staying and was fairly busy every time we walked by.  It's located on Crescent street by where all the bars are and I think it's smart of them to open until 4AM to get all the drunkies. I tried the chicken shawarma warp and garlic potatoes.  They're pretty fast and taking your order and making the food so it's a good place to grab a bite and go.  It's a tiny place with like 5-10 tables so it's really not a sit down place. . . The wrap was delicious and the chicken wasn't dry! The garlic potatoes are DELICIOUS!!! It's def the sauce that makes that dish.  I personally love jalapenos and got an order of them - big mistake. . .  they were sour and tasted weird.  However, I still like this place a lot because the food is good, it's fairly cheap, they're open late, and they have friendly service!Went back for the first time since "Mr.  Boustan" sold the place a few years ago.  The chicken shawarmas are still delicious, but the service took a hit.  It's still arguably the best place to grab a quick lunch around Concordia or an early morning snack after a night of drinking on Crescent Street. Chicken shwarma sandwich yes.  I could have it every day of the week.  Lunch dinner. .  I love how they grill the pita and it gets crispy. The place is small and ALWAYS crowded . .  they must be doing something right ;)TheyVe got really good food! I always get the vegetarian plate.  It's delicious!!! I like the fact that it's open till 5am every night lol . .  They can even feed crazy people at that time !! They're the best middle eastern resto by far in montreal!!This hole in the wall is absolutely so good! The food is very comforting and affordable.  The falafel wrap is crispy and flavorful.  Theres a good crunch and the wrap is grilled to perfection.  Their chicken wrap is even better! The chicken is tender and seasoned very well.  This is a great lunch and late night spot.  I recommend this place to anyone craving Lebanese food or a quick and cheap bite!Not at all like the old Boustan! Service was terrible.  Food passable.  I ended up walking out.  There still remain a few good options in Montreal, but they are getting hard to find. I went to this place with a bunch of my friends after a long night of bachelorette celebrating.  After all the years of going to Concordia, I can't believe I haven't been to this place before.  I had a simple beef sandwich/ Shawarma /wrap thing and it was fantastic! I have no idea when this place closes or if it does because I think we were there quite late/ early in the morning.  The line went right out the door it was so popular, but the people there are super efficient and the line moved quite quickly.  They have pictures of famous people who have visited posted on the walls to give you something to look at while waiting which also makes it seem less long.  This place is awesome for a late night snack and definitely makes your morning much much more pleasant after a night of drinking.  ;)I LOVE the Shawarma here. . . . I LOVE IT.  We came here for lunch first--already a line.  The owners are a bit impatient when it comes to slow customers who like to take their time looking through the menu.  It's a fairly small shop, but there's plenty of seating inside.  This was our third meal here in Montreal, and it was amazing though. So amazing that we decided for our final meal at Montreal would be Boustan.  SO, we ordered about 5 shawarma's to be delivered to our apartment that night so that we would have nomnoms waiting for us after a night at New City Gas. 4 star only because delivery took forever. . . we were told they would be at our apartment in 20 minutes, but was instead delivered about an hour later.  We even called Boustan to confirm that they didn't get lost or forgot our order.  :( Anyways, still loved the Shawarma. . . but probably wouldn't go for delivery again! Hahah. Went around lunchtime and had a great meal!  The guys behind the counter are quick and know what they are doing. After eating out at expensive restaurants for the past 5 days in Montréal, we were in search for something more casual.  We stumbled upon this place and decided to give it a shot.  When it comes to the decor and cleanliness, it may be a bit questionable, since this place doesn't aim to impress but rather just feed those who want a fast or late night hungover meal.  You have to place your oder at the counter like every other shawarma place, but the man taking my order reminded me of the 'soup nazi' form Seinfeld.  He asked for your order and assembled the food in a very strict and uniform manner with no intention to smile.  Let's just say that all the negatives were forgotten once I tasted my food.  It actually beat every other over-priced meal I had throughout my week at Montréal! The shawarma was warm, hearty, and simply amazing. My mum got the falafel plate, and I have never seen a falafel plate with so much variety.  They had potatoes, rice, pita, salads, taboulli, and so much more all in one plate. We also got the grape vines (dolmaldes), which were great too. For an affordable meal that will satisfy any craving, and right by all the lively clubs, restaurants and shopping, this place is a must-go for sure!If I'm craving shish taouk , I head over to Boustan. The trio is the perfect amount of food!The sandwich is always meaty, served hot and freaking delicious. The potatoes are salty and perfect served smothered in garlic sauce. The third part of the trio is the drink.   If you are drunk sober, kinda hungry, or really hungry, Boustan is never a disappointing choice on Crescent!Line was long going in but it was fast.  Had kefta and chicken kabob.  Was best kefta I've had and you really can't screw up chicken.  Hummus was good too.  Garlic sauce was yuk but that's a personal thing.  Basically good food cheap and a lot of it!Had the trio (drink + potatoes + schwarma sandwich).  Delicious, quick and affordable in downtown Montreal.  I would definitely return.  They take credits cards (+extra points!). BOUSTAN!!! If you ever mention this name to anyone from Montreal, they will have a smile on their place.  The reason is this is the holy grail and go to place after a long night of partying.  Hits the spot every time!Super cheap and affordable.  Expect a line up especially at 2-3 am! I always get the combo plate.  It is just so fulfilling to stuff yourself with potatoes dripping of garlic and eating slices of well seasoned beef and chicken.  Both choices of meat are extremely moist and tender.  The portions are very generous and the service is great! All for under $10 as well!SECRET/HIDDEN MENU:I don't know if many people know about this. . .  but now that I am no longer in Montreal, I shall share with all of you a secret item that I found out from one of my best friends about this place.  It is called "The Creation!" Order it and thank me later.  I will keep it a surprise for you to find out!This place is like a cherry on an ice cream - best and sweetest way to end the night.  I will guarantee you that you will sleep like a baby after a long night out!

They have outdoor seating as well as indoor seating with a TV in the actual restaurant.  It takes a little bit of time to get your order, but that's because they make it all fresh.  I liked the chicken more than the beef, but both had their merits. Great pit stop in between bars on Crescent. Ate here for lunch after visiting the nearby art museum.  Delicious.  Messy.  Busy, but efficient.   I had to wait out a table, but it was a good overall experience.  Pretty sure my kids would not like it, but young adults and business folk are lucky to have this place!I grabbed a quick lunch at Bouston yesterday, right before heading to the airport.  It was my last meal in Montreal and it did not disappoint. It's conveniently located on Crescent Street within stumbling distance from the bars and also within walking distance from our Sheraton hotel.  I ordered the combination plate for $10. 45 which consisted of generous portions of beef & chicken shawarma, garlic potatoes, rice, coleslaw and hummus. The plate definitely hit the spot.  The garlic potatoes are pretty addictive.  I did see the employees reheat the beef shawarma in the microwave, but i'm not mad at them.  I understand the difficulty and need to keep up with production.  The meat was still tasty.  Overall, a very good Middle Eastern / shawarma option in the area. Ordered delivery.  As always, the price is right and the pitas are tasty.  I love that they toast them.  One issue w delivery: the pitas get a little soggy.  Not their fault. . .  it's a drawback of the limits of delivery technology.  They're always perfect when I pick them up at the store and they're fresh ;-)Their fixings and other dishes are nice as well.  I particularly like their vegetarian couscous and their kibbeh. One thing I like about their delivery setup: they keep a record of your account and what you've ordered.  Since I always get the same stuff, I can simply say: give me the usual.  Super easy and quick!This place was just down the street from where we were staying and was fairly busy every time we walked by.  It's located on Crescent street by where all the bars are and I think it's smart of them to open until 4AM to get all the drunkies. I tried the chicken shawarma warp and garlic potatoes.  They're pretty fast and taking your order and making the food so it's a good place to grab a bite and go.  It's a tiny place with like 5-10 tables so it's really not a sit down place. . . The wrap was delicious and the chicken wasn't dry! The garlic potatoes are DELICIOUS!!! It's def the sauce that makes that dish.  I personally love jalapenos and got an order of them - big mistake. . .  they were sour and tasted weird.  However, I still like this place a lot because the food is good, it's fairly cheap, they're open late, and they have friendly service!Went back for the first time since "Mr.  Boustan" sold the place a few years ago.  The chicken shawarmas are still delicious, but the service took a hit.  It's still arguably the best place to grab a quick lunch around Concordia or an early morning snack after a night of drinking on Crescent Street. Chicken shwarma sandwich yes.  I could have it every day of the week.  Lunch dinner. .  I love how they grill the pita and it gets crispy. The place is small and ALWAYS crowded . .  they must be doing something right ;)TheyVe got really good food! I always get the vegetarian plate.  It's delicious!!! I like the fact that it's open till 5am every night lol . .  They can even feed crazy people at that time !! They're the best middle eastern resto by far in montreal!!This hole in the wall is absolutely so good! The food is very comforting and affordable.  The falafel wrap is crispy and flavorful.  Theres a good crunch and the wrap is grilled to perfection.  Their chicken wrap is even better! The chicken is tender and seasoned very well.  This is a great lunch and late night spot.  I recommend this place to anyone craving Lebanese food or a quick and cheap bite!Not at all like the old Boustan! Service was terrible.  Food passable.  I ended up walking out.  There still remain a few good options in Montreal, but they are getting hard to find. I went to this place with a bunch of my friends after a long night of bachelorette celebrating.  After all the years of going to Concordia, I can't believe I haven't been to this place before.  I had a simple beef sandwich/ Shawarma /wrap thing and it was fantastic! I have no idea when this place closes or if it does because I think we were there quite late/ early in the morning.  The line went right out the door it was so popular, but the people there are super efficient and the line moved quite quickly.  They have pictures of famous people who have visited posted on the walls to give you something to look at while waiting which also makes it seem less long.  This place is awesome for a late night snack and definitely makes your morning much much more pleasant after a night of drinking.  ;)I LOVE the Shawarma here. . . . I LOVE IT.  We came here for lunch first--already a line.  The owners are a bit impatient when it comes to slow customers who like to take their time looking through the menu.  It's a fairly small shop, but there's plenty of seating inside.  This was our third meal here in Montreal, and it was amazing though. So amazing that we decided for our final meal at Montreal would be Boustan.  SO, we ordered about 5 shawarma's to be delivered to our apartment that night so that we would have nomnoms waiting for us after a night at New City Gas. 4 star only because delivery took forever. . . we were told they would be at our apartment in 20 minutes, but was instead delivered about an hour later.  We even called Boustan to confirm that they didn't get lost or forgot our order.  :( Anyways, still loved the Shawarma. . . but probably wouldn't go for delivery again! Hahah. Went around lunchtime and had a great meal!  The guys behind the counter are quick and know what they are doing. After eating out at expensive restaurants for the past 5 days in Montréal, we were in search for something more casual.  We stumbled upon this place and decided to give it a shot.  When it comes to the decor and cleanliness, it may be a bit questionable, since this place doesn't aim to impress but rather just feed those who want a fast or late night hungover meal.  You have to place your oder at the counter like every other shawarma place, but the man taking my order reminded me of the 'soup nazi' form Seinfeld.  He asked for your order and assembled the food in a very strict and uniform manner with no intention to smile.  Let's just say that all the negatives were forgotten once I tasted my food.  It actually beat every other over-priced meal I had throughout my week at Montréal! The shawarma was warm, hearty, and simply amazing. My mum got the falafel plate, and I have never seen a falafel plate with so much variety.  They had potatoes, rice, pita, salads, taboulli, and so much more all in one plate. We also got the grape vines (dolmaldes), which were great too. For an affordable meal that will satisfy any craving, and right by all the lively clubs, restaurants and shopping, this place is a must-go for sure!If I'm craving shish taouk , I head over to Boustan. The trio is the perfect amount of food!The sandwich is always meaty, served hot and freaking delicious. The potatoes are salty and perfect served smothered in garlic sauce. The third part of the trio is the drink.   If you are drunk sober, kinda hungry, or really hungry, Boustan is never a disappointing choice on Crescent!Line was long going in but it was fast.  Had kefta and chicken kabob.  Was best kefta I've had and you really can't screw up chicken.  Hummus was good too.  Garlic sauce was yuk but that's a personal thing.  Basically good food cheap and a lot of it!Had the trio (drink + potatoes + schwarma sandwich).  Delicious, quick and affordable in downtown Montreal.  I would definitely return.  They take credits cards (+extra points!). BOUSTAN!!! If you ever mention this name to anyone from Montreal, they will have a smile on their place.  The reason is this is the holy grail and go to place after a long night of partying.  Hits the spot every time!Super cheap and affordable.  Expect a line up especially at 2-3 am! I always get the combo plate.  It is just so fulfilling to stuff yourself with potatoes dripping of garlic and eating slices of well seasoned beef and chicken.  Both choices of meat are extremely moist and tender.  The portions are very generous and the service is great! All for under $10 as well!SECRET/HIDDEN MENU:I don't know if many people know about this. . .  but now that I am no longer in Montreal, I shall share with all of you a secret item that I found out from one of my best friends about this place.  It is called "The Creation!" Order it and thank me later.  I will keep it a surprise for you to find out!This place is like a cherry on an ice cream - best and sweetest way to end the night.  I will guarantee you that you will sleep like a baby after a long night out! Highly recommended!Lining up for Boustan's heavenly shwarma, garlic fries and friendly banter is a rite of passage for many students attending university in Montreal.  On a recent trip, I re-lived that experience and I enjoyed it as much (if not more) as I used to in the past.  The only thing that made the experience better this time was that I did not have finals/assignments etc to worry about!The shwarma was as good as I remember it being: toasty pita, with succulent crispy chicken choc-a-bloc with flavor and veggies, hummus and garlic sauce.   The accompanying garlic potatoes were gooey without being soggy and very filling.  Did I mention I am a big fan of the garlic sauce?The staffs' spirits and smiles are unfailing. As I was returning with my order, I walked passed a very drunk trio, once of whom was urinating quite proudly while standing in the middle of Crescent street.  Some things never change!Good Lebanese food and it's conveniently located on party street (crescent street) Montreal after you're done clubbing /partying. The food here is really good and the service is fast.  This is the only place I go when I'm in the mood for any Middle Eastern food really.

I understand the difficulty and need to keep up with production.  The meat was still tasty.  Overall, a very good Middle Eastern / shawarma option in the area. Ordered delivery.  As always, the price is right and the pitas are tasty.  I love that they toast them.  One issue w delivery: the pitas get a little soggy.  Not their fault. . .  it's a drawback of the limits of delivery technology.  They're always perfect when I pick them up at the store and they're fresh ;-)Their fixings and other dishes are nice as well.  I particularly like their vegetarian couscous and their kibbeh. One thing I like about their delivery setup: they keep a record of your account and what you've ordered.  Since I always get the same stuff, I can simply say: give me the usual.  Super easy and quick!This place was just down the street from where we were staying and was fairly busy every time we walked by.  It's located on Crescent street by where all the bars are and I think it's smart of them to open until 4AM to get all the drunkies. I tried the chicken shawarma warp and garlic potatoes.  They're pretty fast and taking your order and making the food so it's a good place to grab a bite and go.  It's a tiny place with like 5-10 tables so it's really not a sit down place. . . The wrap was delicious and the chicken wasn't dry! The garlic potatoes are DELICIOUS!!! It's def the sauce that makes that dish.  I personally love jalapenos and got an order of them - big mistake. . .  they were sour and tasted weird.  However, I still like this place a lot because the food is good, it's fairly cheap, they're open late, and they have friendly service!Went back for the first time since "Mr.  Boustan" sold the place a few years ago.  The chicken shawarmas are still delicious, but the service took a hit.  It's still arguably the best place to grab a quick lunch around Concordia or an early morning snack after a night of drinking on Crescent Street. Chicken shwarma sandwich yes.  I could have it every day of the week.  Lunch dinner. .  I love how they grill the pita and it gets crispy. The place is small and ALWAYS crowded . .  they must be doing something right ;)TheyVe got really good food! I always get the vegetarian plate.  It's delicious!!! I like the fact that it's open till 5am every night lol . .  They can even feed crazy people at that time !! They're the best middle eastern resto by far in montreal!!This hole in the wall is absolutely so good! The food is very comforting and affordable.  The falafel wrap is crispy and flavorful.  Theres a good crunch and the wrap is grilled to perfection.  Their chicken wrap is even better! The chicken is tender and seasoned very well.  This is a great lunch and late night spot.  I recommend this place to anyone craving Lebanese food or a quick and cheap bite!Not at all like the old Boustan! Service was terrible.  Food passable.  I ended up walking out.  There still remain a few good options in Montreal, but they are getting hard to find. I went to this place with a bunch of my friends after a long night of bachelorette celebrating.  After all the years of going to Concordia, I can't believe I haven't been to this place before.  I had a simple beef sandwich/ Shawarma /wrap thing and it was fantastic! I have no idea when this place closes or if it does because I think we were there quite late/ early in the morning.  The line went right out the door it was so popular, but the people there are super efficient and the line moved quite quickly.  They have pictures of famous people who have visited posted on the walls to give you something to look at while waiting which also makes it seem less long.  This place is awesome for a late night snack and definitely makes your morning much much more pleasant after a night of drinking.  ;)I LOVE the Shawarma here. . . . I LOVE IT.  We came here for lunch first--already a line.  The owners are a bit impatient when it comes to slow customers who like to take their time looking through the menu.  It's a fairly small shop, but there's plenty of seating inside.  This was our third meal here in Montreal, and it was amazing though. So amazing that we decided for our final meal at Montreal would be Boustan.  SO, we ordered about 5 shawarma's to be delivered to our apartment that night so that we would have nomnoms waiting for us after a night at New City Gas. 4 star only because delivery took forever. . . we were told they would be at our apartment in 20 minutes, but was instead delivered about an hour later.  We even called Boustan to confirm that they didn't get lost or forgot our order.  :( Anyways, still loved the Shawarma. . . but probably wouldn't go for delivery again! Hahah. Went around lunchtime and had a great meal!  The guys behind the counter are quick and know what they are doing. After eating out at expensive restaurants for the past 5 days in Montréal, we were in search for something more casual.  We stumbled upon this place and decided to give it a shot.  When it comes to the decor and cleanliness, it may be a bit questionable, since this place doesn't aim to impress but rather just feed those who want a fast or late night hungover meal.  You have to place your oder at the counter like every other shawarma place, but the man taking my order reminded me of the 'soup nazi' form Seinfeld.  He asked for your order and assembled the food in a very strict and uniform manner with no intention to smile.  Let's just say that all the negatives were forgotten once I tasted my food.  It actually beat every other over-priced meal I had throughout my week at Montréal! The shawarma was warm, hearty, and simply amazing. My mum got the falafel plate, and I have never seen a falafel plate with so much variety.  They had potatoes, rice, pita, salads, taboulli, and so much more all in one plate. We also got the grape vines (dolmaldes), which were great too. For an affordable meal that will satisfy any craving, and right by all the lively clubs, restaurants and shopping, this place is a must-go for sure!If I'm craving shish taouk , I head over to Boustan. The trio is the perfect amount of food!The sandwich is always meaty, served hot and freaking delicious. The potatoes are salty and perfect served smothered in garlic sauce. The third part of the trio is the drink.   If you are drunk sober, kinda hungry, or really hungry, Boustan is never a disappointing choice on Crescent!Line was long going in but it was fast.  Had kefta and chicken kabob.  Was best kefta I've had and you really can't screw up chicken.  Hummus was good too.  Garlic sauce was yuk but that's a personal thing.  Basically good food cheap and a lot of it!Had the trio (drink + potatoes + schwarma sandwich).  Delicious, quick and affordable in downtown Montreal.  I would definitely return.  They take credits cards (+extra points!). BOUSTAN!!! If you ever mention this name to anyone from Montreal, they will have a smile on their place.  The reason is this is the holy grail and go to place after a long night of partying.  Hits the spot every time!Super cheap and affordable.  Expect a line up especially at 2-3 am! I always get the combo plate.  It is just so fulfilling to stuff yourself with potatoes dripping of garlic and eating slices of well seasoned beef and chicken.  Both choices of meat are extremely moist and tender.  The portions are very generous and the service is great! All for under $10 as well!SECRET/HIDDEN MENU:I don't know if many people know about this. . .  but now that I am no longer in Montreal, I shall share with all of you a secret item that I found out from one of my best friends about this place.  It is called "The Creation!" Order it and thank me later.  I will keep it a surprise for you to find out!This place is like a cherry on an ice cream - best and sweetest way to end the night.  I will guarantee you that you will sleep like a baby after a long night out! Highly recommended!Lining up for Boustan's heavenly shwarma, garlic fries and friendly banter is a rite of passage for many students attending university in Montreal.  On a recent trip, I re-lived that experience and I enjoyed it as much (if not more) as I used to in the past.  The only thing that made the experience better this time was that I did not have finals/assignments etc to worry about!The shwarma was as good as I remember it being: toasty pita, with succulent crispy chicken choc-a-bloc with flavor and veggies, hummus and garlic sauce.   The accompanying garlic potatoes were gooey without being soggy and very filling.  Did I mention I am a big fan of the garlic sauce?The staffs' spirits and smiles are unfailing. As I was returning with my order, I walked passed a very drunk trio, once of whom was urinating quite proudly while standing in the middle of Crescent street.  Some things never change!Good Lebanese food and it's conveniently located on party street (crescent street) Montreal after you're done clubbing /partying. The food here is really good and the service is fast.  This is the only place I go when I'm in the mood for any Middle Eastern food really.  I love the chicken shawarma pita, that's the only thing I get there. Well known for their shawarma sandwiches, and for good reason! They're super cheap (less than $5 a pop) and they're delicious.  I had both the chicken and the beef with the works, and it was exactly what you want before a nigh of heavy drinking and bar/club hopping. They have outdoor seating as well as indoor seating with a TV in the actual restaurant.  It takes a little bit of time to get your order, but that's because they make it all fresh.  I liked the chicken more than the beef, but both had their merits. Great pit stop in between bars on Crescent. Ate here for lunch after visiting the nearby art museum.  Delicious.  Messy.  Busy, but efficient.   I had to wait out a table, but it was a good overall experience.  Pretty sure my kids would not like it, but young adults and business folk are lucky to have this place!I grabbed a quick lunch at Bouston yesterday, right before heading to the airport.  It was my last meal in Montreal and it did not disappoint. It's conveniently located on Crescent Street within stumbling distance from the bars and also within walking distance from our Sheraton hotel.
