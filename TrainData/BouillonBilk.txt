Absolutely excellent.  I started with the New Orleans and negroni Blanc cocktails and both ere outstanding.  Then we moved onto the starters of himachi and the beet salad were both perfectly blended in terms of contrasting flavours.  T he scallops and the venison were both outstanding, it was hard to decide which was better.  The pumpkin cake dessert was also a highlight.  $230 for two people including tip!Our lunch at Bouillon Bilk is in a heated battle with our subsequent dinner at Liverpool House for best meal in Montreal.  Since I was soberer for the former, Bouillon Bilk gets a wink and a gun as the de facto winner.  Our larger party mostly hadn't arrived in Montreal yet, and as such, we took the opportunity to squeeze in a fancy pants lunch at nearby Bouillon Bilk. We arrived right as it opened, sans reservations, and were lucky to be seated.  Within 15 minutes, the dining room was packed with patrons on a Friday morning.  So I think we made a good choice. The menu, officially described as Canadian (New), was overtly French-influenced and not unlike the multitude of good "American (New)" places you find in major cities like Chicago or San Francisco.  Separating the wheat from the chaff is often difficult, but in Boullion Bilk's case, I feel comfortable designating it the former. Despite the weekend of indulgences awaiting us, we still went overboard with the lunch.  For starters, we went Kayne-style ham, getting oysters, foie, and tartare (tuna or hamachi, can't remember which).  All just fantastic, but at a French-inspired place, the foie better be a cut above, and it was. For mains, I had a hard time deciding between the octopus and the duck confit, two personal French favorites that are well worth the coin when cooked well.  I opted for the former while my compadre did the latter.  Again, both dishes were wholly excellent.  Overall, lunch at Bouillon Bilk was a great starter kit to a fun weekend. - BOTTOM LINE:By far the BEST BEST meal we had in Montreal (and this included Au Pied de Cochon). . . perhaps the best meal I've had in a few years.  Make reservations in advance.  The walk to Bouillon Bilk was not far from downtown and also close to a ton of great bars for post-dinner nightcaps. - THE SERVICE:We stumbled into Bouillon Bilk reservation-less and the French skills of an infant.  The hostess told us the wait would be two hours and we were disappointed but definitely not surprised.  Then, she smiled and said what the heck, and managed to squeeze us 4 in right then and there in a fantastic corner table.  THANK YOU for giving us the gift of this meal! I do not know your name, but you had a really cute blue shirt with artichokes on it.  The rest of the staff was awesome as well.  The menu was clearly explained to us and our cups remained happily filled with cocktails and water throughout the meal. - THE SPACE:Intimate but unpretentious.  Great for parents, dates, and old friends. - THE FOOD:Amazing.  Spectacular.  Our fois gras on toast, strawberries, and beets hit every note of texture and flavor imaginable.  Us four shared this appetizer and were all able to get ample bites of the fois gras.  The fruit and beets provided a refreshing break from the heaviness of the fois gras. I had the special of the day - veal 3 ways (veal cutlet, veal sweetbreads, and veal pastrami) and it was phenomenal.  What an experience.  The cutlet was perfectly cooked and medium rare, the sweetbreads crispy and juicy, and the pastrami perfectly salty and fatty.  I really appreciated how much they try to push the envelope but still keep their flavors true and homey.  My boyfriends sea bass had the crispiest skin ever.  I aspire to cook fish that well. Overall, an amazing experience at this place.  I'm so glad we managed to squeeze in here without a reservation. . . but I suggest you make one in advance! It was by the most memorable food experience we had in Montreal. This restaurant became, immediately, my new favorite restaurant in all of Montreal.  As a frequent visitor of the beautiful city, it wasn't until my most recent trip that I decided to give this place a visit.  The food here is absolute perfection.  Everyone at the table raved about the food.  Everything is prepared perfectly from presentation to taste to texture.  This place defines culinary execution.  I ordered the halibut and it tasted as if it were caught that day.   The cooking temperature ensured that the freshness of the fish hit me upon my first bite, at which time the flesh melts softly on the palate giving way to the sweet scent of the ocean.  That same consistency carries through the meal from the first bite to the last.  The perfect execution even carries to the vegetables and fingerling potatoes.  A million kudos the the chef.  The sommelier was able to offer the perfect selection to pair with our dishes.  All in all this made for the perfect dining experience. Before this meal, my favorite all time meal had been at Charlie Trotter's in Chicago.  That meal is now tied with the one I had at Bouillon Bilk.   Very interesting menu, creative flavor and texture combinations, amazing execution, beautiful presentation, and spectacular service.  The beet salad is transformative.  I also loved the lobster amuse-bouche, the scallops, the venison, the chocolate financier.  This is a very special dining experience.  Bravo!This was our favorite restaurant in Montreal. We arrived after hours of riding bikes.  We were casually dressed, sweaty, and covered in dust; however, the employees at Bouillon Bilk welcomed us just like the best dressed folks there.  We saw everybody at Bouillon Bilk.  There were beautifully dressed people in the restaurant as well as a casually dressed family. The restaurant itself is gorgeous.  The front windows let in lots of natural light.  The lines are straight and clean.  The elements were modern.  For example, the sink was outside of the bathroom and was long and communal.  It was really neat and surprising. And then the food.  M ordered the duck.  It was amazing.  She let me try some.  It was tender and melted in your mouth.  It melted and it mixed with the sauce and contrasted with the fresh greens.  It was a full song with harmony. I got the cucumber salad.  I love the freshness of cucumber and Bouillon Bilk took that characteristic and let it shine.  It was enhanced with a few radishes, some goat cheese and some crispy nuts.  It was crunchy, soft, and light. Next, we got three desserts: a cheese plate, strawberries, and chocolate.  Yum, yum, and YUM! When we first made our reservation, we were told that the table would need to be free by 8:00 PM.  As that time drew closer, and we were still enjoying our dessert, I asked our server.  He encouraged us to linger and submit to the pleasures before us. Our server also told us about our next favorite restaurant in Montreal: Hotel Herman.  We would have gone to Bouillon Bilk every evening if the menu was more extensive.  But that's some of the poetry of Bouillon Bilk.  It knows what it can do and it executes it will finesse. I love the name of this restaurant, WOO for alliteration.  Boullion Bilk - it's fun to say.  I find the name attractive as well as everything inside - environment and cuisine.  All appealing and cool and lovely.  The decor is extremely simple and clean.  Wooden floors, white walls, white tablecloths and napkins, big heavy wooden tables.  No crazy artwork or light fixtures, just simple textures and clean lines.  We started with the "Quebec Cheese Assortment" (5 cheeses for $20 or 3 for $15).  Of course we got 5, and they were each local and incredible.  I can't remember the exact names of each cheese, and I know they rotate depending on what's available, but they're five very different and beautiful options.  We ate every single bite, of course.  What's better than cheese?? I can't think of anything. For my entree, I ordered the scallop dish which comes with zucchini, shiitake mushrooms, pear, and watercress served in a brown butter.  Oh my stars, you guys.  These scallops were the most buttery, perfectly seared, velvety pieces of fish everrrr.  The brown butter was rich and fantastic and the pear provided a really interesting sweetness.  This particular dish was $31 which is a bit pricey considering the small portion.  It's enough food for one person surely, a healthy size, but I was craving a bit more in the end.  Wonderful wine menu here as well with some great local options. If you're in the mood for pretty plating and a business class type of atmosphere, Boullion Bilk is the perfect spot.  Service was down-to-earth and friendly, and despite my last minute booking we were able to nab a table for 3 on a Friday night.   Granted, we were only given a 10-minute window to actually get to the restaurant, but as we lived nearby anyway it wasn't too much of an issue.  With the goal to stuff myself silly with foie gras over the weekend, I started the meal with a foie gras appetizer.  A generous slab of deliciously seared foie, sitting on top of a slice of toasted brioche and prettily dotted by pureed raspberries and a beet reduction.  Apart from their regular menu were also a few daily special additions for the night (of which I unfortunately can't remember), but the scallops entree had caught my eye already anyway.   3 scallops in drool-inducing browned butter, the portion is a tad scanty but it makes me hungry just reminiscing about it.   My scallops were a tad bit overcooked - though far from the dreaded rubbery state, my inner bratty food snob says it could've used a literal *touch* less heat to retain more umami mouthfeel.   Hey, I did admit that it's quite bratty of me to point out such a minor detail - cause it was otherwise delicious.  The dessert, a rhubarb, strawberries and juniper dish with lime gremolata and little islands of buttermilk cream seemed to float in a translucent pinkish red pool, which turned out to be a very thin layer of set rhubarb gel.   Lovely dishes and all-around lovely place. There is a reason Buillon Bilk was named one of the restaurants to try in Montreal before you die.  This place is fabulous.  At first, the restaurant's exterior and interior decor is very plain.  You wouldn't expect this place to have it all.  But I came here not for the decor.  I came for the vibrant and decorative menu as well as the nightly specials.  Each dish from appetizers to dessert was thoroughly planned out with complimenting ingredients, bold colors and overwhelming flavors.  Calling the items I enjoyed fantastic was not enough.  I came here already full from the day's endless eating but had to make an attempt to sit down at Buillon Bilk on my last night in Montreal to try something.  I had the lobster appetizer and sea urchin linguini.  Both appetizers were drop dead fabulous! I can't imagine how numbing everything else on the menu could be.  I'm at a lost for words.  I could die happy.  Note to self: Come back to Montreal for more Buillon Bilk. This meal is right there with the best meals I've ever had.  The restaurant itself is small and trendy, and the hosts and waitstaff all very polite and knowledgable.  While the ambiance of the space and the attentiveness of our waiter definitely contributed to the experience, the real star of the night was the food. We started with cocktails and appetizers; the hamachi, and the sweetbreads with veal tongue.  The hamachi was served raw, and was paired with yuzu kosho, grapefruit, fennel, and cucumber.  Delicious, clean, and light.  The sweetbreads may have been the single best thing I had all night, and both they and the tongue were melt in your mouth tender.  For our entrees we had duck three ways (dumpling, breast, and heart), and halibut two ways (filet, and fried cheek).  All three variations of the duck were amazing.  The heart was meaty and tasty without being gamey, the breast was tender and paired perfectly with the cara cara orange, and the dumpling was good enough to be a dish of its own.  The fish was just as good, especially the cheek, which flaked apart as soon as the fork hit it.  We ended our meal with a pistachio financier served with black current, white chocolate, and basil.  Just sweet enough, and the perfect ending to a great meal.  The courteousness of the staff, the beautiful plating, and most importantly the flavor of the food make Bouillon Bilk a must try. This is a beautiful take on modern gourmet Canadian/North-American cuisine.  The restaurant itself is bare-walled and plain, and it's very a loud yet somehow intimate setting.  The waitstaff was a bit cold, but they were generally helpful with any questions we had with the menu. My friend ordered the rabbit and ravioli, and I ordered the halibut two ways (fried and sous-vide).  The portions here appear small, but they aren't ludicrously small.  After the bread and my entree, I was satisfied.  The halibut was excellent fried and even better sous-vide; I'd never had sous-vide before, but it was incredibly tender and moist. After the meal, we ordered the yogurt & mango & papaya dessert, and it was excellent.  Seriously the most creative and delicious dessert I've ever had.  Each component of the dessert blended together beautifully while being distinct flavors.  The contrast of texture was something that I've never seen executed so masterfully in a dessert.  You must order this dessert!Boy was our dinner at Buoillon Bilk the best meal we had in Montreal, maybe even one of the best dinners I've had, period!  We tried making a reservation the night before our actual dinner but it was completely booked.  Now I understand why!Firstly, the restaurant is beautiful, despite the confusing, yellow awning it stands under.   The interior is outrageously chic with plentiful seating and a cool bar area, where we dined.   Secondly, the staff is super friendly, in an unpretentious way.   Moreover, the food was AWESOME!  We ordered a dozen oysters to start with and to get our libidos going.   They were a mouthful, fresh and came with 3 sauces that one can do with or without.   For our entrees, we ordered the cod fish and scallops, both of which were gorgeously plated and delicious!!  My cod fish was so moist that it collapsed upon the stab of my fork (t'was a gentle stab).   The garnishments on the plate also paired very well with the fish.   The scallops were also perfectly seared with garnishments that complimented the shellfish very well.   We devoured every single last bit of our artistic entrees AND ordered the upside down peach cake with ice cream for dessert, which left us leaving the restaurant with nothing but satisfaction!Thank you Buoillon Bilk for a memorable meal that made our trip to Montreal that much more amazing!Great restaurant overall. Every single dish was impressive, rich and full of different flavors in great harmony. Service is outstanding, all simple details were just right. Loved everything.  We enjoyed a lovely evening. For our 1 year, my husband took me to a really fancy french restaurant called Bouillon Bilk , it took roughly 30 mins to walk there - this restaurant is located at a very sketch place.  There were construction everywhere and homeless tents were close to the area. . .  I seriously wonder why they decided to open a restaurant in this area?The food was superb though, the service is also fantastic.  The server pretty much memorized the menu, he told me about the special they were having $5 for 3 shrimps.  So I said why not! I should had known. . . . . .  tiny tiny tiny shrimps.  Picture below.  Well, I guess I kinda got 3 and a 1/2 shrimp.  He was being very generous.   I got the pasta.  Oh - it was delicious! I tried so so so hard to not just eat it all in one bite.  So I took little bites so my meal would last longer.  I am not meant to eat at a french cuisine. My husband had the short ribs Equally as good. The portion is wayyyyyyy too small for me.  I would have to order 5 plates to fill me up!Bouillon Bilk (BB) is one of the few places in Montreal that all my chef friends consistently recommend.  They pay attention to what these folks are doing.  I've been here for lunch or dinner well over 30 times the last few years (I often take work-related visitors for dinner here) and have never been disappointed.  Menu changes occur sufficiently often that it makes little sense to give details about the specific dishes I tried this time.  While some restaurants tend to be better at delivering certain types of dishes, I feel that BB is consistent - I don't remember ever having a dish that I didn't like and the highlights over time cannot be classified as a specific type. BB is also a very stylish spot and the service staff are helpful and extremely pleasant. This is one of my favorite food destinations in Montreal.  To reiterate: of my favorites, it is also the most consistent at delivering a solid dining experience. My muse was probably watching over, since it placed me within walking distance of Bouillon Bilk. . . Simple urban design, endless bar seating, low ceilings and dimmed lights set my mood right from the start. It's packed.  Always packed.  So do make reservations.  However - if you alone or do not mind eating at the bar, you can still score seat there. I asked sazerac as soon as I saw it on the list, but alas, it was not available that night, and my server (who was very helpful and nice, btw), recommended another drink of similar composition (name escapes me at the moment), which was incredibly well made. It's all started with perfect drink. . .  Followed by bread and butter. . .  Then, beautifully presented sweetbreads, veal tongue & celery root appetizer arrived.  My eyes lit up, and my taste buds started singing.  It was delicious.  But it was not over yet - my cleaned to the original shine plate disappeared magically, and in it place came main course - perfectly seared scallops, cauliflower, shiitake mushrooms & watercress.  I closed my eyes in joy and savored it piece by piece. . .  I was not planning on dessert (ok, that's a bold fat lie if you know me.  shhhh!), but I could not resist special that day - chocolate macaron, a scoop of ice cream & little cup of warmed wine, all together complimenting each other in taste pairing and in presentation. It was an amazing meal all together. For me, the class of Bouillon Bilk stands up there with Envy and Juni - with service, food and presentation being on the level that put it on the list of my forever favorites. FINALLY made it to Bouillon Bilk! It's been on my list for a very, very long time and the hype was definitely worth it.   First off, a 5:30pm reservation is definitely where it's at.  The restaurant opens exactly at 5:30 and you will be one of the first tables seated.  Within minutes, the rest of the place will be packed with all the other smart cookies who had the same plan as you.  That way you don't have to deal with too much of a backlog in the kitchen as you would if you were the second seating in the evening.  You even get the added bonus of dealing with extra-friendly staff at the beginning of service. In terms of decor, the crisp white tablecloths and the sparkling wine glasses are the first things you notice when you walk in the door.  In the middle of the dining room, the wooden bartop is attention-grabbing (Note to self: Ask to sit at the bar next time. . .  Just gorgeous!).  For service, the staff is VERY attentive and as another reviewer pointed out, they are absolute experts on the menu.  The waitress and chef were very accommodating for the dairy and nut allergies at our table.  Now, onto the foooooood: Lamb tartar - This was my first time trying lamb tartar and now I'm a big fan.  The combination of the smoky cabbage, crispy topping and some sort of stonefruit all on top of the lamb was just unreal.  Beef duo - Special of the night.  Grilled strip loin ("Melt-in-your-mouth") with braised beef cheeks (Super tender), veggies, mushroom and gnochhi (Original dish has butter, parmesan and sweet potato puree as well). Lobster cappelleti - Rich and indulgent, in the best way possible.  The mascarpone and cream filling was soooo savoury and satisfying.  Big chunks of lobster on top.  Crispy fried bits and some plainer green veggies on the side. . .  I was literally tasting perfection.  Chocolate ganache - With sour cream ice cream and lemon cream.  I was warned by previous reviews that dessert is not Bouillon Bilk's strong point.  I agree that it was average but there is nothing bad about the standard chocolate ganache.  To explain my four-star rating. . .  We both agreed (like other reviewers) that a five-star rating would be granted with slightly larger portion sizes.  Even after having three full courses, we were not that full.  Yes, the flavours, service and decor are top notch but just a little bit more food on their plates would be ideal!Very chic farm to table restaurant in Montreal has all the elements of a great restaurant.   Wine list was quite good with some reasonably priced gems.   Service was great and very attentive to all our requests (in English of course).   The highlights of the meal included the Hamachi appetizer, duck Margaret (two types of ducks) perfectly cooked, and the exceptional scallops.   If I lived here I would definitely go back!I really enjoyed my time here.  I loved the food.  Overall I would give it a 4. 5/5. We dropped in for our 8pm reservation.  The place was busy, there was a constant flow of people coming and going.  The host had this really awesome flower jacket, he was friendly and quick to offer to take our coats. Decor: Felt modern and elegant, with the white walls, which did make the place seem bigger.  However, there wasn't a lot of space between some of the tables.  Especially the single tables.  Would have liked just a bit more room to navigate.  They had a mix of different tables.  Higher wooden tables by the bar, and the shorter tables, with white table clothes in the main dining area.  Also some tables with booths. Service 3. 5/5There was a long wait between some of our appetizers and our main meal.  We didn't leave the restaurant until 2. 5 hours later.  They did forgot about 1 of our appetizers, so it was slow in coming out.  And then the main meal took a bit longer to come out.  Since there was a bigger group that put their order in before us.  They did apologize for the longer wait time, which was nice. Our server was great at describing every dish.  She was also very knowledgeable about the ingredients and the different wines that would pair well with our meal.  She was friendly and checked to make sure we had what we needed. Food 4. 5/5 Each and every dish was presented beautifully.  Truly works of art. Appetizer - Every appetizer we ordered was delicious. The sweetbreads were delicious and fried nice and soft.  This was my first time trying it and I really enjoyed it.  The veal tongue melted in your mouth.  It was soft and not chewy.  I loved the pear toffee reduction.  The toffee was unexpected, but add a nice sweet caramel taste.  The pear and toffee paired nicely with the sweetbreads and the tongue.  We order the special scallop amuse bouche twice because my boyfriend like it so much.  The scallops came with clementine and parsnip.  Scallops were fresh and succulent.  The sweetness of the scallops, were brought out by the clementine and lime juice.  The special appetizer of sashimi fluke was my favourite dish of the night.  I definitely had a wow moment after eating the dish.  It was that good.  This was accompanied by beets and plums.  That were sweet and delicious.  Fried capers were a lovely crunchy treat that added a crunchy texture to the dish.  Very pretty to look at.  MainVenison with hedgehog mushrooms.  Venison was very tender and delicious cooked perfectly.  The meat melted in your mouth.  The venison didn't have a gamey taste to it at all.  The inside was still pink and juicy.  This was served on a bed of quinoa with chestnuts and greens.   The chocolate coffee sauce brought the whole dish together.  I usually dislike chocolate in savoury dishes, but here the chocolate was light and not over powering.  My boyfriend ordered the sirloin steak with hedgehog mushrooms, snails and onions.  Steak was soft and pink in the centre.  You could truly taste the beef flavour coming through.  This was a good dish, but it was my least favourite dish of the night. We ordered the pear molasses cake with pear ginger, parsnip ice cream, to share.  I was truly blown away by the parsnip ice cream.  Who would think that this would make a nice ice cream flavour? It was really delicious and you could definitely taste the parsnip.  It was a nice way to finish the meal with something sweet but not overly sweet, which I find a lot of dessert can be.  It also wasn't too heavy, which was great especially after all the other food we ate. I would definitely come back to try their other dishes if I was in Montreal again. Found this restaurant on Eater's list of must eat restaurants in Montreal.  The restaurant is small w/ fine lines, white linen tables, and has a modern feel to it.  Street parking only.  The restaurant is a little tricky to find since there is no sign in front of the building itself, just the name on a semi hidden front entrance.  We totally missed the restaurant & walked 2 blocks too far until we realized we passed 1595.  Staff and service are both friendly.  There are 4 separate restrooms with a public sink area.  I definitely called the restaurant to make a reservation based on another yelper's recommendation.  Eating early definitely has its benefits.  We set the rsvp at 5:30 and sure enough the restaurant was packed by 6:30-7pm on a Monday evening.  For appetizers, we ordered:Cured mackerel w celery, green chickpeas, mint & rhubarb gelee (Amuse bouche of the day) - I didn't eat this dish bc I'm pregnant and it's "raw".  Hubby was thoroughly impressed & raved about this dish.  Steamed jumbo oyster w/ radish, pears & ginger fermented black bean broth (special of the day) - this oyster was packed a flavorful punch.  Everything worked so well together and the broth was magnificent. Pork shoulder tagliatelle - this dish was good, but we could of done without it.  Pasta was cooked perfectly and pork was tender.  The sour cream added a slight hint of "cheesy" tang that I didn't care for. Sweetbreads w/ veal tongue, celery root, shishito peppers & pineapple - WOW! This dish was amazing.  The sweetbreads were perfectly cooked & crispy, the veal tongue was tender & full of flavor, the celery root purée was silky smooth, the thinly shaved celery root was pickled just right and the char on the shishito peppers added a nice smokiness to the dish.  The little bits of caramelized pineapple added a nice amount of sweetness. For our entrees, we ordered: Halibut two ways w/ a broccoli purée & florets, shiitake mushrooms, potatoes, Muscat grapes & hazelnuts - the crispy halibut nugget was the best element of this dish.  The main halibut itself was delicate and tender, but had a slight fishy taste to it.  Not sure how fresh the quality of the fish was.   The grapes and onions added a little bit too much sweetness to the dish.  The shiitake mushrooms were bland and the broccoli florets were a little over cooked.  This dish was crying for acidity and a squeeze of lemon definitely helped.  Quail w/ quail egg, fava beans, potato, & parsnips (special of the evening) - OMG this dish was divine! Perfectly seasoned & cooked quail.  The quail was slightly crisp and the sauce that came w it was smooth and rich.  All of the elements were superb.  Overall, we would totally return to this restaurant bc everything was executed well and the flavor profiles of each dish was exceptional (except for minor issues w/ the tagliatelle and halibut).  The only thing I didn't like about this restaurant was the inflexibility of the chef/cooks not wanting to cook any proteins above medium rare.  For someone who is pregnant and careful with how her food is prepared, I would have appreciated it if the chef/cook was willing to cook the protein to at least medium/medium well so that there's less of a potential illness or harm to my unborn child.  For that reason, I had to go with the halibut dish which I wasn't that impressed with.  I definitely recommend this restaurant.  Some yelpers commented on how small the portions are, but if the server times out each course right, the dishes are actually filling.  If not, fill up on their complimentary bread and butter!Absolutely excellent.  I started with the New Orleans and negroni Blanc cocktails and both ere outstanding.  Then we moved onto the starters of himachi and the beet salad were both perfectly blended in terms of contrasting flavours.  T he scallops and the venison were both outstanding, it was hard to decide which was better.  The pumpkin cake dessert was also a highlight.  $230 for two people including tip!Our lunch at Bouillon Bilk is in a heated battle with our subsequent dinner at Liverpool House for best meal in Montreal.

The lines are straight and clean.  The elements were modern.  For example, the sink was outside of the bathroom and was long and communal.  It was really neat and surprising. And then the food.  M ordered the duck.  It was amazing.  She let me try some.  It was tender and melted in your mouth.  It melted and it mixed with the sauce and contrasted with the fresh greens.  It was a full song with harmony. I got the cucumber salad.  I love the freshness of cucumber and Bouillon Bilk took that characteristic and let it shine.  It was enhanced with a few radishes, some goat cheese and some crispy nuts.  It was crunchy, soft, and light. Next, we got three desserts: a cheese plate, strawberries, and chocolate.  Yum, yum, and YUM! When we first made our reservation, we were told that the table would need to be free by 8:00 PM.  As that time drew closer, and we were still enjoying our dessert, I asked our server.  He encouraged us to linger and submit to the pleasures before us. Our server also told us about our next favorite restaurant in Montreal: Hotel Herman.  We would have gone to Bouillon Bilk every evening if the menu was more extensive.  But that's some of the poetry of Bouillon Bilk.  It knows what it can do and it executes it will finesse. I love the name of this restaurant, WOO for alliteration.  Boullion Bilk - it's fun to say.  I find the name attractive as well as everything inside - environment and cuisine.  All appealing and cool and lovely.  The decor is extremely simple and clean.  Wooden floors, white walls, white tablecloths and napkins, big heavy wooden tables.  No crazy artwork or light fixtures, just simple textures and clean lines.  We started with the "Quebec Cheese Assortment" (5 cheeses for $20 or 3 for $15).  Of course we got 5, and they were each local and incredible.  I can't remember the exact names of each cheese, and I know they rotate depending on what's available, but they're five very different and beautiful options.  We ate every single bite, of course.  What's better than cheese?? I can't think of anything. For my entree, I ordered the scallop dish which comes with zucchini, shiitake mushrooms, pear, and watercress served in a brown butter.  Oh my stars, you guys.  These scallops were the most buttery, perfectly seared, velvety pieces of fish everrrr.  The brown butter was rich and fantastic and the pear provided a really interesting sweetness.  This particular dish was $31 which is a bit pricey considering the small portion.  It's enough food for one person surely, a healthy size, but I was craving a bit more in the end.  Wonderful wine menu here as well with some great local options. If you're in the mood for pretty plating and a business class type of atmosphere, Boullion Bilk is the perfect spot.  Service was down-to-earth and friendly, and despite my last minute booking we were able to nab a table for 3 on a Friday night.   Granted, we were only given a 10-minute window to actually get to the restaurant, but as we lived nearby anyway it wasn't too much of an issue.  With the goal to stuff myself silly with foie gras over the weekend, I started the meal with a foie gras appetizer.  A generous slab of deliciously seared foie, sitting on top of a slice of toasted brioche and prettily dotted by pureed raspberries and a beet reduction.  Apart from their regular menu were also a few daily special additions for the night (of which I unfortunately can't remember), but the scallops entree had caught my eye already anyway.   3 scallops in drool-inducing browned butter, the portion is a tad scanty but it makes me hungry just reminiscing about it.   My scallops were a tad bit overcooked - though far from the dreaded rubbery state, my inner bratty food snob says it could've used a literal *touch* less heat to retain more umami mouthfeel.   Hey, I did admit that it's quite bratty of me to point out such a minor detail - cause it was otherwise delicious.  The dessert, a rhubarb, strawberries and juniper dish with lime gremolata and little islands of buttermilk cream seemed to float in a translucent pinkish red pool, which turned out to be a very thin layer of set rhubarb gel.   Lovely dishes and all-around lovely place. There is a reason Buillon Bilk was named one of the restaurants to try in Montreal before you die.  This place is fabulous.  At first, the restaurant's exterior and interior decor is very plain.  You wouldn't expect this place to have it all.  But I came here not for the decor.  I came for the vibrant and decorative menu as well as the nightly specials.  Each dish from appetizers to dessert was thoroughly planned out with complimenting ingredients, bold colors and overwhelming flavors.  Calling the items I enjoyed fantastic was not enough.  I came here already full from the day's endless eating but had to make an attempt to sit down at Buillon Bilk on my last night in Montreal to try something.  I had the lobster appetizer and sea urchin linguini.  Both appetizers were drop dead fabulous! I can't imagine how numbing everything else on the menu could be.  I'm at a lost for words.  I could die happy.  Note to self: Come back to Montreal for more Buillon Bilk. This meal is right there with the best meals I've ever had.  The restaurant itself is small and trendy, and the hosts and waitstaff all very polite and knowledgable.  While the ambiance of the space and the attentiveness of our waiter definitely contributed to the experience, the real star of the night was the food. We started with cocktails and appetizers; the hamachi, and the sweetbreads with veal tongue.  The hamachi was served raw, and was paired with yuzu kosho, grapefruit, fennel, and cucumber.  Delicious, clean, and light.  The sweetbreads may have been the single best thing I had all night, and both they and the tongue were melt in your mouth tender.  For our entrees we had duck three ways (dumpling, breast, and heart), and halibut two ways (filet, and fried cheek).  All three variations of the duck were amazing.  The heart was meaty and tasty without being gamey, the breast was tender and paired perfectly with the cara cara orange, and the dumpling was good enough to be a dish of its own.  The fish was just as good, especially the cheek, which flaked apart as soon as the fork hit it.  We ended our meal with a pistachio financier served with black current, white chocolate, and basil.  Just sweet enough, and the perfect ending to a great meal.  The courteousness of the staff, the beautiful plating, and most importantly the flavor of the food make Bouillon Bilk a must try. This is a beautiful take on modern gourmet Canadian/North-American cuisine.  The restaurant itself is bare-walled and plain, and it's very a loud yet somehow intimate setting.  The waitstaff was a bit cold, but they were generally helpful with any questions we had with the menu. My friend ordered the rabbit and ravioli, and I ordered the halibut two ways (fried and sous-vide).  The portions here appear small, but they aren't ludicrously small.  After the bread and my entree, I was satisfied.  The halibut was excellent fried and even better sous-vide; I'd never had sous-vide before, but it was incredibly tender and moist. After the meal, we ordered the yogurt & mango & papaya dessert, and it was excellent.  Seriously the most creative and delicious dessert I've ever had.  Each component of the dessert blended together beautifully while being distinct flavors.  The contrast of texture was something that I've never seen executed so masterfully in a dessert.  You must order this dessert!Boy was our dinner at Buoillon Bilk the best meal we had in Montreal, maybe even one of the best dinners I've had, period!  We tried making a reservation the night before our actual dinner but it was completely booked.  Now I understand why!Firstly, the restaurant is beautiful, despite the confusing, yellow awning it stands under.   The interior is outrageously chic with plentiful seating and a cool bar area, where we dined.   Secondly, the staff is super friendly, in an unpretentious way.   Moreover, the food was AWESOME!  We ordered a dozen oysters to start with and to get our libidos going.   They were a mouthful, fresh and came with 3 sauces that one can do with or without.   For our entrees, we ordered the cod fish and scallops, both of which were gorgeously plated and delicious!!  My cod fish was so moist that it collapsed upon the stab of my fork (t'was a gentle stab).   The garnishments on the plate also paired very well with the fish.   The scallops were also perfectly seared with garnishments that complimented the shellfish very well.   We devoured every single last bit of our artistic entrees AND ordered the upside down peach cake with ice cream for dessert, which left us leaving the restaurant with nothing but satisfaction!Thank you Buoillon Bilk for a memorable meal that made our trip to Montreal that much more amazing!Great restaurant overall. Every single dish was impressive, rich and full of different flavors in great harmony. Service is outstanding, all simple details were just right. Loved everything.  We enjoyed a lovely evening. For our 1 year, my husband took me to a really fancy french restaurant called Bouillon Bilk , it took roughly 30 mins to walk there - this restaurant is located at a very sketch place.  There were construction everywhere and homeless tents were close to the area. . .  I seriously wonder why they decided to open a restaurant in this area?The food was superb though, the service is also fantastic.  The server pretty much memorized the menu, he told me about the special they were having $5 for 3 shrimps.  So I said why not! I should had known. . . . . .  tiny tiny tiny shrimps.  Picture below.  Well, I guess I kinda got 3 and a 1/2 shrimp.  He was being very generous.   I got the pasta.  Oh - it was delicious! I tried so so so hard to not just eat it all in one bite.  So I took little bites so my meal would last longer.  I am not meant to eat at a french cuisine. My husband had the short ribs Equally as good. The portion is wayyyyyyy too small for me.  I would have to order 5 plates to fill me up!Bouillon Bilk (BB) is one of the few places in Montreal that all my chef friends consistently recommend.  They pay attention to what these folks are doing.  I've been here for lunch or dinner well over 30 times the last few years (I often take work-related visitors for dinner here) and have never been disappointed.  Menu changes occur sufficiently often that it makes little sense to give details about the specific dishes I tried this time.  While some restaurants tend to be better at delivering certain types of dishes, I feel that BB is consistent - I don't remember ever having a dish that I didn't like and the highlights over time cannot be classified as a specific type. BB is also a very stylish spot and the service staff are helpful and extremely pleasant. This is one of my favorite food destinations in Montreal.  To reiterate: of my favorites, it is also the most consistent at delivering a solid dining experience. My muse was probably watching over, since it placed me within walking distance of Bouillon Bilk. . . Simple urban design, endless bar seating, low ceilings and dimmed lights set my mood right from the start. It's packed.  Always packed.  So do make reservations.  However - if you alone or do not mind eating at the bar, you can still score seat there. I asked sazerac as soon as I saw it on the list, but alas, it was not available that night, and my server (who was very helpful and nice, btw), recommended another drink of similar composition (name escapes me at the moment), which was incredibly well made. It's all started with perfect drink. . .  Followed by bread and butter. . .  Then, beautifully presented sweetbreads, veal tongue & celery root appetizer arrived.  My eyes lit up, and my taste buds started singing.  It was delicious.  But it was not over yet - my cleaned to the original shine plate disappeared magically, and in it place came main course - perfectly seared scallops, cauliflower, shiitake mushrooms & watercress.  I closed my eyes in joy and savored it piece by piece. . .  I was not planning on dessert (ok, that's a bold fat lie if you know me.  shhhh!), but I could not resist special that day - chocolate macaron, a scoop of ice cream & little cup of warmed wine, all together complimenting each other in taste pairing and in presentation. It was an amazing meal all together. For me, the class of Bouillon Bilk stands up there with Envy and Juni - with service, food and presentation being on the level that put it on the list of my forever favorites. FINALLY made it to Bouillon Bilk! It's been on my list for a very, very long time and the hype was definitely worth it.   First off, a 5:30pm reservation is definitely where it's at.  The restaurant opens exactly at 5:30 and you will be one of the first tables seated.  Within minutes, the rest of the place will be packed with all the other smart cookies who had the same plan as you.  That way you don't have to deal with too much of a backlog in the kitchen as you would if you were the second seating in the evening.  You even get the added bonus of dealing with extra-friendly staff at the beginning of service. In terms of decor, the crisp white tablecloths and the sparkling wine glasses are the first things you notice when you walk in the door.  In the middle of the dining room, the wooden bartop is attention-grabbing (Note to self: Ask to sit at the bar next time. . .  Just gorgeous!).  For service, the staff is VERY attentive and as another reviewer pointed out, they are absolute experts on the menu.  The waitress and chef were very accommodating for the dairy and nut allergies at our table.  Now, onto the foooooood: Lamb tartar - This was my first time trying lamb tartar and now I'm a big fan.  The combination of the smoky cabbage, crispy topping and some sort of stonefruit all on top of the lamb was just unreal.  Beef duo - Special of the night.  Grilled strip loin ("Melt-in-your-mouth") with braised beef cheeks (Super tender), veggies, mushroom and gnochhi (Original dish has butter, parmesan and sweet potato puree as well). Lobster cappelleti - Rich and indulgent, in the best way possible.  The mascarpone and cream filling was soooo savoury and satisfying.  Big chunks of lobster on top.  Crispy fried bits and some plainer green veggies on the side. . .  I was literally tasting perfection.  Chocolate ganache - With sour cream ice cream and lemon cream.  I was warned by previous reviews that dessert is not Bouillon Bilk's strong point.  I agree that it was average but there is nothing bad about the standard chocolate ganache.  To explain my four-star rating. . .  We both agreed (like other reviewers) that a five-star rating would be granted with slightly larger portion sizes.  Even after having three full courses, we were not that full.  Yes, the flavours, service and decor are top notch but just a little bit more food on their plates would be ideal!Very chic farm to table restaurant in Montreal has all the elements of a great restaurant.   Wine list was quite good with some reasonably priced gems.   Service was great and very attentive to all our requests (in English of course).   The highlights of the meal included the Hamachi appetizer, duck Margaret (two types of ducks) perfectly cooked, and the exceptional scallops.   If I lived here I would definitely go back!I really enjoyed my time here.  I loved the food.  Overall I would give it a 4. 5/5. We dropped in for our 8pm reservation.  The place was busy, there was a constant flow of people coming and going.  The host had this really awesome flower jacket, he was friendly and quick to offer to take our coats. Decor: Felt modern and elegant, with the white walls, which did make the place seem bigger.  However, there wasn't a lot of space between some of the tables.  Especially the single tables.  Would have liked just a bit more room to navigate.  They had a mix of different tables.  Higher wooden tables by the bar, and the shorter tables, with white table clothes in the main dining area.  Also some tables with booths. Service 3. 5/5There was a long wait between some of our appetizers and our main meal.  We didn't leave the restaurant until 2. 5 hours later.  They did forgot about 1 of our appetizers, so it was slow in coming out.  And then the main meal took a bit longer to come out.  Since there was a bigger group that put their order in before us.  They did apologize for the longer wait time, which was nice. Our server was great at describing every dish.  She was also very knowledgeable about the ingredients and the different wines that would pair well with our meal.  She was friendly and checked to make sure we had what we needed. Food 4. 5/5 Each and every dish was presented beautifully.  Truly works of art. Appetizer - Every appetizer we ordered was delicious. The sweetbreads were delicious and fried nice and soft.  This was my first time trying it and I really enjoyed it.  The veal tongue melted in your mouth.  It was soft and not chewy.  I loved the pear toffee reduction.  The toffee was unexpected, but add a nice sweet caramel taste.  The pear and toffee paired nicely with the sweetbreads and the tongue.  We order the special scallop amuse bouche twice because my boyfriend like it so much.  The scallops came with clementine and parsnip.  Scallops were fresh and succulent.  The sweetness of the scallops, were brought out by the clementine and lime juice.  The special appetizer of sashimi fluke was my favourite dish of the night.  I definitely had a wow moment after eating the dish.  It was that good.  This was accompanied by beets and plums.  That were sweet and delicious.  Fried capers were a lovely crunchy treat that added a crunchy texture to the dish.  Very pretty to look at.  MainVenison with hedgehog mushrooms.  Venison was very tender and delicious cooked perfectly.  The meat melted in your mouth.  The venison didn't have a gamey taste to it at all.  The inside was still pink and juicy.  This was served on a bed of quinoa with chestnuts and greens.   The chocolate coffee sauce brought the whole dish together.  I usually dislike chocolate in savoury dishes, but here the chocolate was light and not over powering.  My boyfriend ordered the sirloin steak with hedgehog mushrooms, snails and onions.  Steak was soft and pink in the centre.  You could truly taste the beef flavour coming through.  This was a good dish, but it was my least favourite dish of the night. We ordered the pear molasses cake with pear ginger, parsnip ice cream, to share.  I was truly blown away by the parsnip ice cream.  Who would think that this would make a nice ice cream flavour? It was really delicious and you could definitely taste the parsnip.  It was a nice way to finish the meal with something sweet but not overly sweet, which I find a lot of dessert can be.  It also wasn't too heavy, which was great especially after all the other food we ate. I would definitely come back to try their other dishes if I was in Montreal again. Found this restaurant on Eater's list of must eat restaurants in Montreal.  The restaurant is small w/ fine lines, white linen tables, and has a modern feel to it.  Street parking only.  The restaurant is a little tricky to find since there is no sign in front of the building itself, just the name on a semi hidden front entrance.  We totally missed the restaurant & walked 2 blocks too far until we realized we passed 1595.  Staff and service are both friendly.  There are 4 separate restrooms with a public sink area.  I definitely called the restaurant to make a reservation based on another yelper's recommendation.  Eating early definitely has its benefits.  We set the rsvp at 5:30 and sure enough the restaurant was packed by 6:30-7pm on a Monday evening.  For appetizers, we ordered:Cured mackerel w celery, green chickpeas, mint & rhubarb gelee (Amuse bouche of the day) - I didn't eat this dish bc I'm pregnant and it's "raw".  Hubby was thoroughly impressed & raved about this dish.  Steamed jumbo oyster w/ radish, pears & ginger fermented black bean broth (special of the day) - this oyster was packed a flavorful punch.  Everything worked so well together and the broth was magnificent. Pork shoulder tagliatelle - this dish was good, but we could of done without it.  Pasta was cooked perfectly and pork was tender.  The sour cream added a slight hint of "cheesy" tang that I didn't care for. Sweetbreads w/ veal tongue, celery root, shishito peppers & pineapple - WOW! This dish was amazing.  The sweetbreads were perfectly cooked & crispy, the veal tongue was tender & full of flavor, the celery root purée was silky smooth, the thinly shaved celery root was pickled just right and the char on the shishito peppers added a nice smokiness to the dish.  The little bits of caramelized pineapple added a nice amount of sweetness. For our entrees, we ordered: Halibut two ways w/ a broccoli purée & florets, shiitake mushrooms, potatoes, Muscat grapes & hazelnuts - the crispy halibut nugget was the best element of this dish.  The main halibut itself was delicate and tender, but had a slight fishy taste to it.  Not sure how fresh the quality of the fish was.   The grapes and onions added a little bit too much sweetness to the dish.  The shiitake mushrooms were bland and the broccoli florets were a little over cooked.  This dish was crying for acidity and a squeeze of lemon definitely helped.  Quail w/ quail egg, fava beans, potato, & parsnips (special of the evening) - OMG this dish was divine! Perfectly seasoned & cooked quail.  The quail was slightly crisp and the sauce that came w it was smooth and rich.  All of the elements were superb.  Overall, we would totally return to this restaurant bc everything was executed well and the flavor profiles of each dish was exceptional (except for minor issues w/ the tagliatelle and halibut).  The only thing I didn't like about this restaurant was the inflexibility of the chef/cooks not wanting to cook any proteins above medium rare.  For someone who is pregnant and careful with how her food is prepared, I would have appreciated it if the chef/cook was willing to cook the protein to at least medium/medium well so that there's less of a potential illness or harm to my unborn child.  For that reason, I had to go with the halibut dish which I wasn't that impressed with.  I definitely recommend this restaurant.  Some yelpers commented on how small the portions are, but if the server times out each course right, the dishes are actually filling.  If not, fill up on their complimentary bread and butter!Absolutely excellent.  I started with the New Orleans and negroni Blanc cocktails and both ere outstanding.  Then we moved onto the starters of himachi and the beet salad were both perfectly blended in terms of contrasting flavours.  T he scallops and the venison were both outstanding, it was hard to decide which was better.  The pumpkin cake dessert was also a highlight.  $230 for two people including tip!Our lunch at Bouillon Bilk is in a heated battle with our subsequent dinner at Liverpool House for best meal in Montreal.  Since I was soberer for the former, Bouillon Bilk gets a wink and a gun as the de facto winner.  Our larger party mostly hadn't arrived in Montreal yet, and as such, we took the opportunity to squeeze in a fancy pants lunch at nearby Bouillon Bilk. We arrived right as it opened, sans reservations, and were lucky to be seated.  Within 15 minutes, the dining room was packed with patrons on a Friday morning.  So I think we made a good choice. The menu, officially described as Canadian (New), was overtly French-influenced and not unlike the multitude of good "American (New)" places you find in major cities like Chicago or San Francisco.  Separating the wheat from the chaff is often difficult, but in Boullion Bilk's case, I feel comfortable designating it the former. Despite the weekend of indulgences awaiting us, we still went overboard with the lunch.  For starters, we went Kayne-style ham, getting oysters, foie, and tartare (tuna or hamachi, can't remember which).  All just fantastic, but at a French-inspired place, the foie better be a cut above, and it was. For mains, I had a hard time deciding between the octopus and the duck confit, two personal French favorites that are well worth the coin when cooked well.  I opted for the former while my compadre did the latter.  Again, both dishes were wholly excellent.  Overall, lunch at Bouillon Bilk was a great starter kit to a fun weekend. - BOTTOM LINE:By far the BEST BEST meal we had in Montreal (and this included Au Pied de Cochon). . . perhaps the best meal I've had in a few years.  Make reservations in advance.  The walk to Bouillon Bilk was not far from downtown and also close to a ton of great bars for post-dinner nightcaps. - THE SERVICE:We stumbled into Bouillon Bilk reservation-less and the French skills of an infant.  The hostess told us the wait would be two hours and we were disappointed but definitely not surprised.  Then, she smiled and said what the heck, and managed to squeeze us 4 in right then and there in a fantastic corner table.  THANK YOU for giving us the gift of this meal! I do not know your name, but you had a really cute blue shirt with artichokes on it.  The rest of the staff was awesome as well.  The menu was clearly explained to us and our cups remained happily filled with cocktails and water throughout the meal. - THE SPACE:Intimate but unpretentious.  Great for parents, dates, and old friends. - THE FOOD:Amazing.  Spectacular.  Our fois gras on toast, strawberries, and beets hit every note of texture and flavor imaginable.  Us four shared this appetizer and were all able to get ample bites of the fois gras.  The fruit and beets provided a refreshing break from the heaviness of the fois gras. I had the special of the day - veal 3 ways (veal cutlet, veal sweetbreads, and veal pastrami) and it was phenomenal.  What an experience.  The cutlet was perfectly cooked and medium rare, the sweetbreads crispy and juicy, and the pastrami perfectly salty and fatty.  I really appreciated how much they try to push the envelope but still keep their flavors true and homey.  My boyfriends sea bass had the crispiest skin ever.  I aspire to cook fish that well. Overall, an amazing experience at this place.  I'm so glad we managed to squeeze in here without a reservation. . . but I suggest you make one in advance! It was by the most memorable food experience we had in Montreal. This restaurant became, immediately, my new favorite restaurant in all of Montreal.  As a frequent visitor of the beautiful city, it wasn't until my most recent trip that I decided to give this place a visit.  The food here is absolute perfection.  Everyone at the table raved about the food.  Everything is prepared perfectly from presentation to taste to texture.  This place defines culinary execution.  I ordered the halibut and it tasted as if it were caught that day.   The cooking temperature ensured that the freshness of the fish hit me upon my first bite, at which time the flesh melts softly on the palate giving way to the sweet scent of the ocean.  That same consistency carries through the meal from the first bite to the last.  The perfect execution even carries to the vegetables and fingerling potatoes.  A million kudos the the chef.  The sommelier was able to offer the perfect selection to pair with our dishes.  All in all this made for the perfect dining experience. Before this meal, my favorite all time meal had been at Charlie Trotter's in Chicago.  That meal is now tied with the one I had at Bouillon Bilk.   Very interesting menu, creative flavor and texture combinations, amazing execution, beautiful presentation, and spectacular service.  The beet salad is transformative.  I also loved the lobster amuse-bouche, the scallops, the venison, the chocolate financier.  This is a very special dining experience.  Bravo!This was our favorite restaurant in Montreal. We arrived after hours of riding bikes.  We were casually dressed, sweaty, and covered in dust; however, the employees at Bouillon Bilk welcomed us just like the best dressed folks there.  We saw everybody at Bouillon Bilk.  There were beautifully dressed people in the restaurant as well as a casually dressed family. The restaurant itself is gorgeous.  The front windows let in lots of natural light.  The lines are straight and clean.  The elements were modern.  For example, the sink was outside of the bathroom and was long and communal.  It was really neat and surprising. And then the food.  M ordered the duck.  It was amazing.  She let me try some.  It was tender and melted in your mouth.  It melted and it mixed with the sauce and contrasted with the fresh greens.  It was a full song with harmony. I got the cucumber salad.  I love the freshness of cucumber and Bouillon Bilk took that characteristic and let it shine.  It was enhanced with a few radishes, some goat cheese and some crispy nuts.  It was crunchy, soft, and light. Next, we got three desserts: a cheese plate, strawberries, and chocolate.  Yum, yum, and YUM! When we first made our reservation, we were told that the table would need to be free by 8:00 PM.  As that time drew closer, and we were still enjoying our dessert, I asked our server.  He encouraged us to linger and submit to the pleasures before us. Our server also told us about our next favorite restaurant in Montreal: Hotel Herman.  We would have gone to Bouillon Bilk every evening if the menu was more extensive.  But that's some of the poetry of Bouillon Bilk.  It knows what it can do and it executes it will finesse. I love the name of this restaurant, WOO for alliteration.  Boullion Bilk - it's fun to say.  I find the name attractive as well as everything inside - environment and cuisine.  All appealing and cool and lovely.  The decor is extremely simple and clean.  Wooden floors, white walls, white tablecloths and napkins, big heavy wooden tables.  No crazy artwork or light fixtures, just simple textures and clean lines.  We started with the "Quebec Cheese Assortment" (5 cheeses for $20 or 3 for $15).  Of course we got 5, and they were each local and incredible.  I can't remember the exact names of each cheese, and I know they rotate depending on what's available, but they're five very different and beautiful options.  We ate every single bite, of course.  What's better than cheese?? I can't think of anything. For my entree, I ordered the scallop dish which comes with zucchini, shiitake mushrooms, pear, and watercress served in a brown butter.  Oh my stars, you guys.  These scallops were the most buttery, perfectly seared, velvety pieces of fish everrrr.  The brown butter was rich and fantastic and the pear provided a really interesting sweetness.  This particular dish was $31 which is a bit pricey considering the small portion.  It's enough food for one person surely, a healthy size, but I was craving a bit more in the end.  Wonderful wine menu here as well with some great local options. If you're in the mood for pretty plating and a business class type of atmosphere, Boullion Bilk is the perfect spot.  Service was down-to-earth and friendly, and despite my last minute booking we were able to nab a table for 3 on a Friday night.   Granted, we were only given a 10-minute window to actually get to the restaurant, but as we lived nearby anyway it wasn't too much of an issue.  With the goal to stuff myself silly with foie gras over the weekend, I started the meal with a foie gras appetizer.  A generous slab of deliciously seared foie, sitting on top of a slice of toasted brioche and prettily dotted by pureed raspberries and a beet reduction.  Apart from their regular menu were also a few daily special additions for the night (of which I unfortunately can't remember), but the scallops entree had caught my eye already anyway.   3 scallops in drool-inducing browned butter, the portion is a tad scanty but it makes me hungry just reminiscing about it.   My scallops were a tad bit overcooked - though far from the dreaded rubbery state, my inner bratty food snob says it could've used a literal *touch* less heat to retain more umami mouthfeel.   Hey, I did admit that it's quite bratty of me to point out such a minor detail - cause it was otherwise delicious.  The dessert, a rhubarb, strawberries and juniper dish with lime gremolata and little islands of buttermilk cream seemed to float in a translucent pinkish red pool, which turned out to be a very thin layer of set rhubarb gel.   Lovely dishes and all-around lovely place. There is a reason Buillon Bilk was named one of the restaurants to try in Montreal before you die.  This place is fabulous.  At first, the restaurant's exterior and interior decor is very plain.  You wouldn't expect this place to have it all.  But I came here not for the decor.  I came for the vibrant and decorative menu as well as the nightly specials.  Each dish from appetizers to dessert was thoroughly planned out with complimenting ingredients, bold colors and overwhelming flavors.  Calling the items I enjoyed fantastic was not enough.  I came here already full from the day's endless eating but had to make an attempt to sit down at Buillon Bilk on my last night in Montreal to try something.  I had the lobster appetizer and sea urchin linguini.  Both appetizers were drop dead fabulous! I can't imagine how numbing everything else on the menu could be.  I'm at a lost for words.  I could die happy.  Note to self: Come back to Montreal for more Buillon Bilk. This meal is right there with the best meals I've ever had.  The restaurant itself is small and trendy, and the hosts and waitstaff all very polite and knowledgable.  While the ambiance of the space and the attentiveness of our waiter definitely contributed to the experience, the real star of the night was the food. We started with cocktails and appetizers; the hamachi, and the sweetbreads with veal tongue.  The hamachi was served raw, and was paired with yuzu kosho, grapefruit, fennel, and cucumber.  Delicious, clean, and light.  The sweetbreads may have been the single best thing I had all night, and both they and the tongue were melt in your mouth tender.  For our entrees we had duck three ways (dumpling, breast, and heart), and halibut two ways (filet, and fried cheek).  All three variations of the duck were amazing.  The heart was meaty and tasty without being gamey, the breast was tender and paired perfectly with the cara cara orange, and the dumpling was good enough to be a dish of its own.  The fish was just as good, especially the cheek, which flaked apart as soon as the fork hit it.  We ended our meal with a pistachio financier served with black current, white chocolate, and basil.  Just sweet enough, and the perfect ending to a great meal.  The courteousness of the staff, the beautiful plating, and most importantly the flavor of the food make Bouillon Bilk a must try. This is a beautiful take on modern gourmet Canadian/North-American cuisine.  The restaurant itself is bare-walled and plain, and it's very a loud yet somehow intimate setting.  The waitstaff was a bit cold, but they were generally helpful with any questions we had with the menu. My friend ordered the rabbit and ravioli, and I ordered the halibut two ways (fried and sous-vide).  The portions here appear small, but they aren't ludicrously small.  After the bread and my entree, I was satisfied.  The halibut was excellent fried and even better sous-vide; I'd never had sous-vide before, but it was incredibly tender and moist. After the meal, we ordered the yogurt & mango & papaya dessert, and it was excellent.  Seriously the most creative and delicious dessert I've ever had.  Each component of the dessert blended together beautifully while being distinct flavors.  The contrast of texture was something that I've never seen executed so masterfully in a dessert.  You must order this dessert!Boy was our dinner at Buoillon Bilk the best meal we had in Montreal, maybe even one of the best dinners I've had, period!  We tried making a reservation the night before our actual dinner but it was completely booked.  Now I understand why!Firstly, the restaurant is beautiful, despite the confusing, yellow awning it stands under.   The interior is outrageously chic with plentiful seating and a cool bar area, where we dined.   Secondly, the staff is super friendly, in an unpretentious way.   Moreover, the food was AWESOME!  We ordered a dozen oysters to start with and to get our libidos going.   They were a mouthful, fresh and came with 3 sauces that one can do with or without.   For our entrees, we ordered the cod fish and scallops, both of which were gorgeously plated and delicious!!  My cod fish was so moist that it collapsed upon the stab of my fork (t'was a gentle stab).   The garnishments on the plate also paired very well with the fish.   The scallops were also perfectly seared with garnishments that complimented the shellfish very well.   We devoured every single last bit of our artistic entrees AND ordered the upside down peach cake with ice cream for dessert, which left us leaving the restaurant with nothing but satisfaction!Thank you Buoillon Bilk for a memorable meal that made our trip to Montreal that much more amazing!Great restaurant overall. Every single dish was impressive, rich and full of different flavors in great harmony. Service is outstanding, all simple details were just right. Loved everything.  We enjoyed a lovely evening. For our 1 year, my husband took me to a really fancy french restaurant called Bouillon Bilk , it took roughly 30 mins to walk there - this restaurant is located at a very sketch place.  There were construction everywhere and homeless tents were close to the area. . .  I seriously wonder why they decided to open a restaurant in this area?The food was superb though, the service is also fantastic.  The server pretty much memorized the menu, he told me about the special they were having $5 for 3 shrimps.  So I said why not! I should had known. . . . . .  tiny tiny tiny shrimps.  Picture below.  Well, I guess I kinda got 3 and a 1/2 shrimp.  He was being very generous.   I got the pasta.  Oh - it was delicious! I tried so so so hard to not just eat it all in one bite.  So I took little bites so my meal would last longer.  I am not meant to eat at a french cuisine. My husband had the short ribs Equally as good. The portion is wayyyyyyy too small for me.  I would have to order 5 plates to fill me up!Bouillon Bilk (BB) is one of the few places in Montreal that all my chef friends consistently recommend.  They pay attention to what these folks are doing.  I've been here for lunch or dinner well over 30 times the last few years (I often take work-related visitors for dinner here) and have never been disappointed.  Menu changes occur sufficiently often that it makes little sense to give details about the specific dishes I tried this time.  While some restaurants tend to be better at delivering certain types of dishes, I feel that BB is consistent - I don't remember ever having a dish that I didn't like and the highlights over time cannot be classified as a specific type. BB is also a very stylish spot and the service staff are helpful and extremely pleasant. This is one of my favorite food destinations in Montreal.  To reiterate: of my favorites, it is also the most consistent at delivering a solid dining experience. My muse was probably watching over, since it placed me within walking distance of Bouillon Bilk. . . Simple urban design, endless bar seating, low ceilings and dimmed lights set my mood right from the start. It's packed.  Always packed.  So do make reservations.  However - if you alone or do not mind eating at the bar, you can still score seat there. I asked sazerac as soon as I saw it on the list, but alas, it was not available that night, and my server (who was very helpful and nice, btw), recommended another drink of similar composition (name escapes me at the moment), which was incredibly well made. It's all started with perfect drink. . .  Followed by bread and butter. . .  Then, beautifully presented sweetbreads, veal tongue & celery root appetizer arrived.  My eyes lit up, and my taste buds started singing.  It was delicious.  But it was not over yet - my cleaned to the original shine plate disappeared magically, and in it place came main course - perfectly seared scallops, cauliflower, shiitake mushrooms & watercress.  I closed my eyes in joy and savored it piece by piece. . .  I was not planning on dessert (ok, that's a bold fat lie if you know me.  shhhh!), but I could not resist special that day - chocolate macaron, a scoop of ice cream & little cup of warmed wine, all together complimenting each other in taste pairing and in presentation. It was an amazing meal all together. For me, the class of Bouillon Bilk stands up there with Envy and Juni - with service, food and presentation being on the level that put it on the list of my forever favorites. FINALLY made it to Bouillon Bilk! It's been on my list for a very, very long time and the hype was definitely worth it.   First off, a 5:30pm reservation is definitely where it's at.  The restaurant opens exactly at 5:30 and you will be one of the first tables seated.  Within minutes, the rest of the place will be packed with all the other smart cookies who had the same plan as you.  That way you don't have to deal with too much of a backlog in the kitchen as you would if you were the second seating in the evening.  You even get the added bonus of dealing with extra-friendly staff at the beginning of service. In terms of decor, the crisp white tablecloths and the sparkling wine glasses are the first things you notice when you walk in the door.  In the middle of the dining room, the wooden bartop is attention-grabbing (Note to self: Ask to sit at the bar next time. . .  Just gorgeous!).  For service, the staff is VERY attentive and as another reviewer pointed out, they are absolute experts on the menu.  The waitress and chef were very accommodating for the dairy and nut allergies at our table.  Now, onto the foooooood: Lamb tartar - This was my first time trying lamb tartar and now I'm a big fan.  The combination of the smoky cabbage, crispy topping and some sort of stonefruit all on top of the lamb was just unreal.  Beef duo - Special of the night.  Grilled strip loin ("Melt-in-your-mouth") with braised beef cheeks (Super tender), veggies, mushroom and gnochhi (Original dish has butter, parmesan and sweet potato puree as well). Lobster cappelleti - Rich and indulgent, in the best way possible.  The mascarpone and cream filling was soooo savoury and satisfying.  Big chunks of lobster on top.  Crispy fried bits and some plainer green veggies on the side. . .  I was literally tasting perfection.  Chocolate ganache - With sour cream ice cream and lemon cream.  I was warned by previous reviews that dessert is not Bouillon Bilk's strong point.  I agree that it was average but there is nothing bad about the standard chocolate ganache.  To explain my four-star rating. . .  We both agreed (like other reviewers) that a five-star rating would be granted with slightly larger portion sizes.  Even after having three full courses, we were not that full.  Yes, the flavours, service and decor are top notch but just a little bit more food on their plates would be ideal!Very chic farm to table restaurant in Montreal has all the elements of a great restaurant.   Wine list was quite good with some reasonably priced gems.   Service was great and very attentive to all our requests (in English of course).   The highlights of the meal included the Hamachi appetizer, duck Margaret (two types of ducks) perfectly cooked, and the exceptional scallops.   If I lived here I would definitely go back!I really enjoyed my time here.  I loved the food.  Overall I would give it a 4. 5/5. We dropped in for our 8pm reservation.  The place was busy, there was a constant flow of people coming and going.  The host had this really awesome flower jacket, he was friendly and quick to offer to take our coats. Decor: Felt modern and elegant, with the white walls, which did make the place seem bigger.  However, there wasn't a lot of space between some of the tables.  Especially the single tables.  Would have liked just a bit more room to navigate.  They had a mix of different tables.  Higher wooden tables by the bar, and the shorter tables, with white table clothes in the main dining area.  Also some tables with booths. Service 3. 5/5There was a long wait between some of our appetizers and our main meal.  We didn't leave the restaurant until 2. 5 hours later.  They did forgot about 1 of our appetizers, so it was slow in coming out.  And then the main meal took a bit longer to come out.  Since there was a bigger group that put their order in before us.  They did apologize for the longer wait time, which was nice. Our server was great at describing every dish.  She was also very knowledgeable about the ingredients and the different wines that would pair well with our meal.  She was friendly and checked to make sure we had what we needed. Food 4. 5/5 Each and every dish was presented beautifully.  Truly works of art. Appetizer - Every appetizer we ordered was delicious. The sweetbreads were delicious and fried nice and soft.  This was my first time trying it and I really enjoyed it.  The veal tongue melted in your mouth.  It was soft and not chewy.  I loved the pear toffee reduction.  The toffee was unexpected, but add a nice sweet caramel taste.  The pear and toffee paired nicely with the sweetbreads and the tongue.  We order the special scallop amuse bouche twice because my boyfriend like it so much.  The scallops came with clementine and parsnip.  Scallops were fresh and succulent.  The sweetness of the scallops, were brought out by the clementine and lime juice.  The special appetizer of sashimi fluke was my favourite dish of the night.  I definitely had a wow moment after eating the dish.  It was that good.  This was accompanied by beets and plums.  That were sweet and delicious.  Fried capers were a lovely crunchy treat that added a crunchy texture to the dish.  Very pretty to look at.  MainVenison with hedgehog mushrooms.  Venison was very tender and delicious cooked perfectly.  The meat melted in your mouth.  The venison didn't have a gamey taste to it at all.  The inside was still pink and juicy.  This was served on a bed of quinoa with chestnuts and greens.   The chocolate coffee sauce brought the whole dish together.  I usually dislike chocolate in savoury dishes, but here the chocolate was light and not over powering.  My boyfriend ordered the sirloin steak with hedgehog mushrooms, snails and onions.  Steak was soft and pink in the centre.  You could truly taste the beef flavour coming through.  This was a good dish, but it was my least favourite dish of the night. We ordered the pear molasses cake with pear ginger, parsnip ice cream, to share.  I was truly blown away by the parsnip ice cream.  Who would think that this would make a nice ice cream flavour? It was really delicious and you could definitely taste the parsnip.  It was a nice way to finish the meal with something sweet but not overly sweet, which I find a lot of dessert can be.  It also wasn't too heavy, which was great especially after all the other food we ate. I would definitely come back to try their other dishes if I was in Montreal again. Found this restaurant on Eater's list of must eat restaurants in Montreal.  The restaurant is small w/ fine lines, white linen tables, and has a modern feel to it.  Street parking only.  The restaurant is a little tricky to find since there is no sign in front of the building itself, just the name on a semi hidden front entrance.  We totally missed the restaurant & walked 2 blocks too far until we realized we passed 1595.  Staff and service are both friendly.  There are 4 separate restrooms with a public sink area.  I definitely called the restaurant to make a reservation based on another yelper's recommendation.  Eating early definitely has its benefits.  We set the rsvp at 5:30 and sure enough the restaurant was packed by 6:30-7pm on a Monday evening.  For appetizers, we ordered:Cured mackerel w celery, green chickpeas, mint & rhubarb gelee (Amuse bouche of the day) - I didn't eat this dish bc I'm pregnant and it's "raw".  Hubby was thoroughly impressed & raved about this dish.  Steamed jumbo oyster w/ radish, pears & ginger fermented black bean broth (special of the day) - this oyster was packed a flavorful punch.  Everything worked so well together and the broth was magnificent. Pork shoulder tagliatelle - this dish was good, but we could of done without it.  Pasta was cooked perfectly and pork was tender.  The sour cream added a slight hint of "cheesy" tang that I didn't care for. Sweetbreads w/ veal tongue, celery root, shishito peppers & pineapple - WOW! This dish was amazing.  The sweetbreads were perfectly cooked & crispy, the veal tongue was tender & full of flavor, the celery root purée was silky smooth, the thinly shaved celery root was pickled just right and the char on the shishito peppers added a nice smokiness to the dish.  The little bits of caramelized pineapple added a nice amount of sweetness. For our entrees, we ordered: Halibut two ways w/ a broccoli purée & florets, shiitake mushrooms, potatoes, Muscat grapes & hazelnuts - the crispy halibut nugget was the best element of this dish.  The main halibut itself was delicate and tender, but had a slight fishy taste to it.  Not sure how fresh the quality of the fish was.   The grapes and onions added a little bit too much sweetness to the dish.  The shiitake mushrooms were bland and the broccoli florets were a little over cooked.  This dish was crying for acidity and a squeeze of lemon definitely helped.  Quail w/ quail egg, fava beans, potato, & parsnips (special of the evening) - OMG this dish was divine! Perfectly seasoned & cooked quail.  The quail was slightly crisp and the sauce that came w it was smooth and rich.  All of the elements were superb.  Overall, we would totally return to this restaurant bc everything was executed well and the flavor profiles of each dish was exceptional (except for minor issues w/ the tagliatelle and halibut).  The only thing I didn't like about this restaurant was the inflexibility of the chef/cooks not wanting to cook any proteins above medium rare.  For someone who is pregnant and careful with how her food is prepared, I would have appreciated it if the chef/cook was willing to cook the protein to at least medium/medium well so that there's less of a potential illness or harm to my unborn child.  For that reason, I had to go with the halibut dish which I wasn't that impressed with.  I definitely recommend this restaurant.  Some yelpers commented on how small the portions are, but if the server times out each course right, the dishes are actually filling.  If not, fill up on their complimentary bread and butter!Absolutely excellent.  I started with the New Orleans and negroni Blanc cocktails and both ere outstanding.  Then we moved onto the starters of himachi and the beet salad were both perfectly blended in terms of contrasting flavours.  T he scallops and the venison were both outstanding, it was hard to decide which was better.  The pumpkin cake dessert was also a highlight.  $230 for two people including tip!Our lunch at Bouillon Bilk is in a heated battle with our subsequent dinner at Liverpool House for best meal in Montreal.  Since I was soberer for the former, Bouillon Bilk gets a wink and a gun as the de facto winner.  Our larger party mostly hadn't arrived in Montreal yet, and as such, we took the opportunity to squeeze in a fancy pants lunch at nearby Bouillon Bilk. We arrived right as it opened, sans reservations, and were lucky to be seated.  Within 15 minutes, the dining room was packed with patrons on a Friday morning.  So I think we made a good choice. The menu, officially described as Canadian (New), was overtly French-influenced and not unlike the multitude of good "American (New)" places you find in major cities like Chicago or San Francisco.  Separating the wheat from the chaff is often difficult, but in Boullion Bilk's case, I feel comfortable designating it the former. Despite the weekend of indulgences awaiting us, we still went overboard with the lunch.  For starters, we went Kayne-style ham, getting oysters, foie, and tartare (tuna or hamachi, can't remember which).  All just fantastic, but at a French-inspired place, the foie better be a cut above, and it was. For mains, I had a hard time deciding between the octopus and the duck confit, two personal French favorites that are well worth the coin when cooked well.  I opted for the former while my compadre did the latter.  Again, both dishes were wholly excellent.  Overall, lunch at Bouillon Bilk was a great starter kit to a fun weekend. - BOTTOM LINE:By far the BEST BEST meal we had in Montreal (and this included Au Pied de Cochon). . . perhaps the best meal I've had in a few years.  Make reservations in advance.  The walk to Bouillon Bilk was not far from downtown and also close to a ton of great bars for post-dinner nightcaps. - THE SERVICE:We stumbled into Bouillon Bilk reservation-less and the French skills of an infant.  The hostess told us the wait would be two hours and we were disappointed but definitely not surprised.  Then, she smiled and said what the heck, and managed to squeeze us 4 in right then and there in a fantastic corner table.  THANK YOU for giving us the gift of this meal! I do not know your name, but you had a really cute blue shirt with artichokes on it.  The rest of the staff was awesome as well.  The menu was clearly explained to us and our cups remained happily filled with cocktails and water throughout the meal. - THE SPACE:Intimate but unpretentious.  Great for parents, dates, and old friends. - THE FOOD:Amazing.  Spectacular.  Our fois gras on toast, strawberries, and beets hit every note of texture and flavor imaginable.  Us four shared this appetizer and were all able to get ample bites of the fois gras.  The fruit and beets provided a refreshing break from the heaviness of the fois gras. I had the special of the day - veal 3 ways (veal cutlet, veal sweetbreads, and veal pastrami) and it was phenomenal.  What an experience.  The cutlet was perfectly cooked and medium rare, the sweetbreads crispy and juicy, and the pastrami perfectly salty and fatty.  I really appreciated how much they try to push the envelope but still keep their flavors true and homey.  My boyfriends sea bass had the crispiest skin ever.  I aspire to cook fish that well. Overall, an amazing experience at this place.  I'm so glad we managed to squeeze in here without a reservation. . . but I suggest you make one in advance! It was by the most memorable food experience we had in Montreal. This restaurant became, immediately, my new favorite restaurant in all of Montreal.  As a frequent visitor of the beautiful city, it wasn't until my most recent trip that I decided to give this place a visit.  The food here is absolute perfection.  Everyone at the table raved about the food.  Everything is prepared perfectly from presentation to taste to texture.  This place defines culinary execution.  I ordered the halibut and it tasted as if it were caught that day.   The cooking temperature ensured that the freshness of the fish hit me upon my first bite, at which time the flesh melts softly on the palate giving way to the sweet scent of the ocean.  That same consistency carries through the meal from the first bite to the last.  The perfect execution even carries to the vegetables and fingerling potatoes.  A million kudos the the chef.  The sommelier was able to offer the perfect selection to pair with our dishes.  All in all this made for the perfect dining experience. Before this meal, my favorite all time meal had been at Charlie Trotter's in Chicago.  That meal is now tied with the one I had at Bouillon Bilk.   Very interesting menu, creative flavor and texture combinations, amazing execution, beautiful presentation, and spectacular service.  The beet salad is transformative.  I also loved the lobster amuse-bouche, the scallops, the venison, the chocolate financier.  This is a very special dining experience.  Bravo!This was our favorite restaurant in Montreal. We arrived after hours of riding bikes.  We were casually dressed, sweaty, and covered in dust; however, the employees at Bouillon Bilk welcomed us just like the best dressed folks there.  We saw everybody at Bouillon Bilk.  There were beautifully dressed people in the restaurant as well as a casually dressed family. The restaurant itself is gorgeous.  The front windows let in lots of natural light.  The lines are straight and clean.  The elements were modern.  For example, the sink was outside of the bathroom and was long and communal.  It was really neat and surprising. And then the food.  M ordered the duck.  It was amazing.  She let me try some.  It was tender and melted in your mouth.  It melted and it mixed with the sauce and contrasted with the fresh greens.  It was a full song with harmony. I got the cucumber salad.  I love the freshness of cucumber and Bouillon Bilk took that characteristic and let it shine.  It was enhanced with a few radishes, some goat cheese and some crispy nuts.  It was crunchy, soft, and light. Next, we got three desserts: a cheese plate, strawberries, and chocolate.  Yum, yum, and YUM! When we first made our reservation, we were told that the table would need to be free by 8:00 PM.  As that time drew closer, and we were still enjoying our dessert, I asked our server.  He encouraged us to linger and submit to the pleasures before us. Our server also told us about our next favorite restaurant in Montreal: Hotel Herman.  We would have gone to Bouillon Bilk every evening if the menu was more extensive.  But that's some of the poetry of Bouillon Bilk.  It knows what it can do and it executes it will finesse. I love the name of this restaurant, WOO for alliteration.  Boullion Bilk - it's fun to say.  I find the name attractive as well as everything inside - environment and cuisine.  All appealing and cool and lovely.  The decor is extremely simple and clean.  Wooden floors, white walls, white tablecloths and napkins, big heavy wooden tables.  No crazy artwork or light fixtures, just simple textures and clean lines.  We started with the "Quebec Cheese Assortment" (5 cheeses for $20 or 3 for $15).  Of course we got 5, and they were each local and incredible.  I can't remember the exact names of each cheese, and I know they rotate depending on what's available, but they're five very different and beautiful options.  We ate every single bite, of course.  What's better than cheese?? I can't think of anything. For my entree, I ordered the scallop dish which comes with zucchini, shiitake mushrooms, pear, and watercress served in a brown butter.  Oh my stars, you guys.  These scallops were the most buttery, perfectly seared, velvety pieces of fish everrrr.  The brown butter was rich and fantastic and the pear provided a really interesting sweetness.  This particular dish was $31 which is a bit pricey considering the small portion.  It's enough food for one person surely, a healthy size, but I was craving a bit more in the end.  Wonderful wine menu here as well with some great local options. If you're in the mood for pretty plating and a business class type of atmosphere, Boullion Bilk is the perfect spot.  Service was down-to-earth and friendly, and despite my last minute booking we were able to nab a table for 3 on a Friday night.   Granted, we were only given a 10-minute window to actually get to the restaurant, but as we lived nearby anyway it wasn't too much of an issue.  With the goal to stuff myself silly with foie gras over the weekend, I started the meal with a foie gras appetizer.  A generous slab of deliciously seared foie, sitting on top of a slice of toasted brioche and prettily dotted by pureed raspberries and a beet reduction.  Apart from their regular menu were also a few daily special additions for the night (of which I unfortunately can't remember), but the scallops entree had caught my eye already anyway.   3 scallops in drool-inducing browned butter, the portion is a tad scanty but it makes me hungry just reminiscing about it.   My scallops were a tad bit overcooked - though far from the dreaded rubbery state, my inner bratty food snob says it could've used a literal *touch* less heat to retain more umami mouthfeel.   Hey, I did admit that it's quite bratty of me to point out such a minor detail - cause it was otherwise delicious.  The dessert, a rhubarb, strawberries and juniper dish with lime gremolata and little islands of buttermilk cream seemed to float in a translucent pinkish red pool, which turned out to be a very thin layer of set rhubarb gel.   Lovely dishes and all-around lovely place. There is a reason Buillon Bilk was named one of the restaurants to try in Montreal before you die.  This place is fabulous.  At first, the restaurant's exterior and interior decor is very plain.  You wouldn't expect this place to have it all.  But I came here not for the decor.  I came for the vibrant and decorative menu as well as the nightly specials.  Each dish from appetizers to dessert was thoroughly planned out with complimenting ingredients, bold colors and overwhelming flavors.  Calling the items I enjoyed fantastic was not enough.  I came here already full from the day's endless eating but had to make an attempt to sit down at Buillon Bilk on my last night in Montreal to try something.  I had the lobster appetizer and sea urchin linguini.  Both appetizers were drop dead fabulous! I can't imagine how numbing everything else on the menu could be.  I'm at a lost for words.  I could die happy.  Note to self: Come back to Montreal for more Buillon Bilk. This meal is right there with the best meals I've ever had.  The restaurant itself is small and trendy, and the hosts and waitstaff all very polite and knowledgable.  While the ambiance of the space and the attentiveness of our waiter definitely contributed to the experience, the real star of the night was the food. We started with cocktails and appetizers; the hamachi, and the sweetbreads with veal tongue.  The hamachi was served raw, and was paired with yuzu kosho, grapefruit, fennel, and cucumber.  Delicious, clean, and light.  The sweetbreads may have been the single best thing I had all night, and both they and the tongue were melt in your mouth tender.  For our entrees we had duck three ways (dumpling, breast, and heart), and halibut two ways (filet, and fried cheek).  All three variations of the duck were amazing.  The heart was meaty and tasty without being gamey, the breast was tender and paired perfectly with the cara cara orange, and the dumpling was good enough to be a dish of its own.  The fish was just as good, especially the cheek, which flaked apart as soon as the fork hit it.  We ended our meal with a pistachio financier served with black current, white chocolate, and basil.  Just sweet enough, and the perfect ending to a great meal.  The courteousness of the staff, the beautiful plating, and most importantly the flavor of the food make Bouillon Bilk a must try. This is a beautiful take on modern gourmet Canadian/North-American cuisine.  The restaurant itself is bare-walled and plain, and it's very a loud yet somehow intimate setting.  The waitstaff was a bit cold, but they were generally helpful with any questions we had with the menu. My friend ordered the rabbit and ravioli, and I ordered the halibut two ways (fried and sous-vide).  The portions here appear small, but they aren't ludicrously small.

After the meal, we ordered the yogurt & mango & papaya dessert, and it was excellent.  Seriously the most creative and delicious dessert I've ever had.  Each component of the dessert blended together beautifully while being distinct flavors.  The contrast of texture was something that I've never seen executed so masterfully in a dessert.  You must order this dessert!Boy was our dinner at Buoillon Bilk the best meal we had in Montreal, maybe even one of the best dinners I've had, period!  We tried making a reservation the night before our actual dinner but it was completely booked.

Every single dish was impressive, rich and full of different flavors in great harmony. Service is outstanding, all simple details were just right. Loved everything.  We enjoyed a lovely evening. For our 1 year, my husband took me to a really fancy french restaurant called Bouillon Bilk , it took roughly 30 mins to walk there - this restaurant is located at a very sketch place.  There were construction everywhere and homeless tents were close to the area. . .  I seriously wonder why they decided to open a restaurant in this area?The food was superb though, the service is also fantastic.  The server pretty much memorized the menu, he told me about the special they were having $5 for 3 shrimps.  So I said why not! I should had known. . . . . .  tiny tiny tiny shrimps.  Picture below.  Well, I guess I kinda got 3 and a 1/2 shrimp.  He was being very generous.   I got the pasta.  Oh - it was delicious! I tried so so so hard to not just eat it all in one bite.  So I took little bites so my meal would last longer.  I am not meant to eat at a french cuisine. My husband had the short ribs Equally as good. The portion is wayyyyyyy too small for me.  I would have to order 5 plates to fill me up!Bouillon Bilk (BB) is one of the few places in Montreal that all my chef friends consistently recommend.  They pay attention to what these folks are doing.  I've been here for lunch or dinner well over 30 times the last few years (I often take work-related visitors for dinner here) and have never been disappointed.  Menu changes occur sufficiently often that it makes little sense to give details about the specific dishes I tried this time.  While some restaurants tend to be better at delivering certain types of dishes, I feel that BB is consistent - I don't remember ever having a dish that I didn't like and the highlights over time cannot be classified as a specific type. BB is also a very stylish spot and the service staff are helpful and extremely pleasant. This is one of my favorite food destinations in Montreal.  To reiterate: of my favorites, it is also the most consistent at delivering a solid dining experience. My muse was probably watching over, since it placed me within walking distance of Bouillon Bilk. . . Simple urban design, endless bar seating, low ceilings and dimmed lights set my mood right from the start. It's packed.  Always packed.  So do make reservations.  However - if you alone or do not mind eating at the bar, you can still score seat there. I asked sazerac as soon as I saw it on the list, but alas, it was not available that night, and my server (who was very helpful and nice, btw), recommended another drink of similar composition (name escapes me at the moment), which was incredibly well made. It's all started with perfect drink. . .  Followed by bread and butter. . .  Then, beautifully presented sweetbreads, veal tongue & celery root appetizer arrived.  My eyes lit up, and my taste buds started singing.  It was delicious.  But it was not over yet - my cleaned to the original shine plate disappeared magically, and in it place came main course - perfectly seared scallops, cauliflower, shiitake mushrooms & watercress.  I closed my eyes in joy and savored it piece by piece. . .  I was not planning on dessert (ok, that's a bold fat lie if you know me.  shhhh!), but I could not resist special that day - chocolate macaron, a scoop of ice cream & little cup of warmed wine, all together complimenting each other in taste pairing and in presentation. It was an amazing meal all together. For me, the class of Bouillon Bilk stands up there with Envy and Juni - with service, food and presentation being on the level that put it on the list of my forever favorites. FINALLY made it to Bouillon Bilk! It's been on my list for a very, very long time and the hype was definitely worth it.   First off, a 5:30pm reservation is definitely where it's at.  The restaurant opens exactly at 5:30 and you will be one of the first tables seated.  Within minutes, the rest of the place will be packed with all the other smart cookies who had the same plan as you.  That way you don't have to deal with too much of a backlog in the kitchen as you would if you were the second seating in the evening.  You even get the added bonus of dealing with extra-friendly staff at the beginning of service. In terms of decor, the crisp white tablecloths and the sparkling wine glasses are the first things you notice when you walk in the door.  In the middle of the dining room, the wooden bartop is attention-grabbing (Note to self: Ask to sit at the bar next time. . .  Just gorgeous!).  For service, the staff is VERY attentive and as another reviewer pointed out, they are absolute experts on the menu.  The waitress and chef were very accommodating for the dairy and nut allergies at our table.  Now, onto the foooooood: Lamb tartar - This was my first time trying lamb tartar and now I'm a big fan.  The combination of the smoky cabbage, crispy topping and some sort of stonefruit all on top of the lamb was just unreal.  Beef duo - Special of the night.  Grilled strip loin ("Melt-in-your-mouth") with braised beef cheeks (Super tender), veggies, mushroom and gnochhi (Original dish has butter, parmesan and sweet potato puree as well). Lobster cappelleti - Rich and indulgent, in the best way possible.  The mascarpone and cream filling was soooo savoury and satisfying.  Big chunks of lobster on top.  Crispy fried bits and some plainer green veggies on the side. . .  I was literally tasting perfection.  Chocolate ganache - With sour cream ice cream and lemon cream.  I was warned by previous reviews that dessert is not Bouillon Bilk's strong point.  I agree that it was average but there is nothing bad about the standard chocolate ganache.  To explain my four-star rating. . .  We both agreed (like other reviewers) that a five-star rating would be granted with slightly larger portion sizes.  Even after having three full courses, we were not that full.  Yes, the flavours, service and decor are top notch but just a little bit more food on their plates would be ideal!Very chic farm to table restaurant in Montreal has all the elements of a great restaurant.   Wine list was quite good with some reasonably priced gems.   Service was great and very attentive to all our requests (in English of course).   The highlights of the meal included the Hamachi appetizer, duck Margaret (two types of ducks) perfectly cooked, and the exceptional scallops.   If I lived here I would definitely go back!I really enjoyed my time here.  I loved the food.  Overall I would give it a 4. 5/5. We dropped in for our 8pm reservation.  The place was busy, there was a constant flow of people coming and going.  The host had this really awesome flower jacket, he was friendly and quick to offer to take our coats. Decor: Felt modern and elegant, with the white walls, which did make the place seem bigger.  However, there wasn't a lot of space between some of the tables.  Especially the single tables.  Would have liked just a bit more room to navigate.  They had a mix of different tables.  Higher wooden tables by the bar, and the shorter tables, with white table clothes in the main dining area.  Also some tables with booths. Service 3. 5/5There was a long wait between some of our appetizers and our main meal.  We didn't leave the restaurant until 2. 5 hours later.  They did forgot about 1 of our appetizers, so it was slow in coming out.  And then the main meal took a bit longer to come out.  Since there was a bigger group that put their order in before us.  They did apologize for the longer wait time, which was nice. Our server was great at describing every dish.  She was also very knowledgeable about the ingredients and the different wines that would pair well with our meal.  She was friendly and checked to make sure we had what we needed. Food 4. 5/5 Each and every dish was presented beautifully.  Truly works of art. Appetizer - Every appetizer we ordered was delicious. The sweetbreads were delicious and fried nice and soft.  This was my first time trying it and I really enjoyed it.  The veal tongue melted in your mouth.  It was soft and not chewy.  I loved the pear toffee reduction.  The toffee was unexpected, but add a nice sweet caramel taste.  The pear and toffee paired nicely with the sweetbreads and the tongue.  We order the special scallop amuse bouche twice because my boyfriend like it so much.  The scallops came with clementine and parsnip.  Scallops were fresh and succulent.  The sweetness of the scallops, were brought out by the clementine and lime juice.  The special appetizer of sashimi fluke was my favourite dish of the night.  I definitely had a wow moment after eating the dish.  It was that good.  This was accompanied by beets and plums.  That were sweet and delicious.  Fried capers were a lovely crunchy treat that added a crunchy texture to the dish.  Very pretty to look at.  MainVenison with hedgehog mushrooms.  Venison was very tender and delicious cooked perfectly.  The meat melted in your mouth.  The venison didn't have a gamey taste to it at all.  The inside was still pink and juicy.  This was served on a bed of quinoa with chestnuts and greens.   The chocolate coffee sauce brought the whole dish together.  I usually dislike chocolate in savoury dishes, but here the chocolate was light and not over powering.  My boyfriend ordered the sirloin steak with hedgehog mushrooms, snails and onions.  Steak was soft and pink in the centre.  You could truly taste the beef flavour coming through.  This was a good dish, but it was my least favourite dish of the night. We ordered the pear molasses cake with pear ginger, parsnip ice cream, to share.  I was truly blown away by the parsnip ice cream.  Who would think that this would make a nice ice cream flavour? It was really delicious and you could definitely taste the parsnip.  It was a nice way to finish the meal with something sweet but not overly sweet, which I find a lot of dessert can be.  It also wasn't too heavy, which was great especially after all the other food we ate. I would definitely come back to try their other dishes if I was in Montreal again. Found this restaurant on Eater's list of must eat restaurants in Montreal.  The restaurant is small w/ fine lines, white linen tables, and has a modern feel to it.  Street parking only.  The restaurant is a little tricky to find since there is no sign in front of the building itself, just the name on a semi hidden front entrance.  We totally missed the restaurant & walked 2 blocks too far until we realized we passed 1595.  Staff and service are both friendly.  There are 4 separate restrooms with a public sink area.  I definitely called the restaurant to make a reservation based on another yelper's recommendation.  Eating early definitely has its benefits.  We set the rsvp at 5:30 and sure enough the restaurant was packed by 6:30-7pm on a Monday evening.  For appetizers, we ordered:Cured mackerel w celery, green chickpeas, mint & rhubarb gelee (Amuse bouche of the day) - I didn't eat this dish bc I'm pregnant and it's "raw".  Hubby was thoroughly impressed & raved about this dish.  Steamed jumbo oyster w/ radish, pears & ginger fermented black bean broth (special of the day) - this oyster was packed a flavorful punch.  Everything worked so well together and the broth was magnificent. Pork shoulder tagliatelle - this dish was good, but we could of done without it.  Pasta was cooked perfectly and pork was tender.  The sour cream added a slight hint of "cheesy" tang that I didn't care for. Sweetbreads w/ veal tongue, celery root, shishito peppers & pineapple - WOW! This dish was amazing.  The sweetbreads were perfectly cooked & crispy, the veal tongue was tender & full of flavor, the celery root purée was silky smooth, the thinly shaved celery root was pickled just right and the char on the shishito peppers added a nice smokiness to the dish.  The little bits of caramelized pineapple added a nice amount of sweetness. For our entrees, we ordered: Halibut two ways w/ a broccoli purée & florets, shiitake mushrooms, potatoes, Muscat grapes & hazelnuts - the crispy halibut nugget was the best element of this dish.  The main halibut itself was delicate and tender, but had a slight fishy taste to it.  Not sure how fresh the quality of the fish was.   The grapes and onions added a little bit too much sweetness to the dish.  The shiitake mushrooms were bland and the broccoli florets were a little over cooked.  This dish was crying for acidity and a squeeze of lemon definitely helped.  Quail w/ quail egg, fava beans, potato, & parsnips (special of the evening) - OMG this dish was divine! Perfectly seasoned & cooked quail.  The quail was slightly crisp and the sauce that came w it was smooth and rich.  All of the elements were superb.  Overall, we would totally return to this restaurant bc everything was executed well and the flavor profiles of each dish was exceptional (except for minor issues w/ the tagliatelle and halibut).  The only thing I didn't like about this restaurant was the inflexibility of the chef/cooks not wanting to cook any proteins above medium rare.  For someone who is pregnant and careful with how her food is prepared, I would have appreciated it if the chef/cook was willing to cook the protein to at least medium/medium well so that there's less of a potential illness or harm to my unborn child.  For that reason, I had to go with the halibut dish which I wasn't that impressed with.  I definitely recommend this restaurant.  Some yelpers commented on how small the portions are, but if the server times out each course right, the dishes are actually filling.  If not, fill up on their complimentary bread and butter!Absolutely excellent.  I started with the New Orleans and negroni Blanc cocktails and both ere outstanding.  Then we moved onto the starters of himachi and the beet salad were both perfectly blended in terms of contrasting flavours.  T he scallops and the venison were both outstanding, it was hard to decide which was better.  The pumpkin cake dessert was also a highlight.  $230 for two people including tip!Our lunch at Bouillon Bilk is in a heated battle with our subsequent dinner at Liverpool House for best meal in Montreal.  Since I was soberer for the former, Bouillon Bilk gets a wink and a gun as the de facto winner.  Our larger party mostly hadn't arrived in Montreal yet, and as such, we took the opportunity to squeeze in a fancy pants lunch at nearby Bouillon Bilk. We arrived right as it opened, sans reservations, and were lucky to be seated.  Within 15 minutes, the dining room was packed with patrons on a Friday morning.  So I think we made a good choice. The menu, officially described as Canadian (New), was overtly French-influenced and not unlike the multitude of good "American (New)" places you find in major cities like Chicago or San Francisco.  Separating the wheat from the chaff is often difficult, but in Boullion Bilk's case, I feel comfortable designating it the former. Despite the weekend of indulgences awaiting us, we still went overboard with the lunch.  For starters, we went Kayne-style ham, getting oysters, foie, and tartare (tuna or hamachi, can't remember which).  All just fantastic, but at a French-inspired place, the foie better be a cut above, and it was. For mains, I had a hard time deciding between the octopus and the duck confit, two personal French favorites that are well worth the coin when cooked well.  I opted for the former while my compadre did the latter.  Again, both dishes were wholly excellent.  Overall, lunch at Bouillon Bilk was a great starter kit to a fun weekend. - BOTTOM LINE:By far the BEST BEST meal we had in Montreal (and this included Au Pied de Cochon). . . perhaps the best meal I've had in a few years.  Make reservations in advance.  The walk to Bouillon Bilk was not far from downtown and also close to a ton of great bars for post-dinner nightcaps. - THE SERVICE:We stumbled into Bouillon Bilk reservation-less and the French skills of an infant.  The hostess told us the wait would be two hours and we were disappointed but definitely not surprised.  Then, she smiled and said what the heck, and managed to squeeze us 4 in right then and there in a fantastic corner table.  THANK YOU for giving us the gift of this meal! I do not know your name, but you had a really cute blue shirt with artichokes on it.  The rest of the staff was awesome as well.  The menu was clearly explained to us and our cups remained happily filled with cocktails and water throughout the meal. - THE SPACE:Intimate but unpretentious.  Great for parents, dates, and old friends. - THE FOOD:Amazing.  Spectacular.  Our fois gras on toast, strawberries, and beets hit every note of texture and flavor imaginable.  Us four shared this appetizer and were all able to get ample bites of the fois gras.  The fruit and beets provided a refreshing break from the heaviness of the fois gras. I had the special of the day - veal 3 ways (veal cutlet, veal sweetbreads, and veal pastrami) and it was phenomenal.  What an experience.  The cutlet was perfectly cooked and medium rare, the sweetbreads crispy and juicy, and the pastrami perfectly salty and fatty.  I really appreciated how much they try to push the envelope but still keep their flavors true and homey.  My boyfriends sea bass had the crispiest skin ever.  I aspire to cook fish that well. Overall, an amazing experience at this place.  I'm so glad we managed to squeeze in here without a reservation. . . but I suggest you make one in advance! It was by the most memorable food experience we had in Montreal. This restaurant became, immediately, my new favorite restaurant in all of Montreal.  As a frequent visitor of the beautiful city, it wasn't until my most recent trip that I decided to give this place a visit.  The food here is absolute perfection.  Everyone at the table raved about the food.  Everything is prepared perfectly from presentation to taste to texture.  This place defines culinary execution.  I ordered the halibut and it tasted as if it were caught that day.   The cooking temperature ensured that the freshness of the fish hit me upon my first bite, at which time the flesh melts softly on the palate giving way to the sweet scent of the ocean.  That same consistency carries through the meal from the first bite to the last.  The perfect execution even carries to the vegetables and fingerling potatoes.  A million kudos the the chef.  The sommelier was able to offer the perfect selection to pair with our dishes.  All in all this made for the perfect dining experience. Before this meal, my favorite all time meal had been at Charlie Trotter's in Chicago.  That meal is now tied with the one I had at Bouillon Bilk.   Very interesting menu, creative flavor and texture combinations, amazing execution, beautiful presentation, and spectacular service.  The beet salad is transformative.  I also loved the lobster amuse-bouche, the scallops, the venison, the chocolate financier.  This is a very special dining experience.  Bravo!This was our favorite restaurant in Montreal. We arrived after hours of riding bikes.  We were casually dressed, sweaty, and covered in dust; however, the employees at Bouillon Bilk welcomed us just like the best dressed folks there.  We saw everybody at Bouillon Bilk.  There were beautifully dressed people in the restaurant as well as a casually dressed family. The restaurant itself is gorgeous.  The front windows let in lots of natural light.  The lines are straight and clean.  The elements were modern.  For example, the sink was outside of the bathroom and was long and communal.  It was really neat and surprising. And then the food.  M ordered the duck.  It was amazing.  She let me try some.  It was tender and melted in your mouth.  It melted and it mixed with the sauce and contrasted with the fresh greens.  It was a full song with harmony. I got the cucumber salad.  I love the freshness of cucumber and Bouillon Bilk took that characteristic and let it shine.  It was enhanced with a few radishes, some goat cheese and some crispy nuts.  It was crunchy, soft, and light. Next, we got three desserts: a cheese plate, strawberries, and chocolate.  Yum, yum, and YUM! When we first made our reservation, we were told that the table would need to be free by 8:00 PM.  As that time drew closer, and we were still enjoying our dessert, I asked our server.  He encouraged us to linger and submit to the pleasures before us. Our server also told us about our next favorite restaurant in Montreal: Hotel Herman.  We would have gone to Bouillon Bilk every evening if the menu was more extensive.  But that's some of the poetry of Bouillon Bilk.  It knows what it can do and it executes it will finesse. I love the name of this restaurant, WOO for alliteration.  Boullion Bilk - it's fun to say.  I find the name attractive as well as everything inside - environment and cuisine.  All appealing and cool and lovely.  The decor is extremely simple and clean.  Wooden floors, white walls, white tablecloths and napkins, big heavy wooden tables.  No crazy artwork or light fixtures, just simple textures and clean lines.  We started with the "Quebec Cheese Assortment" (5 cheeses for $20 or 3 for $15).  Of course we got 5, and they were each local and incredible.  I can't remember the exact names of each cheese, and I know they rotate depending on what's available, but they're five very different and beautiful options.  We ate every single bite, of course.  What's better than cheese?? I can't think of anything. For my entree, I ordered the scallop dish which comes with zucchini, shiitake mushrooms, pear, and watercress served in a brown butter.  Oh my stars, you guys.  These scallops were the most buttery, perfectly seared, velvety pieces of fish everrrr.  The brown butter was rich and fantastic and the pear provided a really interesting sweetness.  This particular dish was $31 which is a bit pricey considering the small portion.  It's enough food for one person surely, a healthy size, but I was craving a bit more in the end.  Wonderful wine menu here as well with some great local options. If you're in the mood for pretty plating and a business class type of atmosphere, Boullion Bilk is the perfect spot.  Service was down-to-earth and friendly, and despite my last minute booking we were able to nab a table for 3 on a Friday night.   Granted, we were only given a 10-minute window to actually get to the restaurant, but as we lived nearby anyway it wasn't too much of an issue.  With the goal to stuff myself silly with foie gras over the weekend, I started the meal with a foie gras appetizer.  A generous slab of deliciously seared foie, sitting on top of a slice of toasted brioche and prettily dotted by pureed raspberries and a beet reduction.  Apart from their regular menu were also a few daily special additions for the night (of which I unfortunately can't remember), but the scallops entree had caught my eye already anyway.   3 scallops in drool-inducing browned butter, the portion is a tad scanty but it makes me hungry just reminiscing about it.   My scallops were a tad bit overcooked - though far from the dreaded rubbery state, my inner bratty food snob says it could've used a literal *touch* less heat to retain more umami mouthfeel.   Hey, I did admit that it's quite bratty of me to point out such a minor detail - cause it was otherwise delicious.  The dessert, a rhubarb, strawberries and juniper dish with lime gremolata and little islands of buttermilk cream seemed to float in a translucent pinkish red pool, which turned out to be a very thin layer of set rhubarb gel.   Lovely dishes and all-around lovely place. There is a reason Buillon Bilk was named one of the restaurants to try in Montreal before you die.  This place is fabulous.  At first, the restaurant's exterior and interior decor is very plain.  You wouldn't expect this place to have it all.  But I came here not for the decor.  I came for the vibrant and decorative menu as well as the nightly specials.  Each dish from appetizers to dessert was thoroughly planned out with complimenting ingredients, bold colors and overwhelming flavors.  Calling the items I enjoyed fantastic was not enough.  I came here already full from the day's endless eating but had to make an attempt to sit down at Buillon Bilk on my last night in Montreal to try something.  I had the lobster appetizer and sea urchin linguini.  Both appetizers were drop dead fabulous! I can't imagine how numbing everything else on the menu could be.  I'm at a lost for words.  I could die happy.  Note to self: Come back to Montreal for more Buillon Bilk. This meal is right there with the best meals I've ever had.  The restaurant itself is small and trendy, and the hosts and waitstaff all very polite and knowledgable.  While the ambiance of the space and the attentiveness of our waiter definitely contributed to the experience, the real star of the night was the food. We started with cocktails and appetizers; the hamachi, and the sweetbreads with veal tongue.  The hamachi was served raw, and was paired with yuzu kosho, grapefruit, fennel, and cucumber.  Delicious, clean, and light.  The sweetbreads may have been the single best thing I had all night, and both they and the tongue were melt in your mouth tender.  For our entrees we had duck three ways (dumpling, breast, and heart), and halibut two ways (filet, and fried cheek).  All three variations of the duck were amazing.  The heart was meaty and tasty without being gamey, the breast was tender and paired perfectly with the cara cara orange, and the dumpling was good enough to be a dish of its own.  The fish was just as good, especially the cheek, which flaked apart as soon as the fork hit it.  We ended our meal with a pistachio financier served with black current, white chocolate, and basil.  Just sweet enough, and the perfect ending to a great meal.  The courteousness of the staff, the beautiful plating, and most importantly the flavor of the food make Bouillon Bilk a must try. This is a beautiful take on modern gourmet Canadian/North-American cuisine.  The restaurant itself is bare-walled and plain, and it's very a loud yet somehow intimate setting.  The waitstaff was a bit cold, but they were generally helpful with any questions we had with the menu. My friend ordered the rabbit and ravioli, and I ordered the halibut two ways (fried and sous-vide).  The portions here appear small, but they aren't ludicrously small.  After the bread and my entree, I was satisfied.  The halibut was excellent fried and even better sous-vide; I'd never had sous-vide before, but it was incredibly tender and moist. After the meal, we ordered the yogurt & mango & papaya dessert, and it was excellent.  Seriously the most creative and delicious dessert I've ever had.  Each component of the dessert blended together beautifully while being distinct flavors.  The contrast of texture was something that I've never seen executed so masterfully in a dessert.  You must order this dessert!Boy was our dinner at Buoillon Bilk the best meal we had in Montreal, maybe even one of the best dinners I've had, period!  We tried making a reservation the night before our actual dinner but it was completely booked.  Now I understand why!Firstly, the restaurant is beautiful, despite the confusing, yellow awning it stands under.   The interior is outrageously chic with plentiful seating and a cool bar area, where we dined.   Secondly, the staff is super friendly, in an unpretentious way.   Moreover, the food was AWESOME!  We ordered a dozen oysters to start with and to get our libidos going.   They were a mouthful, fresh and came with 3 sauces that one can do with or without.   For our entrees, we ordered the cod fish and scallops, both of which were gorgeously plated and delicious!!  My cod fish was so moist that it collapsed upon the stab of my fork (t'was a gentle stab).   The garnishments on the plate also paired very well with the fish.   The scallops were also perfectly seared with garnishments that complimented the shellfish very well.   We devoured every single last bit of our artistic entrees AND ordered the upside down peach cake with ice cream for dessert, which left us leaving the restaurant with nothing but satisfaction!Thank you Buoillon Bilk for a memorable meal that made our trip to Montreal that much more amazing!Great restaurant overall. Every single dish was impressive, rich and full of different flavors in great harmony. Service is outstanding, all simple details were just right. Loved everything.  We enjoyed a lovely evening. For our 1 year, my husband took me to a really fancy french restaurant called Bouillon Bilk , it took roughly 30 mins to walk there - this restaurant is located at a very sketch place.  There were construction everywhere and homeless tents were close to the area. . .  I seriously wonder why they decided to open a restaurant in this area?The food was superb though, the service is also fantastic.  The server pretty much memorized the menu, he told me about the special they were having $5 for 3 shrimps.  So I said why not! I should had known. . . . . .  tiny tiny tiny shrimps.  Picture below.  Well, I guess I kinda got 3 and a 1/2 shrimp.  He was being very generous.   I got the pasta.  Oh - it was delicious! I tried so so so hard to not just eat it all in one bite.  So I took little bites so my meal would last longer.  I am not meant to eat at a french cuisine. My husband had the short ribs Equally as good. The portion is wayyyyyyy too small for me.  I would have to order 5 plates to fill me up!Bouillon Bilk (BB) is one of the few places in Montreal that all my chef friends consistently recommend.  They pay attention to what these folks are doing.  I've been here for lunch or dinner well over 30 times the last few years (I often take work-related visitors for dinner here) and have never been disappointed.  Menu changes occur sufficiently often that it makes little sense to give details about the specific dishes I tried this time.  While some restaurants tend to be better at delivering certain types of dishes, I feel that BB is consistent - I don't remember ever having a dish that I didn't like and the highlights over time cannot be classified as a specific type. BB is also a very stylish spot and the service staff are helpful and extremely pleasant. This is one of my favorite food destinations in Montreal.  To reiterate: of my favorites, it is also the most consistent at delivering a solid dining experience.

FINALLY made it to Bouillon Bilk! It's been on my list for a very, very long time and the hype was definitely worth it.   First off, a 5:30pm reservation is definitely where it's at.  The restaurant opens exactly at 5:30 and you will be one of the first tables seated.  Within minutes, the rest of the place will be packed with all the other smart cookies who had the same plan as you.  That way you don't have to deal with too much of a backlog in the kitchen as you would if you were the second seating in the evening.

I loved the food.  Overall I would give it a 4. 5/5. We dropped in for our 8pm reservation.  The place was busy, there was a constant flow of people coming and going.  The host had this really awesome flower jacket, he was friendly and quick to offer to take our coats. Decor: Felt modern and elegant, with the white walls, which did make the place seem bigger.  However, there wasn't a lot of space between some of the tables.  Especially the single tables.  Would have liked just a bit more room to navigate.  They had a mix of different tables.  Higher wooden tables by the bar, and the shorter tables, with white table clothes in the main dining area.  Also some tables with booths. Service 3. 5/5There was a long wait between some of our appetizers and our main meal.  We didn't leave the restaurant until 2. 5 hours later.  They did forgot about 1 of our appetizers, so it was slow in coming out.  And then the main meal took a bit longer to come out.  Since there was a bigger group that put their order in before us.  They did apologize for the longer wait time, which was nice. Our server was great at describing every dish.  She was also very knowledgeable about the ingredients and the different wines that would pair well with our meal.  She was friendly and checked to make sure we had what we needed. Food 4. 5/5 Each and every dish was presented beautifully.  Truly works of art. Appetizer - Every appetizer we ordered was delicious. The sweetbreads were delicious and fried nice and soft.  This was my first time trying it and I really enjoyed it.  The veal tongue melted in your mouth.  It was soft and not chewy.  I loved the pear toffee reduction.  The toffee was unexpected, but add a nice sweet caramel taste.  The pear and toffee paired nicely with the sweetbreads and the tongue.  We order the special scallop amuse bouche twice because my boyfriend like it so much.  The scallops came with clementine and parsnip.  Scallops were fresh and succulent.  The sweetness of the scallops, were brought out by the clementine and lime juice.  The special appetizer of sashimi fluke was my favourite dish of the night.  I definitely had a wow moment after eating the dish.  It was that good.  This was accompanied by beets and plums.  That were sweet and delicious.  Fried capers were a lovely crunchy treat that added a crunchy texture to the dish.  Very pretty to look at.  MainVenison with hedgehog mushrooms.  Venison was very tender and delicious cooked perfectly.  The meat melted in your mouth.  The venison didn't have a gamey taste to it at all.  The inside was still pink and juicy.  This was served on a bed of quinoa with chestnuts and greens.   The chocolate coffee sauce brought the whole dish together.  I usually dislike chocolate in savoury dishes, but here the chocolate was light and not over powering.  My boyfriend ordered the sirloin steak with hedgehog mushrooms, snails and onions.  Steak was soft and pink in the centre.  You could truly taste the beef flavour coming through.  This was a good dish, but it was my least favourite dish of the night. We ordered the pear molasses cake with pear ginger, parsnip ice cream, to share.  I was truly blown away by the parsnip ice cream.  Who would think that this would make a nice ice cream flavour? It was really delicious and you could definitely taste the parsnip.  It was a nice way to finish the meal with something sweet but not overly sweet, which I find a lot of dessert can be.  It also wasn't too heavy, which was great especially after all the other food we ate. I would definitely come back to try their other dishes if I was in Montreal again. Found this restaurant on Eater's list of must eat restaurants in Montreal.  The restaurant is small w/ fine lines, white linen tables, and has a modern feel to it.  Street parking only.  The restaurant is a little tricky to find since there is no sign in front of the building itself, just the name on a semi hidden front entrance.  We totally missed the restaurant & walked 2 blocks too far until we realized we passed 1595.  Staff and service are both friendly.  There are 4 separate restrooms with a public sink area.  I definitely called the restaurant to make a reservation based on another yelper's recommendation.  Eating early definitely has its benefits.  We set the rsvp at 5:30 and sure enough the restaurant was packed by 6:30-7pm on a Monday evening.  For appetizers, we ordered:Cured mackerel w celery, green chickpeas, mint & rhubarb gelee (Amuse bouche of the day) - I didn't eat this dish bc I'm pregnant and it's "raw".  Hubby was thoroughly impressed & raved about this dish.  Steamed jumbo oyster w/ radish, pears & ginger fermented black bean broth (special of the day) - this oyster was packed a flavorful punch.  Everything worked so well together and the broth was magnificent. Pork shoulder tagliatelle - this dish was good, but we could of done without it.  Pasta was cooked perfectly and pork was tender.  The sour cream added a slight hint of "cheesy" tang that I didn't care for. Sweetbreads w/ veal tongue, celery root, shishito peppers & pineapple - WOW! This dish was amazing.  The sweetbreads were perfectly cooked & crispy, the veal tongue was tender & full of flavor, the celery root purée was silky smooth, the thinly shaved celery root was pickled just right and the char on the shishito peppers added a nice smokiness to the dish.  The little bits of caramelized pineapple added a nice amount of sweetness. For our entrees, we ordered: Halibut two ways w/ a broccoli purée & florets, shiitake mushrooms, potatoes, Muscat grapes & hazelnuts - the crispy halibut nugget was the best element of this dish.  The main halibut itself was delicate and tender, but had a slight fishy taste to it.  Not sure how fresh the quality of the fish was.   The grapes and onions added a little bit too much sweetness to the dish.  The shiitake mushrooms were bland and the broccoli florets were a little over cooked.  This dish was crying for acidity and a squeeze of lemon definitely helped.  Quail w/ quail egg, fava beans, potato, & parsnips (special of the evening) - OMG this dish was divine! Perfectly seasoned & cooked quail.  The quail was slightly crisp and the sauce that came w it was smooth and rich.  All of the elements were superb.  Overall, we would totally return to this restaurant bc everything was executed well and the flavor profiles of each dish was exceptional (except for minor issues w/ the tagliatelle and halibut).  The only thing I didn't like about this restaurant was the inflexibility of the chef/cooks not wanting to cook any proteins above medium rare.  For someone who is pregnant and careful with how her food is prepared, I would have appreciated it if the chef/cook was willing to cook the protein to at least medium/medium well so that there's less of a potential illness or harm to my unborn child.  For that reason, I had to go with the halibut dish which I wasn't that impressed with.  I definitely recommend this restaurant.  Some yelpers commented on how small the portions are, but if the server times out each course right, the dishes are actually filling.  If not, fill up on their complimentary bread and butter!Absolutely excellent.  I started with the New Orleans and negroni Blanc cocktails and both ere outstanding.  Then we moved onto the starters of himachi and the beet salad were both perfectly blended in terms of contrasting flavours.  T he scallops and the venison were both outstanding, it was hard to decide which was better.  The pumpkin cake dessert was also a highlight.  $230 for two people including tip!Our lunch at Bouillon Bilk is in a heated battle with our subsequent dinner at Liverpool House for best meal in Montreal.  Since I was soberer for the former, Bouillon Bilk gets a wink and a gun as the de facto winner.  Our larger party mostly hadn't arrived in Montreal yet, and as such, we took the opportunity to squeeze in a fancy pants lunch at nearby Bouillon Bilk. We arrived right as it opened, sans reservations, and were lucky to be seated.  Within 15 minutes, the dining room was packed with patrons on a Friday morning.  So I think we made a good choice. The menu, officially described as Canadian (New), was overtly French-influenced and not unlike the multitude of good "American (New)" places you find in major cities like Chicago or San Francisco.  Separating the wheat from the chaff is often difficult, but in Boullion Bilk's case, I feel comfortable designating it the former. Despite the weekend of indulgences awaiting us, we still went overboard with the lunch.  For starters, we went Kayne-style ham, getting oysters, foie, and tartare (tuna or hamachi, can't remember which).  All just fantastic, but at a French-inspired place, the foie better be a cut above, and it was. For mains, I had a hard time deciding between the octopus and the duck confit, two personal French favorites that are well worth the coin when cooked well.  I opted for the former while my compadre did the latter.  Again, both dishes were wholly excellent.  Overall, lunch at Bouillon Bilk was a great starter kit to a fun weekend. - BOTTOM LINE:By far the BEST BEST meal we had in Montreal (and this included Au Pied de Cochon). . . perhaps the best meal I've had in a few years.  Make reservations in advance.  The walk to Bouillon Bilk was not far from downtown and also close to a ton of great bars for post-dinner nightcaps. - THE SERVICE:We stumbled into Bouillon Bilk reservation-less and the French skills of an infant.  The hostess told us the wait would be two hours and we were disappointed but definitely not surprised.  Then, she smiled and said what the heck, and managed to squeeze us 4 in right then and there in a fantastic corner table.  THANK YOU for giving us the gift of this meal! I do not know your name, but you had a really cute blue shirt with artichokes on it.  The rest of the staff was awesome as well.  The menu was clearly explained to us and our cups remained happily filled with cocktails and water throughout the meal. - THE SPACE:Intimate but unpretentious.  Great for parents, dates, and old friends. - THE FOOD:Amazing.  Spectacular.  Our fois gras on toast, strawberries, and beets hit every note of texture and flavor imaginable.  Us four shared this appetizer and were all able to get ample bites of the fois gras.  The fruit and beets provided a refreshing break from the heaviness of the fois gras. I had the special of the day - veal 3 ways (veal cutlet, veal sweetbreads, and veal pastrami) and it was phenomenal.  What an experience.  The cutlet was perfectly cooked and medium rare, the sweetbreads crispy and juicy, and the pastrami perfectly salty and fatty.  I really appreciated how much they try to push the envelope but still keep their flavors true and homey.  My boyfriends sea bass had the crispiest skin ever.  I aspire to cook fish that well. Overall, an amazing experience at this place.  I'm so glad we managed to squeeze in here without a reservation. . . but I suggest you make one in advance! It was by the most memorable food experience we had in Montreal. This restaurant became, immediately, my new favorite restaurant in all of Montreal.  As a frequent visitor of the beautiful city, it wasn't until my most recent trip that I decided to give this place a visit.  The food here is absolute perfection.  Everyone at the table raved about the food.  Everything is prepared perfectly from presentation to taste to texture.  This place defines culinary execution.  I ordered the halibut and it tasted as if it were caught that day.   The cooking temperature ensured that the freshness of the fish hit me upon my first bite, at which time the flesh melts softly on the palate giving way to the sweet scent of the ocean.  That same consistency carries through the meal from the first bite to the last.  The perfect execution even carries to the vegetables and fingerling potatoes.  A million kudos the the chef.  The sommelier was able to offer the perfect selection to pair with our dishes.  All in all this made for the perfect dining experience. Before this meal, my favorite all time meal had been at Charlie Trotter's in Chicago.  That meal is now tied with the one I had at Bouillon Bilk.   Very interesting menu, creative flavor and texture combinations, amazing execution, beautiful presentation, and spectacular service.  The beet salad is transformative.  I also loved the lobster amuse-bouche, the scallops, the venison, the chocolate financier.  This is a very special dining experience.  Bravo!This was our favorite restaurant in Montreal. We arrived after hours of riding bikes.  We were casually dressed, sweaty, and covered in dust; however, the employees at Bouillon Bilk welcomed us just like the best dressed folks there.  We saw everybody at Bouillon Bilk.  There were beautifully dressed people in the restaurant as well as a casually dressed family. The restaurant itself is gorgeous.  The front windows let in lots of natural light.  The lines are straight and clean.  The elements were modern.  For example, the sink was outside of the bathroom and was long and communal.  It was really neat and surprising. And then the food.  M ordered the duck.  It was amazing.  She let me try some.  It was tender and melted in your mouth.  It melted and it mixed with the sauce and contrasted with the fresh greens.  It was a full song with harmony. I got the cucumber salad.  I love the freshness of cucumber and Bouillon Bilk took that characteristic and let it shine.  It was enhanced with a few radishes, some goat cheese and some crispy nuts.  It was crunchy, soft, and light. Next, we got three desserts: a cheese plate, strawberries, and chocolate.  Yum, yum, and YUM! When we first made our reservation, we were told that the table would need to be free by 8:00 PM.  As that time drew closer, and we were still enjoying our dessert, I asked our server.  He encouraged us to linger and submit to the pleasures before us. Our server also told us about our next favorite restaurant in Montreal: Hotel Herman.  We would have gone to Bouillon Bilk every evening if the menu was more extensive.  But that's some of the poetry of Bouillon Bilk.  It knows what it can do and it executes it will finesse. I love the name of this restaurant, WOO for alliteration.  Boullion Bilk - it's fun to say.  I find the name attractive as well as everything inside - environment and cuisine.  All appealing and cool and lovely.  The decor is extremely simple and clean.  Wooden floors, white walls, white tablecloths and napkins, big heavy wooden tables.  No crazy artwork or light fixtures, just simple textures and clean lines.  We started with the "Quebec Cheese Assortment" (5 cheeses for $20 or 3 for $15).  Of course we got 5, and they were each local and incredible.  I can't remember the exact names of each cheese, and I know they rotate depending on what's available, but they're five very different and beautiful options.  We ate every single bite, of course.  What's better than cheese?? I can't think of anything. For my entree, I ordered the scallop dish which comes with zucchini, shiitake mushrooms, pear, and watercress served in a brown butter.  Oh my stars, you guys.  These scallops were the most buttery, perfectly seared, velvety pieces of fish everrrr.  The brown butter was rich and fantastic and the pear provided a really interesting sweetness.  This particular dish was $31 which is a bit pricey considering the small portion.  It's enough food for one person surely, a healthy size, but I was craving a bit more in the end.  Wonderful wine menu here as well with some great local options. If you're in the mood for pretty plating and a business class type of atmosphere, Boullion Bilk is the perfect spot.  Service was down-to-earth and friendly, and despite my last minute booking we were able to nab a table for 3 on a Friday night.   Granted, we were only given a 10-minute window to actually get to the restaurant, but as we lived nearby anyway it wasn't too much of an issue.  With the goal to stuff myself silly with foie gras over the weekend, I started the meal with a foie gras appetizer.  A generous slab of deliciously seared foie, sitting on top of a slice of toasted brioche and prettily dotted by pureed raspberries and a beet reduction.  Apart from their regular menu were also a few daily special additions for the night (of which I unfortunately can't remember), but the scallops entree had caught my eye already anyway.   3 scallops in drool-inducing browned butter, the portion is a tad scanty but it makes me hungry just reminiscing about it.   My scallops were a tad bit overcooked - though far from the dreaded rubbery state, my inner bratty food snob says it could've used a literal *touch* less heat to retain more umami mouthfeel.   Hey, I did admit that it's quite bratty of me to point out such a minor detail - cause it was otherwise delicious.  The dessert, a rhubarb, strawberries and juniper dish with lime gremolata and little islands of buttermilk cream seemed to float in a translucent pinkish red pool, which turned out to be a very thin layer of set rhubarb gel.   Lovely dishes and all-around lovely place. There is a reason Buillon Bilk was named one of the restaurants to try in Montreal before you die.  This place is fabulous.  At first, the restaurant's exterior and interior decor is very plain.  You wouldn't expect this place to have it all.  But I came here not for the decor.  I came for the vibrant and decorative menu as well as the nightly specials.  Each dish from appetizers to dessert was thoroughly planned out with complimenting ingredients, bold colors and overwhelming flavors.  Calling the items I enjoyed fantastic was not enough.  I came here already full from the day's endless eating but had to make an attempt to sit down at Buillon Bilk on my last night in Montreal to try something.  I had the lobster appetizer and sea urchin linguini.  Both appetizers were drop dead fabulous! I can't imagine how numbing everything else on the menu could be.  I'm at a lost for words.  I could die happy.  Note to self: Come back to Montreal for more Buillon Bilk. This meal is right there with the best meals I've ever had.  The restaurant itself is small and trendy, and the hosts and waitstaff all very polite and knowledgable.  While the ambiance of the space and the attentiveness of our waiter definitely contributed to the experience, the real star of the night was the food. We started with cocktails and appetizers; the hamachi, and the sweetbreads with veal tongue.  The hamachi was served raw, and was paired with yuzu kosho, grapefruit, fennel, and cucumber.  Delicious, clean, and light.  The sweetbreads may have been the single best thing I had all night, and both they and the tongue were melt in your mouth tender.  For our entrees we had duck three ways (dumpling, breast, and heart), and halibut two ways (filet, and fried cheek).  All three variations of the duck were amazing.  The heart was meaty and tasty without being gamey, the breast was tender and paired perfectly with the cara cara orange, and the dumpling was good enough to be a dish of its own.  The fish was just as good, especially the cheek, which flaked apart as soon as the fork hit it.  We ended our meal with a pistachio financier served with black current, white chocolate, and basil.  Just sweet enough, and the perfect ending to a great meal.  The courteousness of the staff, the beautiful plating, and most importantly the flavor of the food make Bouillon Bilk a must try. This is a beautiful take on modern gourmet Canadian/North-American cuisine.  The restaurant itself is bare-walled and plain, and it's very a loud yet somehow intimate setting.  The waitstaff was a bit cold, but they were generally helpful with any questions we had with the menu. My friend ordered the rabbit and ravioli, and I ordered the halibut two ways (fried and sous-vide).  The portions here appear small, but they aren't ludicrously small.  After the bread and my entree, I was satisfied.  The halibut was excellent fried and even better sous-vide; I'd never had sous-vide before, but it was incredibly tender and moist. After the meal, we ordered the yogurt & mango & papaya dessert, and it was excellent.  Seriously the most creative and delicious dessert I've ever had.  Each component of the dessert blended together beautifully while being distinct flavors.  The contrast of texture was something that I've never seen executed so masterfully in a dessert.  You must order this dessert!Boy was our dinner at Buoillon Bilk the best meal we had in Montreal, maybe even one of the best dinners I've had, period!  We tried making a reservation the night before our actual dinner but it was completely booked.  Now I understand why!Firstly, the restaurant is beautiful, despite the confusing, yellow awning it stands under.   The interior is outrageously chic with plentiful seating and a cool bar area, where we dined.   Secondly, the staff is super friendly, in an unpretentious way.   Moreover, the food was AWESOME!  We ordered a dozen oysters to start with and to get our libidos going.   They were a mouthful, fresh and came with 3 sauces that one can do with or without.   For our entrees, we ordered the cod fish and scallops, both of which were gorgeously plated and delicious!!  My cod fish was so moist that it collapsed upon the stab of my fork (t'was a gentle stab).   The garnishments on the plate also paired very well with the fish.   The scallops were also perfectly seared with garnishments that complimented the shellfish very well.   We devoured every single last bit of our artistic entrees AND ordered the upside down peach cake with ice cream for dessert, which left us leaving the restaurant with nothing but satisfaction!Thank you Buoillon Bilk for a memorable meal that made our trip to Montreal that much more amazing!Great restaurant overall. Every single dish was impressive, rich and full of different flavors in great harmony. Service is outstanding, all simple details were just right. Loved everything.  We enjoyed a lovely evening. For our 1 year, my husband took me to a really fancy french restaurant called Bouillon Bilk , it took roughly 30 mins to walk there - this restaurant is located at a very sketch place.  There were construction everywhere and homeless tents were close to the area. . .  I seriously wonder why they decided to open a restaurant in this area?The food was superb though, the service is also fantastic.  The server pretty much memorized the menu, he told me about the special they were having $5 for 3 shrimps.  So I said why not! I should had known. . . . . .  tiny tiny tiny shrimps.  Picture below.  Well, I guess I kinda got 3 and a 1/2 shrimp.  He was being very generous.   I got the pasta.  Oh - it was delicious! I tried so so so hard to not just eat it all in one bite.  So I took little bites so my meal would last longer.  I am not meant to eat at a french cuisine. My husband had the short ribs Equally as good. The portion is wayyyyyyy too small for me.  I would have to order 5 plates to fill me up!Bouillon Bilk (BB) is one of the few places in Montreal that all my chef friends consistently recommend.  They pay attention to what these folks are doing.  I've been here for lunch or dinner well over 30 times the last few years (I often take work-related visitors for dinner here) and have never been disappointed.  Menu changes occur sufficiently often that it makes little sense to give details about the specific dishes I tried this time.  While some restaurants tend to be better at delivering certain types of dishes, I feel that BB is consistent - I don't remember ever having a dish that I didn't like and the highlights over time cannot be classified as a specific type. BB is also a very stylish spot and the service staff are helpful and extremely pleasant. This is one of my favorite food destinations in Montreal.  To reiterate: of my favorites, it is also the most consistent at delivering a solid dining experience. My muse was probably watching over, since it placed me within walking distance of Bouillon Bilk. . . Simple urban design, endless bar seating, low ceilings and dimmed lights set my mood right from the start. It's packed.  Always packed.  So do make reservations.  However - if you alone or do not mind eating at the bar, you can still score seat there. I asked sazerac as soon as I saw it on the list, but alas, it was not available that night, and my server (who was very helpful and nice, btw), recommended another drink of similar composition (name escapes me at the moment), which was incredibly well made. It's all started with perfect drink. . .  Followed by bread and butter. . .  Then, beautifully presented sweetbreads, veal tongue & celery root appetizer arrived.  My eyes lit up, and my taste buds started singing.  It was delicious.  But it was not over yet - my cleaned to the original shine plate disappeared magically, and in it place came main course - perfectly seared scallops, cauliflower, shiitake mushrooms & watercress.  I closed my eyes in joy and savored it piece by piece. . .  I was not planning on dessert (ok, that's a bold fat lie if you know me.  shhhh!), but I could not resist special that day - chocolate macaron, a scoop of ice cream & little cup of warmed wine, all together complimenting each other in taste pairing and in presentation. It was an amazing meal all together. For me, the class of Bouillon Bilk stands up there with Envy and Juni - with service, food and presentation being on the level that put it on the list of my forever favorites. FINALLY made it to Bouillon Bilk! It's been on my list for a very, very long time and the hype was definitely worth it.   First off, a 5:30pm reservation is definitely where it's at.  The restaurant opens exactly at 5:30 and you will be one of the first tables seated.  Within minutes, the rest of the place will be packed with all the other smart cookies who had the same plan as you.  That way you don't have to deal with too much of a backlog in the kitchen as you would if you were the second seating in the evening.  You even get the added bonus of dealing with extra-friendly staff at the beginning of service. In terms of decor, the crisp white tablecloths and the sparkling wine glasses are the first things you notice when you walk in the door.  In the middle of the dining room, the wooden bartop is attention-grabbing (Note to self: Ask to sit at the bar next time. . .  Just gorgeous!).  For service, the staff is VERY attentive and as another reviewer pointed out, they are absolute experts on the menu.  The waitress and chef were very accommodating for the dairy and nut allergies at our table.  Now, onto the foooooood: Lamb tartar - This was my first time trying lamb tartar and now I'm a big fan.  The combination of the smoky cabbage, crispy topping and some sort of stonefruit all on top of the lamb was just unreal.  Beef duo - Special of the night.  Grilled strip loin ("Melt-in-your-mouth") with braised beef cheeks (Super tender), veggies, mushroom and gnochhi (Original dish has butter, parmesan and sweet potato puree as well). Lobster cappelleti - Rich and indulgent, in the best way possible.  The mascarpone and cream filling was soooo savoury and satisfying.  Big chunks of lobster on top.  Crispy fried bits and some plainer green veggies on the side. . .  I was literally tasting perfection.  Chocolate ganache - With sour cream ice cream and lemon cream.  I was warned by previous reviews that dessert is not Bouillon Bilk's strong point.  I agree that it was average but there is nothing bad about the standard chocolate ganache.  To explain my four-star rating. . .  We both agreed (like other reviewers) that a five-star rating would be granted with slightly larger portion sizes.  Even after having three full courses, we were not that full.  Yes, the flavours, service and decor are top notch but just a little bit more food on their plates would be ideal!Very chic farm to table restaurant in Montreal has all the elements of a great restaurant.   Wine list was quite good with some reasonably priced gems.   Service was great and very attentive to all our requests (in English of course).   The highlights of the meal included the Hamachi appetizer, duck Margaret (two types of ducks) perfectly cooked, and the exceptional scallops.   If I lived here I would definitely go back!I really enjoyed my time here.  I loved the food.  Overall I would give it a 4. 5/5. We dropped in for our 8pm reservation.  The place was busy, there was a constant flow of people coming and going.  The host had this really awesome flower jacket, he was friendly and quick to offer to take our coats. Decor: Felt modern and elegant, with the white walls, which did make the place seem bigger.  However, there wasn't a lot of space between some of the tables.  Especially the single tables.  Would have liked just a bit more room to navigate.  They had a mix of different tables.  Higher wooden tables by the bar, and the shorter tables, with white table clothes in the main dining area.  Also some tables with booths. Service 3. 5/5There was a long wait between some of our appetizers and our main meal.  We didn't leave the restaurant until 2. 5 hours later.  They did forgot about 1 of our appetizers, so it was slow in coming out.  And then the main meal took a bit longer to come out.  Since there was a bigger group that put their order in before us.  They did apologize for the longer wait time, which was nice. Our server was great at describing every dish.  She was also very knowledgeable about the ingredients and the different wines that would pair well with our meal.  She was friendly and checked to make sure we had what we needed. Food 4. 5/5 Each and every dish was presented beautifully.  Truly works of art. Appetizer - Every appetizer we ordered was delicious. The sweetbreads were delicious and fried nice and soft.  This was my first time trying it and I really enjoyed it.  The veal tongue melted in your mouth.  It was soft and not chewy.  I loved the pear toffee reduction.  The toffee was unexpected, but add a nice sweet caramel taste.  The pear and toffee paired nicely with the sweetbreads and the tongue.  We order the special scallop amuse bouche twice because my boyfriend like it so much.  The scallops came with clementine and parsnip.  Scallops were fresh and succulent.  The sweetness of the scallops, were brought out by the clementine and lime juice.  The special appetizer of sashimi fluke was my favourite dish of the night.  I definitely had a wow moment after eating the dish.  It was that good.  This was accompanied by beets and plums.  That were sweet and delicious.  Fried capers were a lovely crunchy treat that added a crunchy texture to the dish.  Very pretty to look at.  MainVenison with hedgehog mushrooms.  Venison was very tender and delicious cooked perfectly.  The meat melted in your mouth.  The venison didn't have a gamey taste to it at all.  The inside was still pink and juicy.  This was served on a bed of quinoa with chestnuts and greens.   The chocolate coffee sauce brought the whole dish together.  I usually dislike chocolate in savoury dishes, but here the chocolate was light and not over powering.  My boyfriend ordered the sirloin steak with hedgehog mushrooms, snails and onions.  Steak was soft and pink in the centre.  You could truly taste the beef flavour coming through.  This was a good dish, but it was my least favourite dish of the night. We ordered the pear molasses cake with pear ginger, parsnip ice cream, to share.  I was truly blown away by the parsnip ice cream.  Who would think that this would make a nice ice cream flavour? It was really delicious and you could definitely taste the parsnip.  It was a nice way to finish the meal with something sweet but not overly sweet, which I find a lot of dessert can be.  It also wasn't too heavy, which was great especially after all the other food we ate. I would definitely come back to try their other dishes if I was in Montreal again. Found this restaurant on Eater's list of must eat restaurants in Montreal.  The restaurant is small w/ fine lines, white linen tables, and has a modern feel to it.  Street parking only.  The restaurant is a little tricky to find since there is no sign in front of the building itself, just the name on a semi hidden front entrance.  We totally missed the restaurant & walked 2 blocks too far until we realized we passed 1595.  Staff and service are both friendly.  There are 4 separate restrooms with a public sink area.  I definitely called the restaurant to make a reservation based on another yelper's recommendation.  Eating early definitely has its benefits.  We set the rsvp at 5:30 and sure enough the restaurant was packed by 6:30-7pm on a Monday evening.  For appetizers, we ordered:Cured mackerel w celery, green chickpeas, mint & rhubarb gelee (Amuse bouche of the day) - I didn't eat this dish bc I'm pregnant and it's "raw".  Hubby was thoroughly impressed & raved about this dish.  Steamed jumbo oyster w/ radish, pears & ginger fermented black bean broth (special of the day) - this oyster was packed a flavorful punch.  Everything worked so well together and the broth was magnificent. Pork shoulder tagliatelle - this dish was good, but we could of done without it.  Pasta was cooked perfectly and pork was tender.  The sour cream added a slight hint of "cheesy" tang that I didn't care for. Sweetbreads w/ veal tongue, celery root, shishito peppers & pineapple - WOW! This dish was amazing.  The sweetbreads were perfectly cooked & crispy, the veal tongue was tender & full of flavor, the celery root purée was silky smooth, the thinly shaved celery root was pickled just right and the char on the shishito peppers added a nice smokiness to the dish.  The little bits of caramelized pineapple added a nice amount of sweetness. For our entrees, we ordered: Halibut two ways w/ a broccoli purée & florets, shiitake mushrooms, potatoes, Muscat grapes & hazelnuts - the crispy halibut nugget was the best element of this dish.  The main halibut itself was delicate and tender, but had a slight fishy taste to it.  Not sure how fresh the quality of the fish was.   The grapes and onions added a little bit too much sweetness to the dish.  The shiitake mushrooms were bland and the broccoli florets were a little over cooked.  This dish was crying for acidity and a squeeze of lemon definitely helped.  Quail w/ quail egg, fava beans, potato, & parsnips (special of the evening) - OMG this dish was divine! Perfectly seasoned & cooked quail.  The quail was slightly crisp and the sauce that came w it was smooth and rich.  All of the elements were superb.  Overall, we would totally return to this restaurant bc everything was executed well and the flavor profiles of each dish was exceptional (except for minor issues w/ the tagliatelle and halibut).  The only thing I didn't like about this restaurant was the inflexibility of the chef/cooks not wanting to cook any proteins above medium rare.  For someone who is pregnant and careful with how her food is prepared, I would have appreciated it if the chef/cook was willing to cook the protein to at least medium/medium well so that there's less of a potential illness or harm to my unborn child.  For that reason, I had to go with the halibut dish which I wasn't that impressed with.  I definitely recommend this restaurant.  Some yelpers commented on how small the portions are, but if the server times out each course right, the dishes are actually filling.  If not, fill up on their complimentary bread and butter!Absolutely excellent.  I started with the New Orleans and negroni Blanc cocktails and both ere outstanding.  Then we moved onto the starters of himachi and the beet salad were both perfectly blended in terms of contrasting flavours.  T he scallops and the venison were both outstanding, it was hard to decide which was better.  The pumpkin cake dessert was also a highlight.  $230 for two people including tip!Our lunch at Bouillon Bilk is in a heated battle with our subsequent dinner at Liverpool House for best meal in Montreal.  Since I was soberer for the former, Bouillon Bilk gets a wink and a gun as the de facto winner.  Our larger party mostly hadn't arrived in Montreal yet, and as such, we took the opportunity to squeeze in a fancy pants lunch at nearby Bouillon Bilk. We arrived right as it opened, sans reservations, and were lucky to be seated.  Within 15 minutes, the dining room was packed with patrons on a Friday morning.  So I think we made a good choice. The menu, officially described as Canadian (New), was overtly French-influenced and not unlike the multitude of good "American (New)" places you find in major cities like Chicago or San Francisco.  Separating the wheat from the chaff is often difficult, but in Boullion Bilk's case, I feel comfortable designating it the former. Despite the weekend of indulgences awaiting us, we still went overboard with the lunch.  For starters, we went Kayne-style ham, getting oysters, foie, and tartare (tuna or hamachi, can't remember which).  All just fantastic, but at a French-inspired place, the foie better be a cut above, and it was. For mains, I had a hard time deciding between the octopus and the duck confit, two personal French favorites that are well worth the coin when cooked well.  I opted for the former while my compadre did the latter.  Again, both dishes were wholly excellent.  Overall, lunch at Bouillon Bilk was a great starter kit to a fun weekend. - BOTTOM LINE:By far the BEST BEST meal we had in Montreal (and this included Au Pied de Cochon). . . perhaps the best meal I've had in a few years.  Make reservations in advance.  The walk to Bouillon Bilk was not far from downtown and also close to a ton of great bars for post-dinner nightcaps. - THE SERVICE:We stumbled into Bouillon Bilk reservation-less and the French skills of an infant.  The hostess told us the wait would be two hours and we were disappointed but definitely not surprised.  Then, she smiled and said what the heck, and managed to squeeze us 4 in right then and there in a fantastic corner table.  THANK YOU for giving us the gift of this meal! I do not know your name, but you had a really cute blue shirt with artichokes on it.  The rest of the staff was awesome as well.  The menu was clearly explained to us and our cups remained happily filled with cocktails and water throughout the meal. - THE SPACE:Intimate but unpretentious.  Great for parents, dates, and old friends. - THE FOOD:Amazing.  Spectacular.  Our fois gras on toast, strawberries, and beets hit every note of texture and flavor imaginable.  Us four shared this appetizer and were all able to get ample bites of the fois gras.  The fruit and beets provided a refreshing break from the heaviness of the fois gras. I had the special of the day - veal 3 ways (veal cutlet, veal sweetbreads, and veal pastrami) and it was phenomenal.  What an experience.  The cutlet was perfectly cooked and medium rare, the sweetbreads crispy and juicy, and the pastrami perfectly salty and fatty.  I really appreciated how much they try to push the envelope but still keep their flavors true and homey.  My boyfriends sea bass had the crispiest skin ever.  I aspire to cook fish that well. Overall, an amazing experience at this place.  I'm so glad we managed to squeeze in here without a reservation. . . but I suggest you make one in advance! It was by the most memorable food experience we had in Montreal. This restaurant became, immediately, my new favorite restaurant in all of Montreal.  As a frequent visitor of the beautiful city, it wasn't until my most recent trip that I decided to give this place a visit.  The food here is absolute perfection.  Everyone at the table raved about the food.  Everything is prepared perfectly from presentation to taste to texture.  This place defines culinary execution.  I ordered the halibut and it tasted as if it were caught that day.   The cooking temperature ensured that the freshness of the fish hit me upon my first bite, at which time the flesh melts softly on the palate giving way to the sweet scent of the ocean.  That same consistency carries through the meal from the first bite to the last.  The perfect execution even carries to the vegetables and fingerling potatoes.  A million kudos the the chef.  The sommelier was able to offer the perfect selection to pair with our dishes.  All in all this made for the perfect dining experience. Before this meal, my favorite all time meal had been at Charlie Trotter's in Chicago.  That meal is now tied with the one I had at Bouillon Bilk.   Very interesting menu, creative flavor and texture combinations, amazing execution, beautiful presentation, and spectacular service.  The beet salad is transformative.  I also loved the lobster amuse-bouche, the scallops, the venison, the chocolate financier.  This is a very special dining experience.  Bravo!This was our favorite restaurant in Montreal. We arrived after hours of riding bikes.  We were casually dressed, sweaty, and covered in dust; however, the employees at Bouillon Bilk welcomed us just like the best dressed folks there.  We saw everybody at Bouillon Bilk.  There were beautifully dressed people in the restaurant as well as a casually dressed family. The restaurant itself is gorgeous.  The front windows let in lots of natural light.  The lines are straight and clean.  The elements were modern.  For example, the sink was outside of the bathroom and was long and communal.  It was really neat and surprising. And then the food.  M ordered the duck.  It was amazing.  She let me try some.  It was tender and melted in your mouth.  It melted and it mixed with the sauce and contrasted with the fresh greens.  It was a full song with harmony. I got the cucumber salad.  I love the freshness of cucumber and Bouillon Bilk took that characteristic and let it shine.  It was enhanced with a few radishes, some goat cheese and some crispy nuts.  It was crunchy, soft, and light. Next, we got three desserts: a cheese plate, strawberries, and chocolate.  Yum, yum, and YUM! When we first made our reservation, we were told that the table would need to be free by 8:00 PM.  As that time drew closer, and we were still enjoying our dessert, I asked our server.  He encouraged us to linger and submit to the pleasures before us. Our server also told us about our next favorite restaurant in Montreal: Hotel Herman.  We would have gone to Bouillon Bilk every evening if the menu was more extensive.  But that's some of the poetry of Bouillon Bilk.  It knows what it can do and it executes it will finesse. I love the name of this restaurant, WOO for alliteration.  Boullion Bilk - it's fun to say.  I find the name attractive as well as everything inside - environment and cuisine.  All appealing and cool and lovely.  The decor is extremely simple and clean.  Wooden floors, white walls, white tablecloths and napkins, big heavy wooden tables.  No crazy artwork or light fixtures, just simple textures and clean lines.  We started with the "Quebec Cheese Assortment" (5 cheeses for $20 or 3 for $15).  Of course we got 5, and they were each local and incredible.  I can't remember the exact names of each cheese, and I know they rotate depending on what's available, but they're five very different and beautiful options.  We ate every single bite, of course.  What's better than cheese?? I can't think of anything. For my entree, I ordered the scallop dish which comes with zucchini, shiitake mushrooms, pear, and watercress served in a brown butter.  Oh my stars, you guys.  These scallops were the most buttery, perfectly seared, velvety pieces of fish everrrr.  The brown butter was rich and fantastic and the pear provided a really interesting sweetness.  This particular dish was $31 which is a bit pricey considering the small portion.  It's enough food for one person surely, a healthy size, but I was craving a bit more in the end.  Wonderful wine menu here as well with some great local options. If you're in the mood for pretty plating and a business class type of atmosphere, Boullion Bilk is the perfect spot.  Service was down-to-earth and friendly, and despite my last minute booking we were able to nab a table for 3 on a Friday night.   Granted, we were only given a 10-minute window to actually get to the restaurant, but as we lived nearby anyway it wasn't too much of an issue.  With the goal to stuff myself silly with foie gras over the weekend, I started the meal with a foie gras appetizer.  A generous slab of deliciously seared foie, sitting on top of a slice of toasted brioche and prettily dotted by pureed raspberries and a beet reduction.  Apart from their regular menu were also a few daily special additions for the night (of which I unfortunately can't remember), but the scallops entree had caught my eye already anyway.   3 scallops in drool-inducing browned butter, the portion is a tad scanty but it makes me hungry just reminiscing about it.   My scallops were a tad bit overcooked - though far from the dreaded rubbery state, my inner bratty food snob says it could've used a literal *touch* less heat to retain more umami mouthfeel.   Hey, I did admit that it's quite bratty of me to point out such a minor detail - cause it was otherwise delicious.  The dessert, a rhubarb, strawberries and juniper dish with lime gremolata and little islands of buttermilk cream seemed to float in a translucent pinkish red pool, which turned out to be a very thin layer of set rhubarb gel.   Lovely dishes and all-around lovely place. There is a reason Buillon Bilk was named one of the restaurants to try in Montreal before you die.  This place is fabulous.  At first, the restaurant's exterior and interior decor is very plain.  You wouldn't expect this place to have it all.  But I came here not for the decor.  I came for the vibrant and decorative menu as well as the nightly specials.  Each dish from appetizers to dessert was thoroughly planned out with complimenting ingredients, bold colors and overwhelming flavors.  Calling the items I enjoyed fantastic was not enough.  I came here already full from the day's endless eating but had to make an attempt to sit down at Buillon Bilk on my last night in Montreal to try something.  I had the lobster appetizer and sea urchin linguini.  Both appetizers were drop dead fabulous! I can't imagine how numbing everything else on the menu could be.  I'm at a lost for words.  I could die happy.  Note to self: Come back to Montreal for more Buillon Bilk. This meal is right there with the best meals I've ever had.  The restaurant itself is small and trendy, and the hosts and waitstaff all very polite and knowledgable.  While the ambiance of the space and the attentiveness of our waiter definitely contributed to the experience, the real star of the night was the food. We started with cocktails and appetizers; the hamachi, and the sweetbreads with veal tongue.  The hamachi was served raw, and was paired with yuzu kosho, grapefruit, fennel, and cucumber.  Delicious, clean, and light.  The sweetbreads may have been the single best thing I had all night, and both they and the tongue were melt in your mouth tender.  For our entrees we had duck three ways (dumpling, breast, and heart), and halibut two ways (filet, and fried cheek).  All three variations of the duck were amazing.  The heart was meaty and tasty without being gamey, the breast was tender and paired perfectly with the cara cara orange, and the dumpling was good enough to be a dish of its own.  The fish was just as good, especially the cheek, which flaked apart as soon as the fork hit it.  We ended our meal with a pistachio financier served with black current, white chocolate, and basil.  Just sweet enough, and the perfect ending to a great meal.  The courteousness of the staff, the beautiful plating, and most importantly the flavor of the food make Bouillon Bilk a must try. This is a beautiful take on modern gourmet Canadian/North-American cuisine.  The restaurant itself is bare-walled and plain, and it's very a loud yet somehow intimate setting.  The waitstaff was a bit cold, but they were generally helpful with any questions we had with the menu. My friend ordered the rabbit and ravioli, and I ordered the halibut two ways (fried and sous-vide).  The portions here appear small, but they aren't ludicrously small.  After the bread and my entree, I was satisfied.  The halibut was excellent fried and even better sous-vide; I'd never had sous-vide before, but it was incredibly tender and moist. After the meal, we ordered the yogurt & mango & papaya dessert, and it was excellent.  Seriously the most creative and delicious dessert I've ever had.  Each component of the dessert blended together beautifully while being distinct flavors.  The contrast of texture was something that I've never seen executed so masterfully in a dessert.  You must order this dessert!Boy was our dinner at Buoillon Bilk the best meal we had in Montreal, maybe even one of the best dinners I've had, period!  We tried making a reservation the night before our actual dinner but it was completely booked.  Now I understand why!Firstly, the restaurant is beautiful, despite the confusing, yellow awning it stands under.   The interior is outrageously chic with plentiful seating and a cool bar area, where we dined.   Secondly, the staff is super friendly, in an unpretentious way.   Moreover, the food was AWESOME!  We ordered a dozen oysters to start with and to get our libidos going.   They were a mouthful, fresh and came with 3 sauces that one can do with or without.   For our entrees, we ordered the cod fish and scallops, both of which were gorgeously plated and delicious!!  My cod fish was so moist that it collapsed upon the stab of my fork (t'was a gentle stab).   The garnishments on the plate also paired very well with the fish.   The scallops were also perfectly seared with garnishments that complimented the shellfish very well.   We devoured every single last bit of our artistic entrees AND ordered the upside down peach cake with ice cream for dessert, which left us leaving the restaurant with nothing but satisfaction!Thank you Buoillon Bilk for a memorable meal that made our trip to Montreal that much more amazing!Great restaurant overall. Every single dish was impressive, rich and full of different flavors in great harmony. Service is outstanding, all simple details were just right. Loved everything.  We enjoyed a lovely evening. For our 1 year, my husband took me to a really fancy french restaurant called Bouillon Bilk , it took roughly 30 mins to walk there - this restaurant is located at a very sketch place.  There were construction everywhere and homeless tents were close to the area. . .  I seriously wonder why they decided to open a restaurant in this area?The food was superb though, the service is also fantastic.  The server pretty much memorized the menu, he told me about the special they were having $5 for 3 shrimps.  So I said why not! I should had known. . . . . .  tiny tiny tiny shrimps.  Picture below.  Well, I guess I kinda got 3 and a 1/2 shrimp.  He was being very generous.   I got the pasta.  Oh - it was delicious! I tried so so so hard to not just eat it all in one bite.  So I took little bites so my meal would last longer.  I am not meant to eat at a french cuisine. My husband had the short ribs Equally as good. The portion is wayyyyyyy too small for me.  I would have to order 5 plates to fill me up!Bouillon Bilk (BB) is one of the few places in Montreal that all my chef friends consistently recommend.  They pay attention to what these folks are doing.  I've been here for lunch or dinner well over 30 times the last few years (I often take work-related visitors for dinner here) and have never been disappointed.  Menu changes occur sufficiently often that it makes little sense to give details about the specific dishes I tried this time.  While some restaurants tend to be better at delivering certain types of dishes, I feel that BB is consistent - I don't remember ever having a dish that I didn't like and the highlights over time cannot be classified as a specific type. BB is also a very stylish spot and the service staff are helpful and extremely pleasant. This is one of my favorite food destinations in Montreal.  To reiterate: of my favorites, it is also the most consistent at delivering a solid dining experience. My muse was probably watching over, since it placed me within walking distance of Bouillon Bilk. . . Simple urban design, endless bar seating, low ceilings and dimmed lights set my mood right from the start. It's packed.  Always packed.  So do make reservations.  However - if you alone or do not mind eating at the bar, you can still score seat there. I asked sazerac as soon as I saw it on the list, but alas, it was not available that night, and my server (who was very helpful and nice, btw), recommended another drink of similar composition (name escapes me at the moment), which was incredibly well made. It's all started with perfect drink. . .  Followed by bread and butter. . .  Then, beautifully presented sweetbreads, veal tongue & celery root appetizer arrived.  My eyes lit up, and my taste buds started singing.  It was delicious.  But it was not over yet - my cleaned to the original shine plate disappeared magically, and in it place came main course - perfectly seared scallops, cauliflower, shiitake mushrooms & watercress.  I closed my eyes in joy and savored it piece by piece. . .  I was not planning on dessert (ok, that's a bold fat lie if you know me.  shhhh!), but I could not resist special that day - chocolate macaron, a scoop of ice cream & little cup of warmed wine, all together complimenting each other in taste pairing and in presentation. It was an amazing meal all together. For me, the class of Bouillon Bilk stands up there with Envy and Juni - with service, food and presentation being on the level that put it on the list of my forever favorites. FINALLY made it to Bouillon Bilk! It's been on my list for a very, very long time and the hype was definitely worth it.   First off, a 5:30pm reservation is definitely where it's at.  The restaurant opens exactly at 5:30 and you will be one of the first tables seated.  Within minutes, the rest of the place will be packed with all the other smart cookies who had the same plan as you.  That way you don't have to deal with too much of a backlog in the kitchen as you would if you were the second seating in the evening.  You even get the added bonus of dealing with extra-friendly staff at the beginning of service. In terms of decor, the crisp white tablecloths and the sparkling wine glasses are the first things you notice when you walk in the door.  In the middle of the dining room, the wooden bartop is attention-grabbing (Note to self: Ask to sit at the bar next time. . .  Just gorgeous!).  For service, the staff is VERY attentive and as another reviewer pointed out, they are absolute experts on the menu.  The waitress and chef were very accommodating for the dairy and nut allergies at our table.  Now, onto the foooooood: Lamb tartar - This was my first time trying lamb tartar and now I'm a big fan.  The combination of the smoky cabbage, crispy topping and some sort of stonefruit all on top of the lamb was just unreal.  Beef duo - Special of the night.  Grilled strip loin ("Melt-in-your-mouth") with braised beef cheeks (Super tender), veggies, mushroom and gnochhi (Original dish has butter, parmesan and sweet potato puree as well). Lobster cappelleti - Rich and indulgent, in the best way possible.  The mascarpone and cream filling was soooo savoury and satisfying.  Big chunks of lobster on top.  Crispy fried bits and some plainer green veggies on the side. . .  I was literally tasting perfection.  Chocolate ganache - With sour cream ice cream and lemon cream.  I was warned by previous reviews that dessert is not Bouillon Bilk's strong point.  I agree that it was average but there is nothing bad about the standard chocolate ganache.  To explain my four-star rating. . .  We both agreed (like other reviewers) that a five-star rating would be granted with slightly larger portion sizes.  Even after having three full courses, we were not that full.  Yes, the flavours, service and decor are top notch but just a little bit more food on their plates would be ideal!Very chic farm to table restaurant in Montreal has all the elements of a great restaurant.   Wine list was quite good with some reasonably priced gems.   Service was great and very attentive to all our requests (in English of course).   The highlights of the meal included the Hamachi appetizer, duck Margaret (two types of ducks) perfectly cooked, and the exceptional scallops.   If I lived here I would definitely go back!I really enjoyed my time here.  I loved the food.  Overall I would give it a 4. 5/5. We dropped in for our 8pm reservation.  The place was busy, there was a constant flow of people coming and going.  The host had this really awesome flower jacket, he was friendly and quick to offer to take our coats. Decor: Felt modern and elegant, with the white walls, which did make the place seem bigger.  However, there wasn't a lot of space between some of the tables.  Especially the single tables.  Would have liked just a bit more room to navigate.  They had a mix of different tables.  Higher wooden tables by the bar, and the shorter tables, with white table clothes in the main dining area.  Also some tables with booths. Service 3. 5/5There was a long wait between some of our appetizers and our main meal.  We didn't leave the restaurant until 2. 5 hours later.  They did forgot about 1 of our appetizers, so it was slow in coming out.  And then the main meal took a bit longer to come out.  Since there was a bigger group that put their order in before us.  They did apologize for the longer wait time, which was nice. Our server was great at describing every dish.  She was also very knowledgeable about the ingredients and the different wines that would pair well with our meal.  She was friendly and checked to make sure we had what we needed. Food 4. 5/5 Each and every dish was presented beautifully.  Truly works of art. Appetizer - Every appetizer we ordered was delicious. The sweetbreads were delicious and fried nice and soft.  This was my first time trying it and I really enjoyed it.  The veal tongue melted in your mouth.  It was soft and not chewy.  I loved the pear toffee reduction.  The toffee was unexpected, but add a nice sweet caramel taste.  The pear and toffee paired nicely with the sweetbreads and the tongue.  We order the special scallop amuse bouche twice because my boyfriend like it so much.  The scallops came with clementine and parsnip.  Scallops were fresh and succulent.  The sweetness of the scallops, were brought out by the clementine and lime juice.  The special appetizer of sashimi fluke was my favourite dish of the night.  I definitely had a wow moment after eating the dish.  It was that good.  This was accompanied by beets and plums.  That were sweet and delicious.  Fried capers were a lovely crunchy treat that added a crunchy texture to the dish.  Very pretty to look at.  MainVenison with hedgehog mushrooms.  Venison was very tender and delicious cooked perfectly.  The meat melted in your mouth.  The venison didn't have a gamey taste to it at all.  The inside was still pink and juicy.  This was served on a bed of quinoa with chestnuts and greens.   The chocolate coffee sauce brought the whole dish together.  I usually dislike chocolate in savoury dishes, but here the chocolate was light and not over powering.  My boyfriend ordered the sirloin steak with hedgehog mushrooms, snails and onions.  Steak was soft and pink in the centre.  You could truly taste the beef flavour coming through.  This was a good dish, but it was my least favourite dish of the night. We ordered the pear molasses cake with pear ginger, parsnip ice cream, to share.  I was truly blown away by the parsnip ice cream.  Who would think that this would make a nice ice cream flavour? It was really delicious and you could definitely taste the parsnip.  It was a nice way to finish the meal with something sweet but not overly sweet, which I find a lot of dessert can be.  It also wasn't too heavy, which was great especially after all the other food we ate. I would definitely come back to try their other dishes if I was in Montreal again. Found this restaurant on Eater's list of must eat restaurants in Montreal.  The restaurant is small w/ fine lines, white linen tables, and has a modern feel to it.  Street parking only.  The restaurant is a little tricky to find since there is no sign in front of the building itself, just the name on a semi hidden front entrance.  We totally missed the restaurant & walked 2 blocks too far until we realized we passed 1595.  Staff and service are both friendly.  There are 4 separate restrooms with a public sink area.  I definitely called the restaurant to make a reservation based on another yelper's recommendation.  Eating early definitely has its benefits.  We set the rsvp at 5:30 and sure enough the restaurant was packed by 6:30-7pm on a Monday evening.  For appetizers, we ordered:Cured mackerel w celery, green chickpeas, mint & rhubarb gelee (Amuse bouche of the day) - I didn't eat this dish bc I'm pregnant and it's "raw".  Hubby was thoroughly impressed & raved about this dish.  Steamed jumbo oyster w/ radish, pears & ginger fermented black bean broth (special of the day) - this oyster was packed a flavorful punch.  Everything worked so well together and the broth was magnificent. Pork shoulder tagliatelle - this dish was good, but we could of done without it.  Pasta was cooked perfectly and pork was tender.  The sour cream added a slight hint of "cheesy" tang that I didn't care for. Sweetbreads w/ veal tongue, celery root, shishito peppers & pineapple - WOW! This dish was amazing.  The sweetbreads were perfectly cooked & crispy, the veal tongue was tender & full of flavor, the celery root purée was silky smooth, the thinly shaved celery root was pickled just right and the char on the shishito peppers added a nice smokiness to the dish.  The little bits of caramelized pineapple added a nice amount of sweetness. For our entrees, we ordered: Halibut two ways w/ a broccoli purée & florets, shiitake mushrooms, potatoes, Muscat grapes & hazelnuts - the crispy halibut nugget was the best element of this dish.  The main halibut itself was delicate and tender, but had a slight fishy taste to it.  Not sure how fresh the quality of the fish was.   The grapes and onions added a little bit too much sweetness to the dish.  The shiitake mushrooms were bland and the broccoli florets were a little over cooked.  This dish was crying for acidity and a squeeze of lemon definitely helped.  Quail w/ quail egg, fava beans, potato, & parsnips (special of the evening) - OMG this dish was divine! Perfectly seasoned & cooked quail.  The quail was slightly crisp and the sauce that came w it was smooth and rich.  All of the elements were superb.  Overall, we would totally return to this restaurant bc everything was executed well and the flavor profiles of each dish was exceptional (except for minor issues w/ the tagliatelle and halibut).  The only thing I didn't like about this restaurant was the inflexibility of the chef/cooks not wanting to cook any proteins above medium rare.  For someone who is pregnant and careful with how her food is prepared, I would have appreciated it if the chef/cook was willing to cook the protein to at least medium/medium well so that there's less of a potential illness or harm to my unborn child.  For that reason, I had to go with the halibut dish which I wasn't that impressed with.  I definitely recommend this restaurant.  Some yelpers commented on how small the portions are, but if the server times out each course right, the dishes are actually filling.  If not, fill up on their complimentary bread and butter!
