My fiancé and I came to visit Montreal over Labor Day weekend coming from the U.S. and was craving for some ramen. We found this little Korean restaurant on yelp and wanted to give it a try. Here's my story on their service.My cousin and his girlfriend (which are both from the U.S. As well arrived there first and grabbed us a table since we were running behind since our hotel was a bit further away. The waitress was very kind and let them reserve a table while waiting for our arrival. We finally arrived and parked in the parking lot right next to the restaurant (which wasn't free). All I had on me was larger CAD $20 to pay for the parking machine when all I needed was CAD $7. I asked our waitress if it was possible to give us some change and she gladly helped. Thumbs up on great service. Now the review that people really care about.. Their food and beverage. I had the bulgogi ramyun and Korean Soda with milk flavor. The ramyun was delicious. Good portions of ramen noodles and meat. Enough to make you full and not making you leave feeling like a fat kid. The soda was okay. It was my first time trying it. Overall, everyone in my party enjoyed their meal. The environment was great as well with a younger crowd and also families. Ill definitely come back here whenever we are back in Canada.Eum, not sure if it's my poor choices or I'm just not a huge fan of korean food, but I've visited GaNaDaRa three times, picking three different dishes.On my first visit, I had the squid dub bap. I liked the taste and presentation, but after 5 spoonfuls, I felt like all the grease from the fried food (veggies and squid) was just too much --  I couldn't finish the plate. Also, I was disappointed that it was mostly fried carrots and rice with very few squid.The second time, I had the supreme poutine. Yes yes yes, you're gonna tell me i asked for it -- well it's too late now, but ordering poutine in an asian restaurant really wasn't a fantastic idea on hindsight: mixing kimchi, seafood, and rice cakes with cheese and fries must be the work of a maverick. Never in my life have I had so many contrasting flavors disagreeing with half the others in 1 dish. I noted the fries were particularly crispy on the outside, and fluffy on the inside. The grilled chicken and bugolgi were also very tasty. I didn't like the other ingredients. And so I came back a third time, for grilled chicken. This time, I got the dak dolsot bibimbap. The flavors were diverse and appropriately balanced, but it lacked salt. And more chicken would have been better.I'm still not an expert in Korean cuisine, but I'm rating this 4/5 for the helpful staff, generally decent food, and k-pop atmosphere. Do yourself a favor and not a Supreme Poutine.Great tasty food if you like asian fusion. And even if you're not a huge fan like me, try it!  The staff are so patient and helpful, I called to pick up an order really close to closing time and the lady explained every single thing I asked about without rushing me at all. And then she invited me to come in so that she would explain some more! I'm glad I did because I really didn't expect the place to look so clean and modern! It was a pleasant surprise. There's usually a line outside that's why I was tempted to try it and I'm glad I did. Everything was tasty, even the famous "seafood pancake" which I was a bit skeptical about. The portions are so big but why not?Definitely worth a try.I am so sad to give Ganadara a 2.5/5. After the renovation the consistency of the food has been a disappointment. I come to ganadara at least once every two weeks and I've tried almost everything on their menu. The poutine (favorite of mine), the portion is smaller, the sauce isnt as spicy, the sauce is runny, bland and boiled cabbage is added (which i think is one of the reasons why its bland). I found out the chef prepares it differently. Instead of reheating the sauce for every order, it is put in a slowcooker and poured on the fries when ordered. Meaning the sauce doesnt have time to thicken up making its so runny that the fries get soggy a lot quicker.The cheese bimbimbap was bland and the cheese made it oily and hard to eat. The ramen is no longer served in the sizzling pot which is fine but the soup isn't boiling hot anymore (which i loved on a winter day). The broth isnt as spicy and flavourful. The sushis, i really appreciate the half portions because I always want to try all of them but it ends up being too much. After the renovations the portions were smaller and prices went up by a dollar (doesnt seem much but a dollar to everything adds up). Overall I would recommend it but being a long time customer, I am disappointed in the food Ganadara's been serving.Came here with my mom. Initially was hard to find because there was no billboard...Ordered the Korean sushi (Kim bab) with a bowl of squid/veggies on rice with the help of the waiter. Only issue I had was that the bowl was WAY too spicy for both my mom and myself... Wish we had a heads up for that... Only after the waiter said he could have made it less spicy. Oh and I normally love and eat spicy food all the time. Maybe the chef added too much spicy sauce? But I'm not one to complain so I left it as is. I think my mom and I would have LOVED THE BOWLS and enjoyed our experience more if it was less spicy.In one sentence, it's average. I gave it a 3.5 instead of 3 because I love Korean food. Pros:(+) Affordable price point(+) Easy access/great location(+) Great selection of Korean foodCons:(-) Not the best quality of food(-) Have gotten sick from eating here before(-) A little cramped in terms of spaceIt's been around 2 weeks since they've reopened (closed for renovations for March and April) and the line here is still super long! Came here with 2 friends for dinner around 6, and waited ~35 minutes to get seated. The interior is kinda small, and I think their seating makes it a bit cramped. There are a lot of tables with 2 seats, but only a couple tables with 4 seats, so if you don't want to wait long, I'd recommend coming here when they open, or coming here with just another person!My friends and I decided to share everything, and we ordered the dubboki tsunami (I may have butchered the spelling), the tofu dolsot bibimbap, and the curry tonkatsu. The tofu dolsot bibimbap was pretty good, and included tofu (obviously), shredded carrots, mushrooms, cucumbers, bean sprouts, and chickpeas! It was pretty good, but I found the rice to be a bit flavourless. The dubboki tsunami came with dubboki, ramen, fried kimbap, fish cake, deep fried veggies, deep fried mushrooms, and hard boiled eggs. I really enjoyed the deep fried mushrooms in this dish - they were super juicy. The dish overall was very good, but I think there were too many fried things in this dish (fried kimbap sounded good, but was a bit too much for me) I really enjoyed the curry sauce in the curry tonkatsu, and the tonkatsu was pretty tender as well! Overall, I'd say ganadara is a pretty good bet for good Korean food in downtown Montreal, and definitely worth a visit !Okay, yeah, the reviews did NOT lead me astray. This place is AMAZING. Amazing. I left, already thinking about what I would order next time.There tends to be a line out the door, so plan accordingly. But it moves quickly. Service was fantastic.I really appreciated the menu. Enough options to give you some choice, without being completely overwhelming. I'm not that familiar with Korean food and felt totally comfortable ordering. We started with the Dak Bal - awesome. The dolsot bibimbap with tofu was, I thought, a bit bland. But, I mean, so it required a lot of sauce. No big deal.Anyway, definitely my new favorite place in this part of town.Best Korean restaurant in Montreal!!My friends and I love here so much. Staff are friendly and the food is simply awesome. All the foods are very nice, especially the spicy chicken wings, which was recommended by the staff there!This was my first time back here ever since it finished renovating two months ago and I have to say, the place looks so much more polished. There was a short line right outside the door but we were two people so there was no wait at all (and because it was 2:30pm so most of the traffic from lunchtime cleared out by then).We ordered the tuna kimbap and the dolsot bibimbap to share between two and it also came with a couple bites of kimchi before our food came. The bibimbap was pretty good, though a little bland after a while unless paired with the sauce that it came with, which I expected to be spicier but was more of a salty flavour. Also, the chickpeas were unexpected and threw me off a little. The kimbap was tasty, but had too much mayonnaise for my taste. The portions were a good amount - we finished the meal with two kimbaps leftover.Overall a satisfactory lunch.Pretty good value for food and rather quick. Old faithful.Great little spot near the museum.The menu had some great option and the food was delicious and the design of this place is just a plus (I liked the lights).Its a bit hard to find but its right next to a laundry place.My boyfriend and I decided to try Ganadara for the first time. We had to wait in line for about 20 minutes before we got to sat down at a table.For our appetizer we ordered the fried dumplings and it came with a salad in the middle which was weird. The dumplings were good but I think it would of tasted better if they weren't deep fried. The waitress gave us a small complimentary plate of kimchi and I thought it was gross. I didn't like how the Kimchi was served warm, it should of been served cold. I ordered the seafood soondubu and it was piping hot and delicious. My boyfriend ordered the curry tonkatsu with rice. The tonkatsu portion was pretty big and he really enjoyed it. Overall, I think Ganadara's food is good for Montreal.The service was only okay. It's not the best service because the restaurant is really busy. Sometimes I have to ask the server the same questions a few times. The ambiance was loud because it was filled with young people. Ganadara is a little small and cramped. Also seems like they don't turn on their air conditioning or maybe they don't have one. This restaurant is not recommended for big groups.A new, bustling, cute restaurant downtown, Ganadara does not disappont!We walked in here simply because of how packed it was (on a Monday night close to 10pm) and were seated at lightening speed. The menu is extensive and we ended up ordering several items to share including their 'sushi' roll, friend chicken bites, bulgogi, and another meat dish I can't remember. Our food was either amazing or bland but the many flavors presented were appreciated.The waiters were very quick and helpful. It's been a while since I've seen school great service!Overall a really nice place. We will definitely be back to try more items (and get the bulgogi again because it was so good)Fantastic Korean restaurant. We went there at 8:30 last night and we waited for 20min. Overall, it's still a great restaurant! Love the bibimbop.This is my favorite Korean restaurant! Everything is so delicious and the prices are super reasonable!I would recommend dak ball and beef stew.The first time we came here, it was more out of curiosity to be honest. We had past this place a couple of times, and wondered why there was always a line. So glad we decided to be "followers" lol. We were happily surprised by the prices, so were able to order a few dishes to try and share. I don't remember all the names, so I won't be helpful in that regards. I do know my boyfriend got the dakbal dish and he really, really enjoyed it. We also got the seafood pancake (yum!), beef ramen (for the bf), a fried seafood & rice dish, and the sushi. Everything was delicious and filling! The second time I came, my boyfriend and his friend got rice dishes, and I had the sushi again with the vegetable dumplings. Those were gooood. Of course the wait isn't the best thing ever, but just come when you aren't at the "starving, need to eat something now" point lol - I've learnt my lesson!It was my first time eating here after their renovation and I honestly have to say it was hands down, the best korean restaurant I've ever been to (Amongst 2-3 others). Just a quick description of what their food is like, it's kind of a korean restaurant that serves regular korean dishes and some of it with a twist. Despite the waiting line of 20 minutes + ish (which was worth it and expected because the food is so good), the service/workers were very nice and friendly. It's not really a huge restaurant, but it still felt pretty nice. I went with my sister (who has already been there and loves their bulgogi), and the waitress asked us if we minded sharing a table with two other people. We were okay with it, but it still felt kind of awkward. Their menu has some images to help you know what some food are/look like, but not all of them had an image. It also has a description of what some of the food consists of and whether it's spicy, vegetarian or semi-vegetarian. The fact that it was my first time, I kinda knew what I already wanted (Rabboki) due to other reviews and pictures, but I still wanted to make sure that my dish was what I wanted, so I asked the waitress and she kindly told me what it was. After ordering, a table for 2 was available and one of the waiters asked us if we were okay to sit there, obviously we were okay with it and felt better. After switching places, we were given menus 3 times from the three waiters (including the one that took our order) which was kind of funny because they didn't know/weren't sure if we already ordered. I thought to myself that that was pretty much good service because they wanted to make sure that all their customers were served and I understood that it kind of confused them since we changed places. Anyway, the wait for our food was probably 15 minutes, which didn't really bother me since the food was GREAT! :)Service: The service was okay. The restaurant was in a bit of a rush so our waiter seemed impatient to take our order, which is normal. Also, the waitresses did not seem to notice when my glass of water was empty, I had to ask her for more water, which is okay, the problem was that she forgot me. Because it was no longer a rush when she forgot me, I cannot say that the service was good. Except from that, everything else was okay.Score: 3.5/5Food: It was my first time coming back since the renovations, and my friend told me that the food was a bit different. Indeed, the menu changed, and prices went up, which was expected. My friend and I ordered the seafood ramyun, the dak ball and the bibimbap in a stone bowl. Honestly, I believe that the ramyun is not that different from the dried noodles we find in groceries. The dak ball (fried chicken with a sweet sauce) was really good, as always. And the bibimbap was good also. I highly recommend to pay the extra 1$ for the stone bowl, I find it way better.Score: 4/5Ambiance: The restaurant is really small and there is a screen playing KPOP MVs. In general, the ambiance is nice, but I prefer the way it was before the decoration, it simply felt a bit more cozy.Score: 3.5/5Good food, good service! The place is always packed but the noise level is perfectly acceptable. The bibimbap was one of the best I've had in Montreal. Cant speak to the rest. The mushrooms were cooked just right!The decor is the best best the ambiance is still there. K-Pop is playing in the background all the time. It is pretty cool. It can be cramped depending on where you are sitting. If you don't mind waiting in line for 20 minutes you will definitely enjoy your meal.My fiancé and I came to visit Montreal over Labor Day weekend coming from the U.S. and was craving for some ramen.

The grilled chicken and bugolgi were also very tasty. I didn't like the other ingredients. And so I came back a third time, for grilled chicken. This time, I got the dak dolsot bibimbap. The flavors were diverse and appropriately balanced, but it lacked salt. And more chicken would have been better.I'm still not an expert in Korean cuisine, but I'm rating this 4/5 for the helpful staff, generally decent food, and k-pop atmosphere. Do yourself a favor and not a Supreme Poutine.Great tasty food if you like asian fusion. And even if you're not a huge fan like me, try it!  The staff are so patient and helpful, I called to pick up an order really close to closing time and the lady explained every single thing I asked about without rushing me at all. And then she invited me to come in so that she would explain some more! I'm glad I did because I really didn't expect the place to look so clean and modern! It was a pleasant surprise. There's usually a line outside that's why I was tempted to try it and I'm glad I did. Everything was tasty, even the famous "seafood pancake" which I was a bit skeptical about. The portions are so big but why not?Definitely worth a try.I am so sad to give Ganadara a 2.5/5. After the renovation the consistency of the food has been a disappointment. I come to ganadara at least once every two weeks and I've tried almost everything on their menu. The poutine (favorite of mine), the portion is smaller, the sauce isnt as spicy, the sauce is runny, bland and boiled cabbage is added (which i think is one of the reasons why its bland). I found out the chef prepares it differently. Instead of reheating the sauce for every order, it is put in a slowcooker and poured on the fries when ordered. Meaning the sauce doesnt have time to thicken up making its so runny that the fries get soggy a lot quicker.The cheese bimbimbap was bland and the cheese made it oily and hard to eat. The ramen is no longer served in the sizzling pot which is fine but the soup isn't boiling hot anymore (which i loved on a winter day). The broth isnt as spicy and flavourful. The sushis, i really appreciate the half portions because I always want to try all of them but it ends up being too much. After the renovations the portions were smaller and prices went up by a dollar (doesnt seem much but a dollar to everything adds up). Overall I would recommend it but being a long time customer, I am disappointed in the food Ganadara's been serving.Came here with my mom. Initially was hard to find because there was no billboard...Ordered the Korean sushi (Kim bab) with a bowl of squid/veggies on rice with the help of the waiter. Only issue I had was that the bowl was WAY too spicy for both my mom and myself... Wish we had a heads up for that... Only after the waiter said he could have made it less spicy. Oh and I normally love and eat spicy food all the time. Maybe the chef added too much spicy sauce? But I'm not one to complain so I left it as is. I think my mom and I would have LOVED THE BOWLS and enjoyed our experience more if it was less spicy.In one sentence, it's average. I gave it a 3.5 instead of 3 because I love Korean food. Pros:(+) Affordable price point(+) Easy access/great location(+) Great selection of Korean foodCons:(-) Not the best quality of food(-) Have gotten sick from eating here before(-) A little cramped in terms of spaceIt's been around 2 weeks since they've reopened (closed for renovations for March and April) and the line here is still super long! Came here with 2 friends for dinner around 6, and waited ~35 minutes to get seated. The interior is kinda small, and I think their seating makes it a bit cramped. There are a lot of tables with 2 seats, but only a couple tables with 4 seats, so if you don't want to wait long, I'd recommend coming here when they open, or coming here with just another person!My friends and I decided to share everything, and we ordered the dubboki tsunami (I may have butchered the spelling), the tofu dolsot bibimbap, and the curry tonkatsu. The tofu dolsot bibimbap was pretty good, and included tofu (obviously), shredded carrots, mushrooms, cucumbers, bean sprouts, and chickpeas! It was pretty good, but I found the rice to be a bit flavourless. The dubboki tsunami came with dubboki, ramen, fried kimbap, fish cake, deep fried veggies, deep fried mushrooms, and hard boiled eggs. I really enjoyed the deep fried mushrooms in this dish - they were super juicy. The dish overall was very good, but I think there were too many fried things in this dish (fried kimbap sounded good, but was a bit too much for me) I really enjoyed the curry sauce in the curry tonkatsu, and the tonkatsu was pretty tender as well! Overall, I'd say ganadara is a pretty good bet for good Korean food in downtown Montreal, and definitely worth a visit !Okay, yeah, the reviews did NOT lead me astray. This place is AMAZING. Amazing. I left, already thinking about what I would order next time.There tends to be a line out the door, so plan accordingly. But it moves quickly. Service was fantastic.I really appreciated the menu. Enough options to give you some choice, without being completely overwhelming. I'm not that familiar with Korean food and felt totally comfortable ordering. We started with the Dak Bal - awesome. The dolsot bibimbap with tofu was, I thought, a bit bland. But, I mean, so it required a lot of sauce. No big deal.Anyway, definitely my new favorite place in this part of town.Best Korean restaurant in Montreal!!My friends and I love here so much. Staff are friendly and the food is simply awesome. All the foods are very nice, especially the spicy chicken wings, which was recommended by the staff there!This was my first time back here ever since it finished renovating two months ago and I have to say, the place looks so much more polished. There was a short line right outside the door but we were two people so there was no wait at all (and because it was 2:30pm so most of the traffic from lunchtime cleared out by then).We ordered the tuna kimbap and the dolsot bibimbap to share between two and it also came with a couple bites of kimchi before our food came. The bibimbap was pretty good, though a little bland after a while unless paired with the sauce that it came with, which I expected to be spicier but was more of a salty flavour. Also, the chickpeas were unexpected and threw me off a little. The kimbap was tasty, but had too much mayonnaise for my taste. The portions were a good amount - we finished the meal with two kimbaps leftover.Overall a satisfactory lunch.Pretty good value for food and rather quick. Old faithful.Great little spot near the museum.The menu had some great option and the food was delicious and the design of this place is just a plus (I liked the lights).Its a bit hard to find but its right next to a laundry place.My boyfriend and I decided to try Ganadara for the first time. We had to wait in line for about 20 minutes before we got to sat down at a table.For our appetizer we ordered the fried dumplings and it came with a salad in the middle which was weird. The dumplings were good but I think it would of tasted better if they weren't deep fried. The waitress gave us a small complimentary plate of kimchi and I thought it was gross. I didn't like how the Kimchi was served warm, it should of been served cold. I ordered the seafood soondubu and it was piping hot and delicious. My boyfriend ordered the curry tonkatsu with rice. The tonkatsu portion was pretty big and he really enjoyed it. Overall, I think Ganadara's food is good for Montreal.The service was only okay. It's not the best service because the restaurant is really busy. Sometimes I have to ask the server the same questions a few times. The ambiance was loud because it was filled with young people. Ganadara is a little small and cramped. Also seems like they don't turn on their air conditioning or maybe they don't have one. This restaurant is not recommended for big groups.A new, bustling, cute restaurant downtown, Ganadara does not disappont!We walked in here simply because of how packed it was (on a Monday night close to 10pm) and were seated at lightening speed. The menu is extensive and we ended up ordering several items to share including their 'sushi' roll, friend chicken bites, bulgogi, and another meat dish I can't remember. Our food was either amazing or bland but the many flavors presented were appreciated.The waiters were very quick and helpful. It's been a while since I've seen school great service!Overall a really nice place. We will definitely be back to try more items (and get the bulgogi again because it was so good)Fantastic Korean restaurant. We went there at 8:30 last night and we waited for 20min. Overall, it's still a great restaurant! Love the bibimbop.This is my favorite Korean restaurant! Everything is so delicious and the prices are super reasonable!I would recommend dak ball and beef stew.The first time we came here, it was more out of curiosity to be honest. We had past this place a couple of times, and wondered why there was always a line. So glad we decided to be "followers" lol. We were happily surprised by the prices, so were able to order a few dishes to try and share. I don't remember all the names, so I won't be helpful in that regards. I do know my boyfriend got the dakbal dish and he really, really enjoyed it. We also got the seafood pancake (yum!), beef ramen (for the bf), a fried seafood & rice dish, and the sushi. Everything was delicious and filling! The second time I came, my boyfriend and his friend got rice dishes, and I had the sushi again with the vegetable dumplings. Those were gooood. Of course the wait isn't the best thing ever, but just come when you aren't at the "starving, need to eat something now" point lol - I've learnt my lesson!It was my first time eating here after their renovation and I honestly have to say it was hands down, the best korean restaurant I've ever been to (Amongst 2-3 others). Just a quick description of what their food is like, it's kind of a korean restaurant that serves regular korean dishes and some of it with a twist. Despite the waiting line of 20 minutes + ish (which was worth it and expected because the food is so good), the service/workers were very nice and friendly. It's not really a huge restaurant, but it still felt pretty nice. I went with my sister (who has already been there and loves their bulgogi), and the waitress asked us if we minded sharing a table with two other people. We were okay with it, but it still felt kind of awkward. Their menu has some images to help you know what some food are/look like, but not all of them had an image. It also has a description of what some of the food consists of and whether it's spicy, vegetarian or semi-vegetarian. The fact that it was my first time, I kinda knew what I already wanted (Rabboki) due to other reviews and pictures, but I still wanted to make sure that my dish was what I wanted, so I asked the waitress and she kindly told me what it was. After ordering, a table for 2 was available and one of the waiters asked us if we were okay to sit there, obviously we were okay with it and felt better. After switching places, we were given menus 3 times from the three waiters (including the one that took our order) which was kind of funny because they didn't know/weren't sure if we already ordered. I thought to myself that that was pretty much good service because they wanted to make sure that all their customers were served and I understood that it kind of confused them since we changed places. Anyway, the wait for our food was probably 15 minutes, which didn't really bother me since the food was GREAT! :)Service: The service was okay. The restaurant was in a bit of a rush so our waiter seemed impatient to take our order, which is normal. Also, the waitresses did not seem to notice when my glass of water was empty, I had to ask her for more water, which is okay, the problem was that she forgot me. Because it was no longer a rush when she forgot me, I cannot say that the service was good. Except from that, everything else was okay.Score: 3.5/5Food: It was my first time coming back since the renovations, and my friend told me that the food was a bit different. Indeed, the menu changed, and prices went up, which was expected. My friend and I ordered the seafood ramyun, the dak ball and the bibimbap in a stone bowl. Honestly, I believe that the ramyun is not that different from the dried noodles we find in groceries. The dak ball (fried chicken with a sweet sauce) was really good, as always. And the bibimbap was good also. I highly recommend to pay the extra 1$ for the stone bowl, I find it way better.Score: 4/5Ambiance: The restaurant is really small and there is a screen playing KPOP MVs. In general, the ambiance is nice, but I prefer the way it was before the decoration, it simply felt a bit more cozy.Score: 3.5/5Good food, good service! The place is always packed but the noise level is perfectly acceptable. The bibimbap was one of the best I've had in Montreal. Cant speak to the rest. The mushrooms were cooked just right!The decor is the best best the ambiance is still there. K-Pop is playing in the background all the time. It is pretty cool. It can be cramped depending on where you are sitting. If you don't mind waiting in line for 20 minutes you will definitely enjoy your meal.My fiancé and I came to visit Montreal over Labor Day weekend coming from the U.S. and was craving for some ramen. We found this little Korean restaurant on yelp and wanted to give it a try. Here's my story on their service.My cousin and his girlfriend (which are both from the U.S. As well arrived there first and grabbed us a table since we were running behind since our hotel was a bit further away. The waitress was very kind and let them reserve a table while waiting for our arrival. We finally arrived and parked in the parking lot right next to the restaurant (which wasn't free). All I had on me was larger CAD $20 to pay for the parking machine when all I needed was CAD $7. I asked our waitress if it was possible to give us some change and she gladly helped. Thumbs up on great service. Now the review that people really care about.. Their food and beverage. I had the bulgogi ramyun and Korean Soda with milk flavor. The ramyun was delicious. Good portions of ramen noodles and meat. Enough to make you full and not making you leave feeling like a fat kid. The soda was okay. It was my first time trying it. Overall, everyone in my party enjoyed their meal. The environment was great as well with a younger crowd and also families. Ill definitely come back here whenever we are back in Canada.Eum, not sure if it's my poor choices or I'm just not a huge fan of korean food, but I've visited GaNaDaRa three times, picking three different dishes.On my first visit, I had the squid dub bap. I liked the taste and presentation, but after 5 spoonfuls, I felt like all the grease from the fried food (veggies and squid) was just too much --  I couldn't finish the plate. Also, I was disappointed that it was mostly fried carrots and rice with very few squid.The second time, I had the supreme poutine. Yes yes yes, you're gonna tell me i asked for it -- well it's too late now, but ordering poutine in an asian restaurant really wasn't a fantastic idea on hindsight: mixing kimchi, seafood, and rice cakes with cheese and fries must be the work of a maverick.

Meaning the sauce doesnt have time to thicken up making its so runny that the fries get soggy a lot quicker.The cheese bimbimbap was bland and the cheese made it oily and hard to eat. The ramen is no longer served in the sizzling pot which is fine but the soup isn't boiling hot anymore (which i loved on a winter day). The broth isnt as spicy and flavourful. The sushis, i really appreciate the half portions because I always want to try all of them but it ends up being too much. After the renovations the portions were smaller and prices went up by a dollar (doesnt seem much but a dollar to everything adds up). Overall I would recommend it but being a long time customer, I am disappointed in the food Ganadara's been serving.Came here with my mom. Initially was hard to find because there was no billboard...Ordered the Korean sushi (Kim bab) with a bowl of squid/veggies on rice with the help of the waiter. Only issue I had was that the bowl was WAY too spicy for both my mom and myself... Wish we had a heads up for that... Only after the waiter said he could have made it less spicy. Oh and I normally love and eat spicy food all the time. Maybe the chef added too much spicy sauce? But I'm not one to complain so I left it as is. I think my mom and I would have LOVED THE BOWLS and enjoyed our experience more if it was less spicy.In one sentence, it's average. I gave it a 3.5 instead of 3 because I love Korean food. Pros:(+) Affordable price point(+) Easy access/great location(+) Great selection of Korean foodCons:(-) Not the best quality of food(-) Have gotten sick from eating here before(-) A little cramped in terms of spaceIt's been around 2 weeks since they've reopened (closed for renovations for March and April) and the line here is still super long! Came here with 2 friends for dinner around 6, and waited ~35 minutes to get seated. The interior is kinda small, and I think their seating makes it a bit cramped. There are a lot of tables with 2 seats, but only a couple tables with 4 seats, so if you don't want to wait long, I'd recommend coming here when they open, or coming here with just another person!My friends and I decided to share everything, and we ordered the dubboki tsunami (I may have butchered the spelling), the tofu dolsot bibimbap, and the curry tonkatsu. The tofu dolsot bibimbap was pretty good, and included tofu (obviously), shredded carrots, mushrooms, cucumbers, bean sprouts, and chickpeas! It was pretty good, but I found the rice to be a bit flavourless. The dubboki tsunami came with dubboki, ramen, fried kimbap, fish cake, deep fried veggies, deep fried mushrooms, and hard boiled eggs. I really enjoyed the deep fried mushrooms in this dish - they were super juicy. The dish overall was very good, but I think there were too many fried things in this dish (fried kimbap sounded good, but was a bit too much for me) I really enjoyed the curry sauce in the curry tonkatsu, and the tonkatsu was pretty tender as well! Overall, I'd say ganadara is a pretty good bet for good Korean food in downtown Montreal, and definitely worth a visit !Okay, yeah, the reviews did NOT lead me astray. This place is AMAZING. Amazing. I left, already thinking about what I would order next time.There tends to be a line out the door, so plan accordingly. But it moves quickly. Service was fantastic.I really appreciated the menu. Enough options to give you some choice, without being completely overwhelming. I'm not that familiar with Korean food and felt totally comfortable ordering. We started with the Dak Bal - awesome. The dolsot bibimbap with tofu was, I thought, a bit bland. But, I mean, so it required a lot of sauce. No big deal.Anyway, definitely my new favorite place in this part of town.Best Korean restaurant in Montreal!!My friends and I love here so much. Staff are friendly and the food is simply awesome. All the foods are very nice, especially the spicy chicken wings, which was recommended by the staff there!This was my first time back here ever since it finished renovating two months ago and I have to say, the place looks so much more polished. There was a short line right outside the door but we were two people so there was no wait at all (and because it was 2:30pm so most of the traffic from lunchtime cleared out by then).We ordered the tuna kimbap and the dolsot bibimbap to share between two and it also came with a couple bites of kimchi before our food came. The bibimbap was pretty good, though a little bland after a while unless paired with the sauce that it came with, which I expected to be spicier but was more of a salty flavour. Also, the chickpeas were unexpected and threw me off a little. The kimbap was tasty, but had too much mayonnaise for my taste. The portions were a good amount - we finished the meal with two kimbaps leftover.Overall a satisfactory lunch.Pretty good value for food and rather quick. Old faithful.Great little spot near the museum.The menu had some great option and the food was delicious and the design of this place is just a plus (I liked the lights).Its a bit hard to find but its right next to a laundry place.My boyfriend and I decided to try Ganadara for the first time. We had to wait in line for about 20 minutes before we got to sat down at a table.For our appetizer we ordered the fried dumplings and it came with a salad in the middle which was weird. The dumplings were good but I think it would of tasted better if they weren't deep fried. The waitress gave us a small complimentary plate of kimchi and I thought it was gross. I didn't like how the Kimchi was served warm, it should of been served cold. I ordered the seafood soondubu and it was piping hot and delicious. My boyfriend ordered the curry tonkatsu with rice. The tonkatsu portion was pretty big and he really enjoyed it. Overall, I think Ganadara's food is good for Montreal.The service was only okay. It's not the best service because the restaurant is really busy. Sometimes I have to ask the server the same questions a few times. The ambiance was loud because it was filled with young people. Ganadara is a little small and cramped. Also seems like they don't turn on their air conditioning or maybe they don't have one. This restaurant is not recommended for big groups.A new, bustling, cute restaurant downtown, Ganadara does not disappont!We walked in here simply because of how packed it was (on a Monday night close to 10pm) and were seated at lightening speed. The menu is extensive and we ended up ordering several items to share including their 'sushi' roll, friend chicken bites, bulgogi, and another meat dish I can't remember. Our food was either amazing or bland but the many flavors presented were appreciated.The waiters were very quick and helpful. It's been a while since I've seen school great service!Overall a really nice place. We will definitely be back to try more items (and get the bulgogi again because it was so good)Fantastic Korean restaurant. We went there at 8:30 last night and we waited for 20min. Overall, it's still a great restaurant! Love the bibimbop.This is my favorite Korean restaurant! Everything is so delicious and the prices are super reasonable!I would recommend dak ball and beef stew.The first time we came here, it was more out of curiosity to be honest. We had past this place a couple of times, and wondered why there was always a line. So glad we decided to be "followers" lol. We were happily surprised by the prices, so were able to order a few dishes to try and share. I don't remember all the names, so I won't be helpful in that regards. I do know my boyfriend got the dakbal dish and he really, really enjoyed it. We also got the seafood pancake (yum!), beef ramen (for the bf), a fried seafood & rice dish, and the sushi. Everything was delicious and filling! The second time I came, my boyfriend and his friend got rice dishes, and I had the sushi again with the vegetable dumplings. Those were gooood. Of course the wait isn't the best thing ever, but just come when you aren't at the "starving, need to eat something now" point lol - I've learnt my lesson!It was my first time eating here after their renovation and I honestly have to say it was hands down, the best korean restaurant I've ever been to (Amongst 2-3 others). Just a quick description of what their food is like, it's kind of a korean restaurant that serves regular korean dishes and some of it with a twist. Despite the waiting line of 20 minutes + ish (which was worth it and expected because the food is so good), the service/workers were very nice and friendly. It's not really a huge restaurant, but it still felt pretty nice. I went with my sister (who has already been there and loves their bulgogi), and the waitress asked us if we minded sharing a table with two other people. We were okay with it, but it still felt kind of awkward. Their menu has some images to help you know what some food are/look like, but not all of them had an image. It also has a description of what some of the food consists of and whether it's spicy, vegetarian or semi-vegetarian. The fact that it was my first time, I kinda knew what I already wanted (Rabboki) due to other reviews and pictures, but I still wanted to make sure that my dish was what I wanted, so I asked the waitress and she kindly told me what it was. After ordering, a table for 2 was available and one of the waiters asked us if we were okay to sit there, obviously we were okay with it and felt better. After switching places, we were given menus 3 times from the three waiters (including the one that took our order) which was kind of funny because they didn't know/weren't sure if we already ordered. I thought to myself that that was pretty much good service because they wanted to make sure that all their customers were served and I understood that it kind of confused them since we changed places. Anyway, the wait for our food was probably 15 minutes, which didn't really bother me since the food was GREAT! :)Service: The service was okay. The restaurant was in a bit of a rush so our waiter seemed impatient to take our order, which is normal. Also, the waitresses did not seem to notice when my glass of water was empty, I had to ask her for more water, which is okay, the problem was that she forgot me. Because it was no longer a rush when she forgot me, I cannot say that the service was good. Except from that, everything else was okay.Score: 3.5/5Food: It was my first time coming back since the renovations, and my friend told me that the food was a bit different. Indeed, the menu changed, and prices went up, which was expected. My friend and I ordered the seafood ramyun, the dak ball and the bibimbap in a stone bowl. Honestly, I believe that the ramyun is not that different from the dried noodles we find in groceries. The dak ball (fried chicken with a sweet sauce) was really good, as always. And the bibimbap was good also. I highly recommend to pay the extra 1$ for the stone bowl, I find it way better.Score: 4/5Ambiance: The restaurant is really small and there is a screen playing KPOP MVs. In general, the ambiance is nice, but I prefer the way it was before the decoration, it simply felt a bit more cozy.Score: 3.5/5Good food, good service! The place is always packed but the noise level is perfectly acceptable. The bibimbap was one of the best I've had in Montreal. Cant speak to the rest. The mushrooms were cooked just right!The decor is the best best the ambiance is still there. K-Pop is playing in the background all the time. It is pretty cool. It can be cramped depending on where you are sitting. If you don't mind waiting in line for 20 minutes you will definitely enjoy your meal.My fiancé and I came to visit Montreal over Labor Day weekend coming from the U.S. and was craving for some ramen. We found this little Korean restaurant on yelp and wanted to give it a try. Here's my story on their service.My cousin and his girlfriend (which are both from the U.S. As well arrived there first and grabbed us a table since we were running behind since our hotel was a bit further away. The waitress was very kind and let them reserve a table while waiting for our arrival. We finally arrived and parked in the parking lot right next to the restaurant (which wasn't free). All I had on me was larger CAD $20 to pay for the parking machine when all I needed was CAD $7. I asked our waitress if it was possible to give us some change and she gladly helped. Thumbs up on great service. Now the review that people really care about.. Their food and beverage. I had the bulgogi ramyun and Korean Soda with milk flavor. The ramyun was delicious. Good portions of ramen noodles and meat. Enough to make you full and not making you leave feeling like a fat kid. The soda was okay. It was my first time trying it. Overall, everyone in my party enjoyed their meal. The environment was great as well with a younger crowd and also families. Ill definitely come back here whenever we are back in Canada.Eum, not sure if it's my poor choices or I'm just not a huge fan of korean food, but I've visited GaNaDaRa three times, picking three different dishes.On my first visit, I had the squid dub bap. I liked the taste and presentation, but after 5 spoonfuls, I felt like all the grease from the fried food (veggies and squid) was just too much --  I couldn't finish the plate. Also, I was disappointed that it was mostly fried carrots and rice with very few squid.The second time, I had the supreme poutine. Yes yes yes, you're gonna tell me i asked for it -- well it's too late now, but ordering poutine in an asian restaurant really wasn't a fantastic idea on hindsight: mixing kimchi, seafood, and rice cakes with cheese and fries must be the work of a maverick. Never in my life have I had so many contrasting flavors disagreeing with half the others in 1 dish. I noted the fries were particularly crispy on the outside, and fluffy on the inside. The grilled chicken and bugolgi were also very tasty. I didn't like the other ingredients. And so I came back a third time, for grilled chicken. This time, I got the dak dolsot bibimbap. The flavors were diverse and appropriately balanced, but it lacked salt. And more chicken would have been better.I'm still not an expert in Korean cuisine, but I'm rating this 4/5 for the helpful staff, generally decent food, and k-pop atmosphere. Do yourself a favor and not a Supreme Poutine.Great tasty food if you like asian fusion. And even if you're not a huge fan like me, try it!  The staff are so patient and helpful, I called to pick up an order really close to closing time and the lady explained every single thing I asked about without rushing me at all. And then she invited me to come in so that she would explain some more! I'm glad I did because I really didn't expect the place to look so clean and modern! It was a pleasant surprise. There's usually a line outside that's why I was tempted to try it and I'm glad I did. Everything was tasty, even the famous "seafood pancake" which I was a bit skeptical about. The portions are so big but why not?Definitely worth a try.I am so sad to give Ganadara a 2.5/5. After the renovation the consistency of the food has been a disappointment. I come to ganadara at least once every two weeks and I've tried almost everything on their menu. The poutine (favorite of mine), the portion is smaller, the sauce isnt as spicy, the sauce is runny, bland and boiled cabbage is added (which i think is one of the reasons why its bland). I found out the chef prepares it differently. Instead of reheating the sauce for every order, it is put in a slowcooker and poured on the fries when ordered.
