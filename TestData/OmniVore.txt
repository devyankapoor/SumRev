So happy that my wife and I gave omnivore a try this time around while in Montreal.  We were specifically looking for some Lebanese style cuisine - and we definitely chose well.  I had the Beirut kafta sandwich, she had the Inca.  The meats were super tender and very flavorful (the bags of charcoal can be seen lining some of the walls). The staff was also very friendly, which is a plus - it's probably the effect of smelling all the wonderful food all day.  Get a window seat and enjoy the awesome food!I wanted to eat something lighter after eating out for the whole day so I went to omnivore to get some hearty vegetarian options.  I ordered the Herbivore option and chose the cauliflower with cabbage, okra, and beets salad.  Each one was seasoned very differently and I didn't feel bad eating these because they felt very light and healthy, almost cleansing.  Loved it.  One mistake we made was that we forgot to get our food warmed up so we ate cold food on a cold night.  Oops.  Still no regrets!Great healthy food for great prices. Simply amazing!! The staff is incredible, they are all true gems.  The food is great quality and delicious! I still dream about their vegan wrap and make it a must when I'm in Montreal.  Even being mostly gluten free I will indulge here.  There hummus and baba ghanoush is perfect! The decor is magical, the plants make the place come alive.  One of my all time favourite spots. I can be pretty picky about my meat. . . but that charcoal goodness worked its magic! Sandwiches usually bore me to death but the concoction of veggies and meat that they place together were pretty nice on my taste buds.  The menu here definitely has a place for both vegetarians and meat lovers -- (staying true to the name of the restaurant!) This was probably my first encounter with Lebanese food and I have to say I was pretty impressed.  In terms of price point, it is pretty student budget friendly.  Most things seem to stay around the $10 - $15 range.  You get a tropical vibe from this place.  A lot of wooden decorations and greenery.  Very easy on the eye and homey. Freshly cooked grub in a cosy oasis on st.  Laurent.  I got the omnivore it came with good baba and better hummus.  I've had better beef but overall it was really good. First-timer recommendations: Arez for vegetarians and Roma for not. Fast and delicious always. Love this place! Picture a big tree house in the middle of an emerald green forest.  Omnivore would look exactly like the interior of that cabin.  Amazing and fresh Lebanese food.  I was recommended vegetables that I usually hate but now I'd love to have those as salads everyday.  Each element on my dish was so fresh and vibrant.  The tabbouleh was the best I've ever had.  Parsley was freshly green, the onions were crunchy, and the right amount of acidity came from the tomatoes and the lemon juice so it makes you want to chew the salad and suck all those juices out.  The service was also fast and friendly.  After finishing my meal I felt like I ate a super healthy and delicious meal which also made me feel good about myself.  I highly recommend this place. I came here for lunch today and it lived up to everything i had read.   We both had the omnivore plate with chicken and both the kofta and cumin chicken were full of flavour.  The hummus was some of the best i have tasted and the salad and lentil rice were great too.  If i was staying in Montreal longer i would be back frequently. It'a a delicious alternative to the fast food Lebanese we are used to (which is still very good). However, the portion size is small.  We have big appetites and one sandwich does nothing for us.  You need to order at least 3 sandwiches for 2 people unless you take a few side salads.  I would prefer paying more and having a bigger portion. Another downside. . .  They don't offer garlic potatoes, which I really enjoy with my Lebanese food. Nevertheless, the ingredients are of excellent quality and everything is delicious.  Be prepared to wait at least 10-15 minutes for your sandwiches as everything is cooked to order in the charcoal.   Service is very friendly. Enjoy!!Location: On the Main.  Street parking only. The place: It's tiny and for reasons unbeknownst to myself, it reminded me of a jungle shack.  Have I ever been to the jungle, you ask? No I have not but I'm sure that's what a jungle shack would look like.  Very cozy with lots of warm brown colors.  Also, the smell.  Nom nom nom.  All I'm going to say about that.  Oh, and great tunes in the background.  Anyone who plays Dylan is all right by me.  The food: Their specialty is Middle Eastern cuisine that they prepare fresh on a daily basis.  Their selling feature is that maple charcoal grill - it makes everything good and tasty! I ordered the fresh beet/apple/carrot juice and the Bombay wrap.  The juice was a great little energy boost, and I could really taste the beets and carrots.  The Bombay was to die for.  It consisted of grilled chicken with pineapple chutney, sumac onions and red cabbage cozily tucked into Pita bread.  AND it was so damn spicy I could feel my sinuses expanding as I ate.  LOVE it.  Flavor-wise, I would define this as an explosion of deliciousness.  Need I say more? Service: Great - the guy behind the counter is a little serious but he knows how to make a mean sandwich so I'll let that go.  The clerk who brought us water and rang us up at the cash was super friendly. Price point: Pretty good - for $10 I had the wrap and the juice. I don't give out 4 stars easily.  Especially with only 1 visit, but my sons loved it so much we had to order them another Carnivore platter that they devoured.  The service was great and efficient.  Most of the tables are set up for 4 people and one large table that could sit 8-10 pp, but I would't go there with that big of a party.  They also package the food well for take out and turn over is pretty good.  With Fall approaching great food to take on a picnic or outdoor performance.  My only complaint or wish is they add a Shawarma lamb platter to the menu, so if you travel to Montreal this is a must stop destination. This place is a Montreal staple - if you live here and haven't been, get your omnivore on NOW! The food is simple yet full of flavour.  It's quite affordable and has an ultra cool rustic garden inspired decor!It's small but cozy with a cafeteria style!I recommend the mango chutney and Hummus!Stunningly good snack food.  I got the fish sandwich, and it was really amazingly flavored.  The house lemonade has maybe mint in it? Totally delicious. This is definitely THE place to get food while wandering aimlessly along Saint-Laurent. Food is decent.  Had the omnivore salad, which was good, would have again.  They are not flexible when it comes to payment.  Wasn't too happy about that. good little place to fill you up without too much guilt, its exotic and fresh but not so much authentic i guess its a fusion place that always gets compared to how a real kabab should taste like for the originality i give it a 3/5One of my favorite place in Montréal.  Food is so good and people are very nice !I had the Inca "sandwich".    I say "sandwich", but it is really a "wrap" of sorts.   Well, call it a sandwich or call it a wrap, but whatever it is it was phenomenal.     The mix of flavors along with a perfect texture and feel, just made we want to say "oooh that is good" with every single bite that I took. I didn't try anything else, but the Inca get's 5 stars!I was craving vegetables after too many days of bagels, croissants, and poutine.  Omnivore was the perfect place to satiate that desire and I also had the chance to walk down memory lane (but it was even better than the original) with a fabulously garlicky, satisfyingly crunchy (thank you, turnips) shish taouk sandwich.  As so many others have said, the menu is set up very well so that you can include some vegetable and some meat options, add in some fragrant, soothing mint tea and you will be very happy at the end of the meal.  We were a group of five and so decided to to order the plate of 5 vegetarian mezza for $10.  It was well worth it as we had a heaping platter of hummus, lentil-studded rice, moussaka, sweet potatoes, and orzo tossed with toasted pine nuts and dried cranberries.  Supple triangles of pita were served alongside and I quickly stacked mine with all the veggies that I could cram inside.  Bliss.  On to the kafta sandwiches: the Djaj is a "Classique" version of Shish Taouk except that it's a longer, thinner presentation and the quality is much higher than at the storefronts I frequented on St.  Laurent in the mid-1990s.  Ouch.  It hurt to so blatantly acknowledge the passing of time.  But I'm eating better food now, right? That must count for something.  I also tried the Inca, which again involves chicken but also some crunchy tahini-laced cabbage.  Star of the sandwich right there.  There were so many options that I wanted to try - I will return!I am going to be upfront with you, this place melts my heart, makes me feel warm inside, had me fall in love.  Had to leave because it felt THAT good.  I actually think about this cozy eatery, thought about it about all the way back to NY.   I suppose you want to hear about the food?  Fine, I will tell you first. . . . I am Lebanese through and through AND from Beirut so when you come to my house half of Omnivore's menu is served by Mama herself.   It'll make your soul sing BUT this Montreal Middle Eastern joint will make you get up and preach, speak in tongues.   This is it folks, it's all the things food SHOULD be.   Authentic, rich & balanced on the palette, Kefta spooning with a pickle, snug tight with a fresh-made pita and the slightest bit of garlic aroma fills your nose and takes you to that hot Beiruti night on an apartment balcony.   Laffa in hand and a smile on your face.   If you come to Montreal and you don't stop by you are truly a fool. Good food - but outrageously slow!!So happy that my wife and I gave omnivore a try this time around while in Montreal.

It'a a delicious alternative to the fast food Lebanese we are used to (which is still very good). However, the portion size is small.  We have big appetites and one sandwich does nothing for us.  You need to order at least 3 sandwiches for 2 people unless you take a few side salads.  I would prefer paying more and having a bigger portion. Another downside. . .  They don't offer garlic potatoes, which I really enjoy with my Lebanese food. Nevertheless, the ingredients are of excellent quality and everything is delicious.  Be prepared to wait at least 10-15 minutes for your sandwiches as everything is cooked to order in the charcoal.   Service is very friendly. Enjoy!!Location: On the Main.  Street parking only. The place: It's tiny and for reasons unbeknownst to myself, it reminded me of a jungle shack.  Have I ever been to the jungle, you ask? No I have not but I'm sure that's what a jungle shack would look like.  Very cozy with lots of warm brown colors.  Also, the smell.  Nom nom nom.  All I'm going to say about that.  Oh, and great tunes in the background.  Anyone who plays Dylan is all right by me.  The food: Their specialty is Middle Eastern cuisine that they prepare fresh on a daily basis.  Their selling feature is that maple charcoal grill - it makes everything good and tasty! I ordered the fresh beet/apple/carrot juice and the Bombay wrap.  The juice was a great little energy boost, and I could really taste the beets and carrots.  The Bombay was to die for.  It consisted of grilled chicken with pineapple chutney, sumac onions and red cabbage cozily tucked into Pita bread.  AND it was so damn spicy I could feel my sinuses expanding as I ate.  LOVE it.  Flavor-wise, I would define this as an explosion of deliciousness.  Need I say more? Service: Great - the guy behind the counter is a little serious but he knows how to make a mean sandwich so I'll let that go.  The clerk who brought us water and rang us up at the cash was super friendly. Price point: Pretty good - for $10 I had the wrap and the juice. I don't give out 4 stars easily.  Especially with only 1 visit, but my sons loved it so much we had to order them another Carnivore platter that they devoured.  The service was great and efficient.  Most of the tables are set up for 4 people and one large table that could sit 8-10 pp, but I would't go there with that big of a party.  They also package the food well for take out and turn over is pretty good.  With Fall approaching great food to take on a picnic or outdoor performance.  My only complaint or wish is they add a Shawarma lamb platter to the menu, so if you travel to Montreal this is a must stop destination. This place is a Montreal staple - if you live here and haven't been, get your omnivore on NOW! The food is simple yet full of flavour.  It's quite affordable and has an ultra cool rustic garden inspired decor!It's small but cozy with a cafeteria style!I recommend the mango chutney and Hummus!Stunningly good snack food.  I got the fish sandwich, and it was really amazingly flavored.  The house lemonade has maybe mint in it? Totally delicious. This is definitely THE place to get food while wandering aimlessly along Saint-Laurent. Food is decent.  Had the omnivore salad, which was good, would have again.  They are not flexible when it comes to payment.  Wasn't too happy about that. good little place to fill you up without too much guilt, its exotic and fresh but not so much authentic i guess its a fusion place that always gets compared to how a real kabab should taste like for the originality i give it a 3/5One of my favorite place in Montréal.  Food is so good and people are very nice !I had the Inca "sandwich".    I say "sandwich", but it is really a "wrap" of sorts.   Well, call it a sandwich or call it a wrap, but whatever it is it was phenomenal.     The mix of flavors along with a perfect texture and feel, just made we want to say "oooh that is good" with every single bite that I took. I didn't try anything else, but the Inca get's 5 stars!I was craving vegetables after too many days of bagels, croissants, and poutine.  Omnivore was the perfect place to satiate that desire and I also had the chance to walk down memory lane (but it was even better than the original) with a fabulously garlicky, satisfyingly crunchy (thank you, turnips) shish taouk sandwich.  As so many others have said, the menu is set up very well so that you can include some vegetable and some meat options, add in some fragrant, soothing mint tea and you will be very happy at the end of the meal.  We were a group of five and so decided to to order the plate of 5 vegetarian mezza for $10.  It was well worth it as we had a heaping platter of hummus, lentil-studded rice, moussaka, sweet potatoes, and orzo tossed with toasted pine nuts and dried cranberries.  Supple triangles of pita were served alongside and I quickly stacked mine with all the veggies that I could cram inside.  Bliss.  On to the kafta sandwiches: the Djaj is a "Classique" version of Shish Taouk except that it's a longer, thinner presentation and the quality is much higher than at the storefronts I frequented on St.  Laurent in the mid-1990s.  Ouch.  It hurt to so blatantly acknowledge the passing of time.  But I'm eating better food now, right? That must count for something.  I also tried the Inca, which again involves chicken but also some crunchy tahini-laced cabbage.  Star of the sandwich right there.  There were so many options that I wanted to try - I will return!I am going to be upfront with you, this place melts my heart, makes me feel warm inside, had me fall in love.  Had to leave because it felt THAT good.  I actually think about this cozy eatery, thought about it about all the way back to NY.   I suppose you want to hear about the food?  Fine, I will tell you first. . . . I am Lebanese through and through AND from Beirut so when you come to my house half of Omnivore's menu is served by Mama herself.   It'll make your soul sing BUT this Montreal Middle Eastern joint will make you get up and preach, speak in tongues.   This is it folks, it's all the things food SHOULD be.   Authentic, rich & balanced on the palette, Kefta spooning with a pickle, snug tight with a fresh-made pita and the slightest bit of garlic aroma fills your nose and takes you to that hot Beiruti night on an apartment balcony.   Laffa in hand and a smile on your face.   If you come to Montreal and you don't stop by you are truly a fool. Good food - but outrageously slow!!
