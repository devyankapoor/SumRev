I was confused as to how so many Montreal restaurants get near perfect ratings but I think I understand why.  They really do deliver! not just because the people there are so nice!Although we did wait in the cold on a Saturday morning for around 1. 5 hours, I can assure you that the food is worth the wait.  The eggs bennies are poaches to perfection and the hollandaise sauce is so smooth and creamy.  It's pure heaven on a plate.  The potatoes are seasoned nicely and everything just goes together really well.  It was the best brunch I have eaten.  There are ones in New York that are comparable but I would say that the flavours are not as "full of life", if that makes sense.  It's fresh but still extremely satisfying.  I think I'm going here each time I go to Montreal!Wait? What wait? So let me start by saying: expect to wait.  For like, an hour and a half.  Outside.  In the elements.  Now let me continue by saying, once you do make it inside, and that food touches your lips. . .  I swear it's sprinkled with mermaid kisses and instant amnesia dust.  That wait because ancient history.  I went with a group of about 8 for a friend of mines birthday (that was actually the entire reason I was in Montreal to begin with) and we found this place on Yelp! We already knew about the long line so we decided to take it in shifts.  A few people would wait while the rest would wonder and explore.  So we make it inside after waiting for a little over an hour, and wait a pleasant surprise.  The decor is super fun, colorful, and full of American satire.  The menu, like most things in Montreal is in French but the waitress, Elise I believe her name was, she was a doll! She explained and translated everything.  Everyone on my party ordered different variations of the egg Benedict.  I have never tasted something so delicious and flavorful yep beautiful for breakfast/brunch ever.  We went on to enjoy or food and two bottles of champagne we ordered for mimosas.  I'm going to assume Elise overheard our convo about the birthday celebration because at the end of the meal she brought out a complimentary round of shots! What a sweetie! This place was amazing! The food was ridiculously delicious, the service was impeccable, and the setting was trendy yet cozy.  If I lived in the area or visit Montreal again I will absolutely going back.  ps.  The bathrooms are crazy trippy!The.  Best.  Breakfast.   I used Yelp to locate the best place for a birthday brunch and L'Avenue was the number one hit.   Every review recommends an EARLY arrival on the weekends, and I can confirm that arriving before 10am on a Saturday is the best route for fast seating (ask to be in the back away from the door/draft!).   Quirky hipster ambiance (with suspended bicycles and massive maple syrup canisters) will make you feel like you're one of the cool kids.   Professional nom-worthy menu (with benedicts and waffles and omelets) will make you feel like one of the fat kids (in a good way). Order up an adult milkshake (with boooooooooooze) then tuck in and get ready to let your pants out.   The homefries: perfectly seasoned.   The waffle with nutella: what dreams are made of.   The omelet: large enough to feed a small family.   It's a large menu with something for everyone and prices that won't break the bank. Whatever you do. . . . . . go to the bathroom.   The coolest pee experience you'll ever have (unless you've used those one-way-mirror public potties. . . . in which case this will be the SECOND best pee experience!).   No more hints. . . . . just enjoy. . . . Usually when you see incredible long line outside a restaurant you tell yourself "ok this is the new hype" but this is place is the exception.  People are standing outside in line even in winter and its not for nothing. The food is outstanding, huge portions (I always split with my wife and we both are full at the end) and the quality is outstanding.  I gave it a 4 star and not 5 only because the long lines take some out of the experience.  Try the amazing natural shakes, out of this world egg benedicts and outstanding pancakes.  This is the place for brunch in Montreal. Came here for brunch while visiting Montréal after looking on Yelp.  This place had one of the highest reviews.  We got in line just in time before it got too crazy (before 10am).  The menu was in french only, so I brushed up on some of my high school french to make out what was on the menu.  The decor in the restaurant was unique.  They gave us a fruit "appetizer" which resembled a fruit kabob.  It was good.  We got one of their mixed fruity drinks/smoothie, which tasted good but nothing memorable.  I liked that their water was watermelon infused, it tasted refreshing.  *Disclaimer* I think I'm a little spoiled since there are many fantastic brunch places in Philly.  I had a very tasty french toast topped with fresh fruit! One of us got the cappuccino which was rich and came with a small piece of chocolate.  We ordered  several savory brunch dishes which was good but again nothing too memorable.  The service was just okay.  I think one of the most memorable things was strangely their blue lit creepy bathroom.  We saw several people go in at once to take pictures.  It was unique. . .  but again slightly creepy.  Despite not being too impressed, I had a decent experience.  I will probably not come back again since I don't regularly visit Montréal.  If I come back, I will probably explore some other brunch places in the area. Fantastic restaurant!!! My friend and I visited there around 9:30 am.  There was a line up outside, but luckily we only waited for 15 mins to have a seat.  The menu's design was interesting and the waitress provided us an English one.  We asked if we can order only one smoked salmon Benedict eggs to share.  The staff was really nice and told us they can help to separate the food into two parts and both of us can have fruit and fries by adding only 2$.  We certainly say YES.  When the food coming into our table, we felt so   satisfied because it looked so gooood!!The hollandaise sauce was very creamy, the egg was boiled perfectly, fruits were sweet and fresh, fries were not greasy.  Everything was delicious. Oh! BTW, even their washroom is awesome too.  Fluorescent painting on the wall~ Best breakfast made our Montreal to a perfection!Best breakfast food ever. Omelets , panacakes, there were 4 of us and we couldnt even get up to leave. Oh.  My.  God.  Yum.  I went here on a Thursday for brunch with a friend and the reviews were right, this place is amazing.  The waiter explained how they really put an emphasis on ensuring the best quality food, and this showed when we got our food.  I arrived before my friend and was worried I would have to wait for her before I could get seated (there was only one couple in front of me when I arrived) but I asked the waiter and he said I didn't have to wait and seated me right by the window.  He was very friendly and helpful.  I had the French toast with bananas caramelized in captain Morgan rum, with Nutella and a sauce (which a believe had rum also) with real pieces of coconut on top.  The flavors went so well together and weren't overly sweet tasting.  The portion size was big, I wasn't able to finish my plate.  I was surprised this place was even able to accommodate my friend who has so many restrictions (doesn't eat gluten, vegetarian, and lactose intolerant).  She ordered the eggs Benedict with all vegetables, substituted the English muffins for portobello mushrooms ($2 charge) and swapped out her potatoes for a salad ($1 charge).  I had read someone's review saying the bathrooms will give you nightmares, so of course I had to check them out, and they're awesome.  There was a lot of water on the floor though :/ I will definitely be back here.  I'd suggest going on a weekday before 11am to avoid a huge lineup. Canadian brunchBagels can be got laterNow benedict timeI did my very best in Montreal to make sure every meal was a 5 star meal, and this brunch was no exception.  Show up early for a seat, the line goes out the door.  We were right on time to be seated as a party of 8, and we were treated awesomely.  The duck benedict, salmon benedict, gluten-free pancake, omelettes, coffee, smoothies, all incredible.  If you're looking for a great local brunch spot, this place is worth the distance traveled.  Also, the bathroom is absolutely terrifying. Je suis triste -  I wish L'Avenue was in Toronto.   We came here at around 10:30am, arriving to a lineup of roughly 8-10 people ahead of us, which moved relatively quickly (maybe a 15 minute wait, at max?).   Appreciated that despite the short wait, there's a cooler with ice water available at the front of the line for any overheated guests waiting for a table.  Which takes me to the next point: seemingly superfluous details are far from lost.   Himalayan pink salt sits in the table salt shakers instead of regular ol' stinky salt.   Water inside comes from a huge, clear plastic cube dispenser, with whole rounds of watermelon floating inside to flavour the water.   Cafe latte glacee, which I thought would simply be caffe latte poured over ice, actually came in a large glass and blended, like an iced capp but much less sweet.  A free skewer of fresh fruit will serve as your appetizer, regardless of whatever dish you might've ordered.  My pick for the day was the eggs Benedict "Tout L'Monde a Poele": Two huge mounds of sautéed mushrooms, bacon on English muffins topped with two poached eggs.  Sadly, a couple of our eggs were overcooked.  The hubs had the eggs Benedict with the truffle. . . before I ate the tiny bit of black truffle shavings on top, because I'm a monster like that.   The hollandaise, while I have to admit wasn't the best I've had, was also not the worst - it actually tasted of butter.  Both bennys were delicious.  My tips:- Menus are in French, I'm not sure whether or not they have English menus available.   If this puts you off, I suggest reading their menu online so you can Google in advance.  - If French is not your forte, when greeted by waitstaff, make sure you reply in English.   If you answer in French, be prepared to speak French the rest of the time you're there.  - Come early-ish! Pretty much anything past 11 and you're in line for the long haul.  Portions are large, so warm up your belly before you come here.   Bon appetit!Ahhhhhhmazing!! Is all I can say.  Best salmon egg benedict I've ever had.  They give you fruit to start with, which was very lovely and delicious! Great way to start the day.  My friend and I were visiting Montréal from Massachusetts and we stumbled upon this place on Yelp.  Saw the reviews and needed to go! Be aware that you will most likely wait in a line, but if you're with one or two people you can get in sooner.  The menu is in all French (had to google translate some stuff) but the waitress helped us find what we wanted.  My friend got the Idaho omelette and she said it was the most intricate omelette she ever had haha so many flavors and ingredients!! I got the salmon benedict and almost died.  Literally.  It was so good!! The hash browns are home made, too and they put some seasoning in it that will make you want more.  This place is the spot for breakfast/brunch!!This was the last establishment that my friends and I had hit up prior to our long drive back to NYC.  We had thought about eating here earlier, but was scared off by the super long queues the day prior.  We figured there wouldn't be as long of a wait on a Monday morning, and we were right.  We were seated almost immediately upon reaching the restaurant. Aside from the eclectic decor, the menu offers plenty of different options to suit most palates.  I got their truffled mushroom omelette, which I thought erred a little on the bland side, though the mushrooms themselves were delicious.  The potatoes that came with my dish were also good, but at this point in my trip, I kind of never wanted to see another potato again.  Portions were gargantuan so I definitely felt like I got my money's worth, but I thought the food would've been jaw-droppingly awesome considering how long the queues had been just the day before, and presumably every weekend.  I'm not sure I would've waited for more than half an hour for the meal I had been served, to be quite honest, so I was especially glad that I didn't have to wait when we actually ate here. Service was excellent, though, and the bathrooms were also quite interesting.  Oh, and every entree comes with fruit skewers and watermelon flavored water.  3. 5 stars, really. Amazing benedict on French toast! Staff are attentive and friendly.  Smoothies are at good value!Loved the decor in this restaurant- it was retro with graffiti/art all over the walls and a motorcycle hanging above our heads.  We waited over an hour (as expected) to get a table here.  Luckily the weather was beautiful, and they had free fresh lemonade for anyone in line.  The space was a little cramped, and once we were seated, we still had to wait for menus since they didn't have enough. I had very high expectations for the food because everyone raved about it being the best brunch spot in Montreal.  My bf and I shared a smoothie, which was okay, but it had too much raspberry flavor, and I didn't taste whatever else the waitress described it having (supposedly strawberry, basil, etc).  What was nice though is that they give you a free plate of fruit on a skewer.  I got the steak and eggs benedict with potatoes.  The potatoes were probably the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had- they were cooked perfectly and had a hint of salty and sweet flavor to them.  For my steak and eggs (and mushrooms) benedict, it was delicious.  However, my poached eggs were overcooked and they didn't ooze out like they were supposed to.  This was a little disappointing, but overall I still enjoyed my meal here. Decor is fun, hip and trendy.  The restaurant has a laid back vibe and from what I saw, seems to always draw a large crowd.  My boyfriend got the steak and eggs and I got the veggie omelette.  Both dishes were good, nothing outstanding but the restaurant is worth checking out for travelers.  And be sure to take a look at the bathroom!With the waiting time outside, the cold, and the long ass line of people, my patience and my expectations was really really high.  After 45min of waiting, finally a seat.  But HOLY MOTHER OF GOD.  Probably the best brunch I had.  Quality is high as hell, flavour are perfectly mix, top presentation, nice ambiance, i wish I had something bad to say but can't find any.  45min? 30 min of wait? Go for it.  You won't regret it. BEST EGGS BENEDICT EVER. The line outside the door at around 10:30 am was pretty long; I'd say we waited maybe 20-30 minutes? The longer I waited, the higher my standards were for this place, to be honest! The ambiance is pretty interesting--a floating motorcycle above one table, a colorful mannequin at the window, and the whole place seemed to rely mostly on sunlight from the windows.  My boyfriend has been here before and he recommended that I get the steak and mushroom benedict.  I did, and we also got complimentary assorted fruits on a skewer.  The water tasted strange, and we assumed it was maybe infused with fruit before hand or something, but it wasn't bad.  When my eggs benedict came out, it smelled AMAZING.  At both ends of the plate were sliced English muffins, with the eggs benedict on top and the tender steak and mushrooms topped everything else (it also had its own type of gravy, which mixed in with the hollandaise sauce).  In the middle of the plate was a small cup of roasted potatoes.  First bite I took, I tried tasting the egg, muffin, a piece of steak and a piece of mushroom simultaneously and I couldn't keep up a conversation with our friends--THE FOOD WAS JUST TOO GOOD and I wanted to endure every chew.  The hollandaise sauce was so unique to me because it didn't taste so bland, and having it be mixed with the tangy gravy sauce that accompanied the steak made the whole forkful even better.  The wait was worth it.  The service is great.  The food is better.  I am at a loss for words at how outstanding my meal was.  A must-visit for ALL tourists!Staff&service 4 / 5  food 4 / 5 decor 4 / 5 I get why there's a big hype for tourists. . the decor is cool, the menus are funky looking and the combinations of food are odd but tasty.  However the lineups are long and the time to get the menus is long too.  If you're visiting montreal I recommend it but if you are from the area don't bother, go somewhere else. In Montreal for the week with family.  We decided to get some breakfast and looked this place up.  I ordered the Classic Eggs Benedict which was amazing.  The service was also great since we didn't really speak French that well and they were extremely helpful!Always. . . totally worth it! Dress warm from October on cuz its at least 20 minutes wait outside!I was confused as to how so many Montreal restaurants get near perfect ratings but I think I understand why.  They really do deliver! not just because the people there are so nice!Although we did wait in the cold on a Saturday morning for around 1. 5 hours, I can assure you that the food is worth the wait.

A must-visit for ALL tourists!Staff&service 4 / 5  food 4 / 5 decor 4 / 5 I get why there's a big hype for tourists. . the decor is cool, the menus are funky looking and the combinations of food are odd but tasty.  However the lineups are long and the time to get the menus is long too.  If you're visiting montreal I recommend it but if you are from the area don't bother, go somewhere else. In Montreal for the week with family.  We decided to get some breakfast and looked this place up.  I ordered the Classic Eggs Benedict which was amazing.  The service was also great since we didn't really speak French that well and they were extremely helpful!Always. . . totally worth it! Dress warm from October on cuz its at least 20 minutes wait outside!I was confused as to how so many Montreal restaurants get near perfect ratings but I think I understand why.  They really do deliver! not just because the people there are so nice!Although we did wait in the cold on a Saturday morning for around 1. 5 hours, I can assure you that the food is worth the wait.  The eggs bennies are poaches to perfection and the hollandaise sauce is so smooth and creamy.  It's pure heaven on a plate.  The potatoes are seasoned nicely and everything just goes together really well.  It was the best brunch I have eaten.  There are ones in New York that are comparable but I would say that the flavours are not as "full of life", if that makes sense.  It's fresh but still extremely satisfying.  I think I'm going here each time I go to Montreal!Wait? What wait? So let me start by saying: expect to wait.  For like, an hour and a half.  Outside.  In the elements.  Now let me continue by saying, once you do make it inside, and that food touches your lips. . .  I swear it's sprinkled with mermaid kisses and instant amnesia dust.  That wait because ancient history.  I went with a group of about 8 for a friend of mines birthday (that was actually the entire reason I was in Montreal to begin with) and we found this place on Yelp! We already knew about the long line so we decided to take it in shifts.  A few people would wait while the rest would wonder and explore.  So we make it inside after waiting for a little over an hour, and wait a pleasant surprise.  The decor is super fun, colorful, and full of American satire.  The menu, like most things in Montreal is in French but the waitress, Elise I believe her name was, she was a doll! She explained and translated everything.  Everyone on my party ordered different variations of the egg Benedict.  I have never tasted something so delicious and flavorful yep beautiful for breakfast/brunch ever.  We went on to enjoy or food and two bottles of champagne we ordered for mimosas.  I'm going to assume Elise overheard our convo about the birthday celebration because at the end of the meal she brought out a complimentary round of shots! What a sweetie! This place was amazing! The food was ridiculously delicious, the service was impeccable, and the setting was trendy yet cozy.  If I lived in the area or visit Montreal again I will absolutely going back.  ps.  The bathrooms are crazy trippy!The.  Best.  Breakfast.   I used Yelp to locate the best place for a birthday brunch and L'Avenue was the number one hit.   Every review recommends an EARLY arrival on the weekends, and I can confirm that arriving before 10am on a Saturday is the best route for fast seating (ask to be in the back away from the door/draft!).   Quirky hipster ambiance (with suspended bicycles and massive maple syrup canisters) will make you feel like you're one of the cool kids.   Professional nom-worthy menu (with benedicts and waffles and omelets) will make you feel like one of the fat kids (in a good way). Order up an adult milkshake (with boooooooooooze) then tuck in and get ready to let your pants out.   The homefries: perfectly seasoned.   The waffle with nutella: what dreams are made of.   The omelet: large enough to feed a small family.   It's a large menu with something for everyone and prices that won't break the bank. Whatever you do. . . . . . go to the bathroom.   The coolest pee experience you'll ever have (unless you've used those one-way-mirror public potties. . . . in which case this will be the SECOND best pee experience!).   No more hints. . . . . just enjoy. . . . Usually when you see incredible long line outside a restaurant you tell yourself "ok this is the new hype" but this is place is the exception.  People are standing outside in line even in winter and its not for nothing. The food is outstanding, huge portions (I always split with my wife and we both are full at the end) and the quality is outstanding.  I gave it a 4 star and not 5 only because the long lines take some out of the experience.  Try the amazing natural shakes, out of this world egg benedicts and outstanding pancakes.  This is the place for brunch in Montreal. Came here for brunch while visiting Montréal after looking on Yelp.  This place had one of the highest reviews.  We got in line just in time before it got too crazy (before 10am).  The menu was in french only, so I brushed up on some of my high school french to make out what was on the menu.  The decor in the restaurant was unique.  They gave us a fruit "appetizer" which resembled a fruit kabob.  It was good.  We got one of their mixed fruity drinks/smoothie, which tasted good but nothing memorable.  I liked that their water was watermelon infused, it tasted refreshing.  *Disclaimer* I think I'm a little spoiled since there are many fantastic brunch places in Philly.  I had a very tasty french toast topped with fresh fruit! One of us got the cappuccino which was rich and came with a small piece of chocolate.  We ordered  several savory brunch dishes which was good but again nothing too memorable.  The service was just okay.  I think one of the most memorable things was strangely their blue lit creepy bathroom.  We saw several people go in at once to take pictures.  It was unique. . .  but again slightly creepy.  Despite not being too impressed, I had a decent experience.  I will probably not come back again since I don't regularly visit Montréal.  If I come back, I will probably explore some other brunch places in the area. Fantastic restaurant!!! My friend and I visited there around 9:30 am.  There was a line up outside, but luckily we only waited for 15 mins to have a seat.  The menu's design was interesting and the waitress provided us an English one.  We asked if we can order only one smoked salmon Benedict eggs to share.  The staff was really nice and told us they can help to separate the food into two parts and both of us can have fruit and fries by adding only 2$.  We certainly say YES.  When the food coming into our table, we felt so   satisfied because it looked so gooood!!The hollandaise sauce was very creamy, the egg was boiled perfectly, fruits were sweet and fresh, fries were not greasy.  Everything was delicious. Oh! BTW, even their washroom is awesome too.  Fluorescent painting on the wall~ Best breakfast made our Montreal to a perfection!Best breakfast food ever. Omelets , panacakes, there were 4 of us and we couldnt even get up to leave. Oh.  My.  God.  Yum.  I went here on a Thursday for brunch with a friend and the reviews were right, this place is amazing.  The waiter explained how they really put an emphasis on ensuring the best quality food, and this showed when we got our food.  I arrived before my friend and was worried I would have to wait for her before I could get seated (there was only one couple in front of me when I arrived) but I asked the waiter and he said I didn't have to wait and seated me right by the window.  He was very friendly and helpful.  I had the French toast with bananas caramelized in captain Morgan rum, with Nutella and a sauce (which a believe had rum also) with real pieces of coconut on top.  The flavors went so well together and weren't overly sweet tasting.  The portion size was big, I wasn't able to finish my plate.  I was surprised this place was even able to accommodate my friend who has so many restrictions (doesn't eat gluten, vegetarian, and lactose intolerant).  She ordered the eggs Benedict with all vegetables, substituted the English muffins for portobello mushrooms ($2 charge) and swapped out her potatoes for a salad ($1 charge).  I had read someone's review saying the bathrooms will give you nightmares, so of course I had to check them out, and they're awesome.  There was a lot of water on the floor though :/ I will definitely be back here.  I'd suggest going on a weekday before 11am to avoid a huge lineup. Canadian brunchBagels can be got laterNow benedict timeI did my very best in Montreal to make sure every meal was a 5 star meal, and this brunch was no exception.  Show up early for a seat, the line goes out the door.  We were right on time to be seated as a party of 8, and we were treated awesomely.  The duck benedict, salmon benedict, gluten-free pancake, omelettes, coffee, smoothies, all incredible.  If you're looking for a great local brunch spot, this place is worth the distance traveled.  Also, the bathroom is absolutely terrifying. Je suis triste -  I wish L'Avenue was in Toronto.   We came here at around 10:30am, arriving to a lineup of roughly 8-10 people ahead of us, which moved relatively quickly (maybe a 15 minute wait, at max?).   Appreciated that despite the short wait, there's a cooler with ice water available at the front of the line for any overheated guests waiting for a table.  Which takes me to the next point: seemingly superfluous details are far from lost.   Himalayan pink salt sits in the table salt shakers instead of regular ol' stinky salt.   Water inside comes from a huge, clear plastic cube dispenser, with whole rounds of watermelon floating inside to flavour the water.   Cafe latte glacee, which I thought would simply be caffe latte poured over ice, actually came in a large glass and blended, like an iced capp but much less sweet.  A free skewer of fresh fruit will serve as your appetizer, regardless of whatever dish you might've ordered.  My pick for the day was the eggs Benedict "Tout L'Monde a Poele": Two huge mounds of sautéed mushrooms, bacon on English muffins topped with two poached eggs.  Sadly, a couple of our eggs were overcooked.  The hubs had the eggs Benedict with the truffle. . . before I ate the tiny bit of black truffle shavings on top, because I'm a monster like that.   The hollandaise, while I have to admit wasn't the best I've had, was also not the worst - it actually tasted of butter.  Both bennys were delicious.  My tips:- Menus are in French, I'm not sure whether or not they have English menus available.   If this puts you off, I suggest reading their menu online so you can Google in advance.  - If French is not your forte, when greeted by waitstaff, make sure you reply in English.   If you answer in French, be prepared to speak French the rest of the time you're there.  - Come early-ish! Pretty much anything past 11 and you're in line for the long haul.  Portions are large, so warm up your belly before you come here.   Bon appetit!Ahhhhhhmazing!! Is all I can say.  Best salmon egg benedict I've ever had.  They give you fruit to start with, which was very lovely and delicious! Great way to start the day.  My friend and I were visiting Montréal from Massachusetts and we stumbled upon this place on Yelp.  Saw the reviews and needed to go! Be aware that you will most likely wait in a line, but if you're with one or two people you can get in sooner.  The menu is in all French (had to google translate some stuff) but the waitress helped us find what we wanted.  My friend got the Idaho omelette and she said it was the most intricate omelette she ever had haha so many flavors and ingredients!! I got the salmon benedict and almost died.  Literally.  It was so good!! The hash browns are home made, too and they put some seasoning in it that will make you want more.  This place is the spot for breakfast/brunch!!This was the last establishment that my friends and I had hit up prior to our long drive back to NYC.  We had thought about eating here earlier, but was scared off by the super long queues the day prior.  We figured there wouldn't be as long of a wait on a Monday morning, and we were right.  We were seated almost immediately upon reaching the restaurant. Aside from the eclectic decor, the menu offers plenty of different options to suit most palates.  I got their truffled mushroom omelette, which I thought erred a little on the bland side, though the mushrooms themselves were delicious.  The potatoes that came with my dish were also good, but at this point in my trip, I kind of never wanted to see another potato again.  Portions were gargantuan so I definitely felt like I got my money's worth, but I thought the food would've been jaw-droppingly awesome considering how long the queues had been just the day before, and presumably every weekend.  I'm not sure I would've waited for more than half an hour for the meal I had been served, to be quite honest, so I was especially glad that I didn't have to wait when we actually ate here. Service was excellent, though, and the bathrooms were also quite interesting.  Oh, and every entree comes with fruit skewers and watermelon flavored water.  3. 5 stars, really. Amazing benedict on French toast! Staff are attentive and friendly.  Smoothies are at good value!Loved the decor in this restaurant- it was retro with graffiti/art all over the walls and a motorcycle hanging above our heads.  We waited over an hour (as expected) to get a table here.  Luckily the weather was beautiful, and they had free fresh lemonade for anyone in line.  The space was a little cramped, and once we were seated, we still had to wait for menus since they didn't have enough. I had very high expectations for the food because everyone raved about it being the best brunch spot in Montreal.  My bf and I shared a smoothie, which was okay, but it had too much raspberry flavor, and I didn't taste whatever else the waitress described it having (supposedly strawberry, basil, etc).  What was nice though is that they give you a free plate of fruit on a skewer.  I got the steak and eggs benedict with potatoes.  The potatoes were probably the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had- they were cooked perfectly and had a hint of salty and sweet flavor to them.  For my steak and eggs (and mushrooms) benedict, it was delicious.  However, my poached eggs were overcooked and they didn't ooze out like they were supposed to.  This was a little disappointing, but overall I still enjoyed my meal here. Decor is fun, hip and trendy.  The restaurant has a laid back vibe and from what I saw, seems to always draw a large crowd.  My boyfriend got the steak and eggs and I got the veggie omelette.  Both dishes were good, nothing outstanding but the restaurant is worth checking out for travelers.  And be sure to take a look at the bathroom!With the waiting time outside, the cold, and the long ass line of people, my patience and my expectations was really really high.  After 45min of waiting, finally a seat.  But HOLY MOTHER OF GOD.  Probably the best brunch I had.  Quality is high as hell, flavour are perfectly mix, top presentation, nice ambiance, i wish I had something bad to say but can't find any.  45min? 30 min of wait? Go for it.  You won't regret it. BEST EGGS BENEDICT EVER. The line outside the door at around 10:30 am was pretty long; I'd say we waited maybe 20-30 minutes? The longer I waited, the higher my standards were for this place, to be honest! The ambiance is pretty interesting--a floating motorcycle above one table, a colorful mannequin at the window, and the whole place seemed to rely mostly on sunlight from the windows.  My boyfriend has been here before and he recommended that I get the steak and mushroom benedict.  I did, and we also got complimentary assorted fruits on a skewer.  The water tasted strange, and we assumed it was maybe infused with fruit before hand or something, but it wasn't bad.  When my eggs benedict came out, it smelled AMAZING.  At both ends of the plate were sliced English muffins, with the eggs benedict on top and the tender steak and mushrooms topped everything else (it also had its own type of gravy, which mixed in with the hollandaise sauce).  In the middle of the plate was a small cup of roasted potatoes.  First bite I took, I tried tasting the egg, muffin, a piece of steak and a piece of mushroom simultaneously and I couldn't keep up a conversation with our friends--THE FOOD WAS JUST TOO GOOD and I wanted to endure every chew.  The hollandaise sauce was so unique to me because it didn't taste so bland, and having it be mixed with the tangy gravy sauce that accompanied the steak made the whole forkful even better.  The wait was worth it.  The service is great.  The food is better.  I am at a loss for words at how outstanding my meal was.

The water tasted strange, and we assumed it was maybe infused with fruit before hand or something, but it wasn't bad.  When my eggs benedict came out, it smelled AMAZING.  At both ends of the plate were sliced English muffins, with the eggs benedict on top and the tender steak and mushrooms topped everything else (it also had its own type of gravy, which mixed in with the hollandaise sauce).  In the middle of the plate was a small cup of roasted potatoes.  First bite I took, I tried tasting the egg, muffin, a piece of steak and a piece of mushroom simultaneously and I couldn't keep up a conversation with our friends--THE FOOD WAS JUST TOO GOOD and I wanted to endure every chew.  The hollandaise sauce was so unique to me because it didn't taste so bland, and having it be mixed with the tangy gravy sauce that accompanied the steak made the whole forkful even better.  The wait was worth it.  The service is great.  The food is better.  I am at a loss for words at how outstanding my meal was.  A must-visit for ALL tourists!Staff&service 4 / 5  food 4 / 5 decor 4 / 5 I get why there's a big hype for tourists. . the decor is cool, the menus are funky looking and the combinations of food are odd but tasty.  However the lineups are long and the time to get the menus is long too.  If you're visiting montreal I recommend it but if you are from the area don't bother, go somewhere else. In Montreal for the week with family.  We decided to get some breakfast and looked this place up.  I ordered the Classic Eggs Benedict which was amazing.  The service was also great since we didn't really speak French that well and they were extremely helpful!Always. . . totally worth it! Dress warm from October on cuz its at least 20 minutes wait outside!I was confused as to how so many Montreal restaurants get near perfect ratings but I think I understand why.  They really do deliver! not just because the people there are so nice!Although we did wait in the cold on a Saturday morning for around 1. 5 hours, I can assure you that the food is worth the wait.  The eggs bennies are poaches to perfection and the hollandaise sauce is so smooth and creamy.  It's pure heaven on a plate.  The potatoes are seasoned nicely and everything just goes together really well.  It was the best brunch I have eaten.  There are ones in New York that are comparable but I would say that the flavours are not as "full of life", if that makes sense.  It's fresh but still extremely satisfying.  I think I'm going here each time I go to Montreal!Wait? What wait? So let me start by saying: expect to wait.  For like, an hour and a half.  Outside.  In the elements.  Now let me continue by saying, once you do make it inside, and that food touches your lips. . .  I swear it's sprinkled with mermaid kisses and instant amnesia dust.  That wait because ancient history.  I went with a group of about 8 for a friend of mines birthday (that was actually the entire reason I was in Montreal to begin with) and we found this place on Yelp! We already knew about the long line so we decided to take it in shifts.  A few people would wait while the rest would wonder and explore.  So we make it inside after waiting for a little over an hour, and wait a pleasant surprise.  The decor is super fun, colorful, and full of American satire.  The menu, like most things in Montreal is in French but the waitress, Elise I believe her name was, she was a doll! She explained and translated everything.  Everyone on my party ordered different variations of the egg Benedict.  I have never tasted something so delicious and flavorful yep beautiful for breakfast/brunch ever.  We went on to enjoy or food and two bottles of champagne we ordered for mimosas.  I'm going to assume Elise overheard our convo about the birthday celebration because at the end of the meal she brought out a complimentary round of shots! What a sweetie! This place was amazing! The food was ridiculously delicious, the service was impeccable, and the setting was trendy yet cozy.  If I lived in the area or visit Montreal again I will absolutely going back.  ps.  The bathrooms are crazy trippy!The.  Best.  Breakfast.   I used Yelp to locate the best place for a birthday brunch and L'Avenue was the number one hit.   Every review recommends an EARLY arrival on the weekends, and I can confirm that arriving before 10am on a Saturday is the best route for fast seating (ask to be in the back away from the door/draft!).   Quirky hipster ambiance (with suspended bicycles and massive maple syrup canisters) will make you feel like you're one of the cool kids.   Professional nom-worthy menu (with benedicts and waffles and omelets) will make you feel like one of the fat kids (in a good way). Order up an adult milkshake (with boooooooooooze) then tuck in and get ready to let your pants out.   The homefries: perfectly seasoned.   The waffle with nutella: what dreams are made of.   The omelet: large enough to feed a small family.   It's a large menu with something for everyone and prices that won't break the bank. Whatever you do. . . . . . go to the bathroom.   The coolest pee experience you'll ever have (unless you've used those one-way-mirror public potties. . . . in which case this will be the SECOND best pee experience!).   No more hints. . . . . just enjoy. . . . Usually when you see incredible long line outside a restaurant you tell yourself "ok this is the new hype" but this is place is the exception.  People are standing outside in line even in winter and its not for nothing. The food is outstanding, huge portions (I always split with my wife and we both are full at the end) and the quality is outstanding.  I gave it a 4 star and not 5 only because the long lines take some out of the experience.  Try the amazing natural shakes, out of this world egg benedicts and outstanding pancakes.  This is the place for brunch in Montreal. Came here for brunch while visiting Montréal after looking on Yelp.  This place had one of the highest reviews.  We got in line just in time before it got too crazy (before 10am).  The menu was in french only, so I brushed up on some of my high school french to make out what was on the menu.  The decor in the restaurant was unique.  They gave us a fruit "appetizer" which resembled a fruit kabob.  It was good.  We got one of their mixed fruity drinks/smoothie, which tasted good but nothing memorable.  I liked that their water was watermelon infused, it tasted refreshing.  *Disclaimer* I think I'm a little spoiled since there are many fantastic brunch places in Philly.  I had a very tasty french toast topped with fresh fruit! One of us got the cappuccino which was rich and came with a small piece of chocolate.  We ordered  several savory brunch dishes which was good but again nothing too memorable.  The service was just okay.  I think one of the most memorable things was strangely their blue lit creepy bathroom.  We saw several people go in at once to take pictures.  It was unique. . .  but again slightly creepy.  Despite not being too impressed, I had a decent experience.  I will probably not come back again since I don't regularly visit Montréal.  If I come back, I will probably explore some other brunch places in the area. Fantastic restaurant!!! My friend and I visited there around 9:30 am.  There was a line up outside, but luckily we only waited for 15 mins to have a seat.  The menu's design was interesting and the waitress provided us an English one.  We asked if we can order only one smoked salmon Benedict eggs to share.  The staff was really nice and told us they can help to separate the food into two parts and both of us can have fruit and fries by adding only 2$.  We certainly say YES.  When the food coming into our table, we felt so   satisfied because it looked so gooood!!The hollandaise sauce was very creamy, the egg was boiled perfectly, fruits were sweet and fresh, fries were not greasy.  Everything was delicious. Oh! BTW, even their washroom is awesome too.  Fluorescent painting on the wall~ Best breakfast made our Montreal to a perfection!Best breakfast food ever. Omelets , panacakes, there were 4 of us and we couldnt even get up to leave. Oh.  My.  God.  Yum.  I went here on a Thursday for brunch with a friend and the reviews were right, this place is amazing.  The waiter explained how they really put an emphasis on ensuring the best quality food, and this showed when we got our food.  I arrived before my friend and was worried I would have to wait for her before I could get seated (there was only one couple in front of me when I arrived) but I asked the waiter and he said I didn't have to wait and seated me right by the window.  He was very friendly and helpful.  I had the French toast with bananas caramelized in captain Morgan rum, with Nutella and a sauce (which a believe had rum also) with real pieces of coconut on top.  The flavors went so well together and weren't overly sweet tasting.  The portion size was big, I wasn't able to finish my plate.  I was surprised this place was even able to accommodate my friend who has so many restrictions (doesn't eat gluten, vegetarian, and lactose intolerant).  She ordered the eggs Benedict with all vegetables, substituted the English muffins for portobello mushrooms ($2 charge) and swapped out her potatoes for a salad ($1 charge).  I had read someone's review saying the bathrooms will give you nightmares, so of course I had to check them out, and they're awesome.  There was a lot of water on the floor though :/ I will definitely be back here.  I'd suggest going on a weekday before 11am to avoid a huge lineup. Canadian brunchBagels can be got laterNow benedict timeI did my very best in Montreal to make sure every meal was a 5 star meal, and this brunch was no exception.  Show up early for a seat, the line goes out the door.  We were right on time to be seated as a party of 8, and we were treated awesomely.  The duck benedict, salmon benedict, gluten-free pancake, omelettes, coffee, smoothies, all incredible.  If you're looking for a great local brunch spot, this place is worth the distance traveled.  Also, the bathroom is absolutely terrifying. Je suis triste -  I wish L'Avenue was in Toronto.   We came here at around 10:30am, arriving to a lineup of roughly 8-10 people ahead of us, which moved relatively quickly (maybe a 15 minute wait, at max?).   Appreciated that despite the short wait, there's a cooler with ice water available at the front of the line for any overheated guests waiting for a table.  Which takes me to the next point: seemingly superfluous details are far from lost.   Himalayan pink salt sits in the table salt shakers instead of regular ol' stinky salt.   Water inside comes from a huge, clear plastic cube dispenser, with whole rounds of watermelon floating inside to flavour the water.   Cafe latte glacee, which I thought would simply be caffe latte poured over ice, actually came in a large glass and blended, like an iced capp but much less sweet.  A free skewer of fresh fruit will serve as your appetizer, regardless of whatever dish you might've ordered.  My pick for the day was the eggs Benedict "Tout L'Monde a Poele": Two huge mounds of sautéed mushrooms, bacon on English muffins topped with two poached eggs.  Sadly, a couple of our eggs were overcooked.  The hubs had the eggs Benedict with the truffle. . . before I ate the tiny bit of black truffle shavings on top, because I'm a monster like that.   The hollandaise, while I have to admit wasn't the best I've had, was also not the worst - it actually tasted of butter.  Both bennys were delicious.  My tips:- Menus are in French, I'm not sure whether or not they have English menus available.   If this puts you off, I suggest reading their menu online so you can Google in advance.  - If French is not your forte, when greeted by waitstaff, make sure you reply in English.   If you answer in French, be prepared to speak French the rest of the time you're there.  - Come early-ish! Pretty much anything past 11 and you're in line for the long haul.  Portions are large, so warm up your belly before you come here.   Bon appetit!Ahhhhhhmazing!! Is all I can say.  Best salmon egg benedict I've ever had.  They give you fruit to start with, which was very lovely and delicious! Great way to start the day.  My friend and I were visiting Montréal from Massachusetts and we stumbled upon this place on Yelp.  Saw the reviews and needed to go! Be aware that you will most likely wait in a line, but if you're with one or two people you can get in sooner.  The menu is in all French (had to google translate some stuff) but the waitress helped us find what we wanted.  My friend got the Idaho omelette and she said it was the most intricate omelette she ever had haha so many flavors and ingredients!! I got the salmon benedict and almost died.  Literally.  It was so good!! The hash browns are home made, too and they put some seasoning in it that will make you want more.  This place is the spot for breakfast/brunch!!This was the last establishment that my friends and I had hit up prior to our long drive back to NYC.  We had thought about eating here earlier, but was scared off by the super long queues the day prior.  We figured there wouldn't be as long of a wait on a Monday morning, and we were right.  We were seated almost immediately upon reaching the restaurant. Aside from the eclectic decor, the menu offers plenty of different options to suit most palates.  I got their truffled mushroom omelette, which I thought erred a little on the bland side, though the mushrooms themselves were delicious.  The potatoes that came with my dish were also good, but at this point in my trip, I kind of never wanted to see another potato again.  Portions were gargantuan so I definitely felt like I got my money's worth, but I thought the food would've been jaw-droppingly awesome considering how long the queues had been just the day before, and presumably every weekend.  I'm not sure I would've waited for more than half an hour for the meal I had been served, to be quite honest, so I was especially glad that I didn't have to wait when we actually ate here. Service was excellent, though, and the bathrooms were also quite interesting.  Oh, and every entree comes with fruit skewers and watermelon flavored water.  3. 5 stars, really. Amazing benedict on French toast! Staff are attentive and friendly.  Smoothies are at good value!Loved the decor in this restaurant- it was retro with graffiti/art all over the walls and a motorcycle hanging above our heads.  We waited over an hour (as expected) to get a table here.  Luckily the weather was beautiful, and they had free fresh lemonade for anyone in line.  The space was a little cramped, and once we were seated, we still had to wait for menus since they didn't have enough. I had very high expectations for the food because everyone raved about it being the best brunch spot in Montreal.  My bf and I shared a smoothie, which was okay, but it had too much raspberry flavor, and I didn't taste whatever else the waitress described it having (supposedly strawberry, basil, etc).  What was nice though is that they give you a free plate of fruit on a skewer.  I got the steak and eggs benedict with potatoes.  The potatoes were probably the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had- they were cooked perfectly and had a hint of salty and sweet flavor to them.  For my steak and eggs (and mushrooms) benedict, it was delicious.  However, my poached eggs were overcooked and they didn't ooze out like they were supposed to.  This was a little disappointing, but overall I still enjoyed my meal here. Decor is fun, hip and trendy.  The restaurant has a laid back vibe and from what I saw, seems to always draw a large crowd.  My boyfriend got the steak and eggs and I got the veggie omelette.  Both dishes were good, nothing outstanding but the restaurant is worth checking out for travelers.  And be sure to take a look at the bathroom!With the waiting time outside, the cold, and the long ass line of people, my patience and my expectations was really really high.  After 45min of waiting, finally a seat.  But HOLY MOTHER OF GOD.  Probably the best brunch I had.  Quality is high as hell, flavour are perfectly mix, top presentation, nice ambiance, i wish I had something bad to say but can't find any.  45min? 30 min of wait? Go for it.  You won't regret it. BEST EGGS BENEDICT EVER. The line outside the door at around 10:30 am was pretty long; I'd say we waited maybe 20-30 minutes? The longer I waited, the higher my standards were for this place, to be honest! The ambiance is pretty interesting--a floating motorcycle above one table, a colorful mannequin at the window, and the whole place seemed to rely mostly on sunlight from the windows.  My boyfriend has been here before and he recommended that I get the steak and mushroom benedict.  I did, and we also got complimentary assorted fruits on a skewer.

After 45min of waiting, finally a seat.  But HOLY MOTHER OF GOD.  Probably the best brunch I had.  Quality is high as hell, flavour are perfectly mix, top presentation, nice ambiance, i wish I had something bad to say but can't find any.  45min? 30 min of wait? Go for it.  You won't regret it. BEST EGGS BENEDICT EVER. The line outside the door at around 10:30 am was pretty long; I'd say we waited maybe 20-30 minutes? The longer I waited, the higher my standards were for this place, to be honest! The ambiance is pretty interesting--a floating motorcycle above one table, a colorful mannequin at the window, and the whole place seemed to rely mostly on sunlight from the windows.  My boyfriend has been here before and he recommended that I get the steak and mushroom benedict.  I did, and we also got complimentary assorted fruits on a skewer.  The water tasted strange, and we assumed it was maybe infused with fruit before hand or something, but it wasn't bad.  When my eggs benedict came out, it smelled AMAZING.  At both ends of the plate were sliced English muffins, with the eggs benedict on top and the tender steak and mushrooms topped everything else (it also had its own type of gravy, which mixed in with the hollandaise sauce).  In the middle of the plate was a small cup of roasted potatoes.  First bite I took, I tried tasting the egg, muffin, a piece of steak and a piece of mushroom simultaneously and I couldn't keep up a conversation with our friends--THE FOOD WAS JUST TOO GOOD and I wanted to endure every chew.  The hollandaise sauce was so unique to me because it didn't taste so bland, and having it be mixed with the tangy gravy sauce that accompanied the steak made the whole forkful even better.  The wait was worth it.  The service is great.  The food is better.  I am at a loss for words at how outstanding my meal was.  A must-visit for ALL tourists!Staff&service 4 / 5  food 4 / 5 decor 4 / 5 I get why there's a big hype for tourists. . the decor is cool, the menus are funky looking and the combinations of food are odd but tasty.  However the lineups are long and the time to get the menus is long too.  If you're visiting montreal I recommend it but if you are from the area don't bother, go somewhere else. In Montreal for the week with family.  We decided to get some breakfast and looked this place up.  I ordered the Classic Eggs Benedict which was amazing.  The service was also great since we didn't really speak French that well and they were extremely helpful!Always. . . totally worth it! Dress warm from October on cuz its at least 20 minutes wait outside!I was confused as to how so many Montreal restaurants get near perfect ratings but I think I understand why.  They really do deliver! not just because the people there are so nice!Although we did wait in the cold on a Saturday morning for around 1. 5 hours, I can assure you that the food is worth the wait.  The eggs bennies are poaches to perfection and the hollandaise sauce is so smooth and creamy.  It's pure heaven on a plate.  The potatoes are seasoned nicely and everything just goes together really well.  It was the best brunch I have eaten.  There are ones in New York that are comparable but I would say that the flavours are not as "full of life", if that makes sense.  It's fresh but still extremely satisfying.  I think I'm going here each time I go to Montreal!Wait? What wait? So let me start by saying: expect to wait.  For like, an hour and a half.  Outside.  In the elements.  Now let me continue by saying, once you do make it inside, and that food touches your lips. . .  I swear it's sprinkled with mermaid kisses and instant amnesia dust.  That wait because ancient history.  I went with a group of about 8 for a friend of mines birthday (that was actually the entire reason I was in Montreal to begin with) and we found this place on Yelp! We already knew about the long line so we decided to take it in shifts.  A few people would wait while the rest would wonder and explore.  So we make it inside after waiting for a little over an hour, and wait a pleasant surprise.  The decor is super fun, colorful, and full of American satire.  The menu, like most things in Montreal is in French but the waitress, Elise I believe her name was, she was a doll! She explained and translated everything.  Everyone on my party ordered different variations of the egg Benedict.  I have never tasted something so delicious and flavorful yep beautiful for breakfast/brunch ever.  We went on to enjoy or food and two bottles of champagne we ordered for mimosas.  I'm going to assume Elise overheard our convo about the birthday celebration because at the end of the meal she brought out a complimentary round of shots! What a sweetie! This place was amazing! The food was ridiculously delicious, the service was impeccable, and the setting was trendy yet cozy.  If I lived in the area or visit Montreal again I will absolutely going back.  ps.  The bathrooms are crazy trippy!The.  Best.  Breakfast.   I used Yelp to locate the best place for a birthday brunch and L'Avenue was the number one hit.   Every review recommends an EARLY arrival on the weekends, and I can confirm that arriving before 10am on a Saturday is the best route for fast seating (ask to be in the back away from the door/draft!).   Quirky hipster ambiance (with suspended bicycles and massive maple syrup canisters) will make you feel like you're one of the cool kids.   Professional nom-worthy menu (with benedicts and waffles and omelets) will make you feel like one of the fat kids (in a good way). Order up an adult milkshake (with boooooooooooze) then tuck in and get ready to let your pants out.   The homefries: perfectly seasoned.   The waffle with nutella: what dreams are made of.   The omelet: large enough to feed a small family.   It's a large menu with something for everyone and prices that won't break the bank. Whatever you do. . . . . . go to the bathroom.   The coolest pee experience you'll ever have (unless you've used those one-way-mirror public potties. . . . in which case this will be the SECOND best pee experience!).   No more hints. . . . . just enjoy. . . . Usually when you see incredible long line outside a restaurant you tell yourself "ok this is the new hype" but this is place is the exception.  People are standing outside in line even in winter and its not for nothing. The food is outstanding, huge portions (I always split with my wife and we both are full at the end) and the quality is outstanding.  I gave it a 4 star and not 5 only because the long lines take some out of the experience.  Try the amazing natural shakes, out of this world egg benedicts and outstanding pancakes.  This is the place for brunch in Montreal. Came here for brunch while visiting Montréal after looking on Yelp.  This place had one of the highest reviews.  We got in line just in time before it got too crazy (before 10am).  The menu was in french only, so I brushed up on some of my high school french to make out what was on the menu.  The decor in the restaurant was unique.  They gave us a fruit "appetizer" which resembled a fruit kabob.  It was good.  We got one of their mixed fruity drinks/smoothie, which tasted good but nothing memorable.  I liked that their water was watermelon infused, it tasted refreshing.  *Disclaimer* I think I'm a little spoiled since there are many fantastic brunch places in Philly.  I had a very tasty french toast topped with fresh fruit! One of us got the cappuccino which was rich and came with a small piece of chocolate.  We ordered  several savory brunch dishes which was good but again nothing too memorable.  The service was just okay.  I think one of the most memorable things was strangely their blue lit creepy bathroom.  We saw several people go in at once to take pictures.  It was unique. . .  but again slightly creepy.  Despite not being too impressed, I had a decent experience.  I will probably not come back again since I don't regularly visit Montréal.  If I come back, I will probably explore some other brunch places in the area. Fantastic restaurant!!! My friend and I visited there around 9:30 am.  There was a line up outside, but luckily we only waited for 15 mins to have a seat.  The menu's design was interesting and the waitress provided us an English one.  We asked if we can order only one smoked salmon Benedict eggs to share.  The staff was really nice and told us they can help to separate the food into two parts and both of us can have fruit and fries by adding only 2$.  We certainly say YES.  When the food coming into our table, we felt so   satisfied because it looked so gooood!!The hollandaise sauce was very creamy, the egg was boiled perfectly, fruits were sweet and fresh, fries were not greasy.  Everything was delicious. Oh! BTW, even their washroom is awesome too.  Fluorescent painting on the wall~ Best breakfast made our Montreal to a perfection!Best breakfast food ever. Omelets , panacakes, there were 4 of us and we couldnt even get up to leave. Oh.  My.  God.  Yum.  I went here on a Thursday for brunch with a friend and the reviews were right, this place is amazing.  The waiter explained how they really put an emphasis on ensuring the best quality food, and this showed when we got our food.  I arrived before my friend and was worried I would have to wait for her before I could get seated (there was only one couple in front of me when I arrived) but I asked the waiter and he said I didn't have to wait and seated me right by the window.  He was very friendly and helpful.  I had the French toast with bananas caramelized in captain Morgan rum, with Nutella and a sauce (which a believe had rum also) with real pieces of coconut on top.  The flavors went so well together and weren't overly sweet tasting.  The portion size was big, I wasn't able to finish my plate.  I was surprised this place was even able to accommodate my friend who has so many restrictions (doesn't eat gluten, vegetarian, and lactose intolerant).  She ordered the eggs Benedict with all vegetables, substituted the English muffins for portobello mushrooms ($2 charge) and swapped out her potatoes for a salad ($1 charge).  I had read someone's review saying the bathrooms will give you nightmares, so of course I had to check them out, and they're awesome.  There was a lot of water on the floor though :/ I will definitely be back here.  I'd suggest going on a weekday before 11am to avoid a huge lineup. Canadian brunchBagels can be got laterNow benedict timeI did my very best in Montreal to make sure every meal was a 5 star meal, and this brunch was no exception.  Show up early for a seat, the line goes out the door.  We were right on time to be seated as a party of 8, and we were treated awesomely.  The duck benedict, salmon benedict, gluten-free pancake, omelettes, coffee, smoothies, all incredible.  If you're looking for a great local brunch spot, this place is worth the distance traveled.  Also, the bathroom is absolutely terrifying. Je suis triste -  I wish L'Avenue was in Toronto.   We came here at around 10:30am, arriving to a lineup of roughly 8-10 people ahead of us, which moved relatively quickly (maybe a 15 minute wait, at max?).   Appreciated that despite the short wait, there's a cooler with ice water available at the front of the line for any overheated guests waiting for a table.  Which takes me to the next point: seemingly superfluous details are far from lost.   Himalayan pink salt sits in the table salt shakers instead of regular ol' stinky salt.   Water inside comes from a huge, clear plastic cube dispenser, with whole rounds of watermelon floating inside to flavour the water.   Cafe latte glacee, which I thought would simply be caffe latte poured over ice, actually came in a large glass and blended, like an iced capp but much less sweet.  A free skewer of fresh fruit will serve as your appetizer, regardless of whatever dish you might've ordered.  My pick for the day was the eggs Benedict "Tout L'Monde a Poele": Two huge mounds of sautéed mushrooms, bacon on English muffins topped with two poached eggs.  Sadly, a couple of our eggs were overcooked.  The hubs had the eggs Benedict with the truffle. . . before I ate the tiny bit of black truffle shavings on top, because I'm a monster like that.   The hollandaise, while I have to admit wasn't the best I've had, was also not the worst - it actually tasted of butter.  Both bennys were delicious.  My tips:- Menus are in French, I'm not sure whether or not they have English menus available.   If this puts you off, I suggest reading their menu online so you can Google in advance.  - If French is not your forte, when greeted by waitstaff, make sure you reply in English.   If you answer in French, be prepared to speak French the rest of the time you're there.  - Come early-ish! Pretty much anything past 11 and you're in line for the long haul.  Portions are large, so warm up your belly before you come here.   Bon appetit!Ahhhhhhmazing!! Is all I can say.  Best salmon egg benedict I've ever had.  They give you fruit to start with, which was very lovely and delicious! Great way to start the day.  My friend and I were visiting Montréal from Massachusetts and we stumbled upon this place on Yelp.  Saw the reviews and needed to go! Be aware that you will most likely wait in a line, but if you're with one or two people you can get in sooner.  The menu is in all French (had to google translate some stuff) but the waitress helped us find what we wanted.  My friend got the Idaho omelette and she said it was the most intricate omelette she ever had haha so many flavors and ingredients!! I got the salmon benedict and almost died.  Literally.  It was so good!! The hash browns are home made, too and they put some seasoning in it that will make you want more.  This place is the spot for breakfast/brunch!!This was the last establishment that my friends and I had hit up prior to our long drive back to NYC.  We had thought about eating here earlier, but was scared off by the super long queues the day prior.  We figured there wouldn't be as long of a wait on a Monday morning, and we were right.  We were seated almost immediately upon reaching the restaurant. Aside from the eclectic decor, the menu offers plenty of different options to suit most palates.  I got their truffled mushroom omelette, which I thought erred a little on the bland side, though the mushrooms themselves were delicious.  The potatoes that came with my dish were also good, but at this point in my trip, I kind of never wanted to see another potato again.  Portions were gargantuan so I definitely felt like I got my money's worth, but I thought the food would've been jaw-droppingly awesome considering how long the queues had been just the day before, and presumably every weekend.  I'm not sure I would've waited for more than half an hour for the meal I had been served, to be quite honest, so I was especially glad that I didn't have to wait when we actually ate here. Service was excellent, though, and the bathrooms were also quite interesting.  Oh, and every entree comes with fruit skewers and watermelon flavored water.  3. 5 stars, really. Amazing benedict on French toast! Staff are attentive and friendly.  Smoothies are at good value!Loved the decor in this restaurant- it was retro with graffiti/art all over the walls and a motorcycle hanging above our heads.  We waited over an hour (as expected) to get a table here.  Luckily the weather was beautiful, and they had free fresh lemonade for anyone in line.  The space was a little cramped, and once we were seated, we still had to wait for menus since they didn't have enough. I had very high expectations for the food because everyone raved about it being the best brunch spot in Montreal.  My bf and I shared a smoothie, which was okay, but it had too much raspberry flavor, and I didn't taste whatever else the waitress described it having (supposedly strawberry, basil, etc).  What was nice though is that they give you a free plate of fruit on a skewer.  I got the steak and eggs benedict with potatoes.  The potatoes were probably the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had- they were cooked perfectly and had a hint of salty and sweet flavor to them.  For my steak and eggs (and mushrooms) benedict, it was delicious.  However, my poached eggs were overcooked and they didn't ooze out like they were supposed to.  This was a little disappointing, but overall I still enjoyed my meal here. Decor is fun, hip and trendy.  The restaurant has a laid back vibe and from what I saw, seems to always draw a large crowd.  My boyfriend got the steak and eggs and I got the veggie omelette.  Both dishes were good, nothing outstanding but the restaurant is worth checking out for travelers.  And be sure to take a look at the bathroom!With the waiting time outside, the cold, and the long ass line of people, my patience and my expectations was really really high.

What was nice though is that they give you a free plate of fruit on a skewer.  I got the steak and eggs benedict with potatoes.  The potatoes were probably the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had- they were cooked perfectly and had a hint of salty and sweet flavor to them.  For my steak and eggs (and mushrooms) benedict, it was delicious.  However, my poached eggs were overcooked and they didn't ooze out like they were supposed to.  This was a little disappointing, but overall I still enjoyed my meal here. Decor is fun, hip and trendy.  The restaurant has a laid back vibe and from what I saw, seems to always draw a large crowd.  My boyfriend got the steak and eggs and I got the veggie omelette.  Both dishes were good, nothing outstanding but the restaurant is worth checking out for travelers.  And be sure to take a look at the bathroom!With the waiting time outside, the cold, and the long ass line of people, my patience and my expectations was really really high.  After 45min of waiting, finally a seat.  But HOLY MOTHER OF GOD.  Probably the best brunch I had.  Quality is high as hell, flavour are perfectly mix, top presentation, nice ambiance, i wish I had something bad to say but can't find any.  45min? 30 min of wait? Go for it.  You won't regret it. BEST EGGS BENEDICT EVER. The line outside the door at around 10:30 am was pretty long; I'd say we waited maybe 20-30 minutes? The longer I waited, the higher my standards were for this place, to be honest! The ambiance is pretty interesting--a floating motorcycle above one table, a colorful mannequin at the window, and the whole place seemed to rely mostly on sunlight from the windows.  My boyfriend has been here before and he recommended that I get the steak and mushroom benedict.  I did, and we also got complimentary assorted fruits on a skewer.  The water tasted strange, and we assumed it was maybe infused with fruit before hand or something, but it wasn't bad.  When my eggs benedict came out, it smelled AMAZING.  At both ends of the plate were sliced English muffins, with the eggs benedict on top and the tender steak and mushrooms topped everything else (it also had its own type of gravy, which mixed in with the hollandaise sauce).  In the middle of the plate was a small cup of roasted potatoes.  First bite I took, I tried tasting the egg, muffin, a piece of steak and a piece of mushroom simultaneously and I couldn't keep up a conversation with our friends--THE FOOD WAS JUST TOO GOOD and I wanted to endure every chew.  The hollandaise sauce was so unique to me because it didn't taste so bland, and having it be mixed with the tangy gravy sauce that accompanied the steak made the whole forkful even better.  The wait was worth it.  The service is great.  The food is better.  I am at a loss for words at how outstanding my meal was.  A must-visit for ALL tourists!Staff&service 4 / 5  food 4 / 5 decor 4 / 5 I get why there's a big hype for tourists. . the decor is cool, the menus are funky looking and the combinations of food are odd but tasty.  However the lineups are long and the time to get the menus is long too.  If you're visiting montreal I recommend it but if you are from the area don't bother, go somewhere else. In Montreal for the week with family.  We decided to get some breakfast and looked this place up.  I ordered the Classic Eggs Benedict which was amazing.  The service was also great since we didn't really speak French that well and they were extremely helpful!Always. . . totally worth it! Dress warm from October on cuz its at least 20 minutes wait outside!I was confused as to how so many Montreal restaurants get near perfect ratings but I think I understand why.  They really do deliver! not just because the people there are so nice!Although we did wait in the cold on a Saturday morning for around 1. 5 hours, I can assure you that the food is worth the wait.  The eggs bennies are poaches to perfection and the hollandaise sauce is so smooth and creamy.  It's pure heaven on a plate.  The potatoes are seasoned nicely and everything just goes together really well.  It was the best brunch I have eaten.  There are ones in New York that are comparable but I would say that the flavours are not as "full of life", if that makes sense.  It's fresh but still extremely satisfying.  I think I'm going here each time I go to Montreal!Wait? What wait? So let me start by saying: expect to wait.  For like, an hour and a half.  Outside.  In the elements.  Now let me continue by saying, once you do make it inside, and that food touches your lips. . .  I swear it's sprinkled with mermaid kisses and instant amnesia dust.  That wait because ancient history.  I went with a group of about 8 for a friend of mines birthday (that was actually the entire reason I was in Montreal to begin with) and we found this place on Yelp! We already knew about the long line so we decided to take it in shifts.  A few people would wait while the rest would wonder and explore.  So we make it inside after waiting for a little over an hour, and wait a pleasant surprise.  The decor is super fun, colorful, and full of American satire.  The menu, like most things in Montreal is in French but the waitress, Elise I believe her name was, she was a doll! She explained and translated everything.  Everyone on my party ordered different variations of the egg Benedict.  I have never tasted something so delicious and flavorful yep beautiful for breakfast/brunch ever.  We went on to enjoy or food and two bottles of champagne we ordered for mimosas.  I'm going to assume Elise overheard our convo about the birthday celebration because at the end of the meal she brought out a complimentary round of shots! What a sweetie! This place was amazing! The food was ridiculously delicious, the service was impeccable, and the setting was trendy yet cozy.  If I lived in the area or visit Montreal again I will absolutely going back.  ps.  The bathrooms are crazy trippy!The.  Best.  Breakfast.   I used Yelp to locate the best place for a birthday brunch and L'Avenue was the number one hit.   Every review recommends an EARLY arrival on the weekends, and I can confirm that arriving before 10am on a Saturday is the best route for fast seating (ask to be in the back away from the door/draft!).   Quirky hipster ambiance (with suspended bicycles and massive maple syrup canisters) will make you feel like you're one of the cool kids.   Professional nom-worthy menu (with benedicts and waffles and omelets) will make you feel like one of the fat kids (in a good way). Order up an adult milkshake (with boooooooooooze) then tuck in and get ready to let your pants out.   The homefries: perfectly seasoned.   The waffle with nutella: what dreams are made of.   The omelet: large enough to feed a small family.   It's a large menu with something for everyone and prices that won't break the bank. Whatever you do. . . . . . go to the bathroom.   The coolest pee experience you'll ever have (unless you've used those one-way-mirror public potties. . . . in which case this will be the SECOND best pee experience!).   No more hints. . . . . just enjoy. . . . Usually when you see incredible long line outside a restaurant you tell yourself "ok this is the new hype" but this is place is the exception.  People are standing outside in line even in winter and its not for nothing. The food is outstanding, huge portions (I always split with my wife and we both are full at the end) and the quality is outstanding.  I gave it a 4 star and not 5 only because the long lines take some out of the experience.  Try the amazing natural shakes, out of this world egg benedicts and outstanding pancakes.  This is the place for brunch in Montreal. Came here for brunch while visiting Montréal after looking on Yelp.  This place had one of the highest reviews.  We got in line just in time before it got too crazy (before 10am).  The menu was in french only, so I brushed up on some of my high school french to make out what was on the menu.  The decor in the restaurant was unique.  They gave us a fruit "appetizer" which resembled a fruit kabob.  It was good.  We got one of their mixed fruity drinks/smoothie, which tasted good but nothing memorable.  I liked that their water was watermelon infused, it tasted refreshing.  *Disclaimer* I think I'm a little spoiled since there are many fantastic brunch places in Philly.  I had a very tasty french toast topped with fresh fruit! One of us got the cappuccino which was rich and came with a small piece of chocolate.  We ordered  several savory brunch dishes which was good but again nothing too memorable.  The service was just okay.  I think one of the most memorable things was strangely their blue lit creepy bathroom.  We saw several people go in at once to take pictures.  It was unique. . .  but again slightly creepy.  Despite not being too impressed, I had a decent experience.  I will probably not come back again since I don't regularly visit Montréal.  If I come back, I will probably explore some other brunch places in the area. Fantastic restaurant!!! My friend and I visited there around 9:30 am.  There was a line up outside, but luckily we only waited for 15 mins to have a seat.  The menu's design was interesting and the waitress provided us an English one.  We asked if we can order only one smoked salmon Benedict eggs to share.  The staff was really nice and told us they can help to separate the food into two parts and both of us can have fruit and fries by adding only 2$.  We certainly say YES.  When the food coming into our table, we felt so   satisfied because it looked so gooood!!The hollandaise sauce was very creamy, the egg was boiled perfectly, fruits were sweet and fresh, fries were not greasy.  Everything was delicious. Oh! BTW, even their washroom is awesome too.  Fluorescent painting on the wall~ Best breakfast made our Montreal to a perfection!Best breakfast food ever. Omelets , panacakes, there were 4 of us and we couldnt even get up to leave. Oh.  My.  God.  Yum.  I went here on a Thursday for brunch with a friend and the reviews were right, this place is amazing.  The waiter explained how they really put an emphasis on ensuring the best quality food, and this showed when we got our food.  I arrived before my friend and was worried I would have to wait for her before I could get seated (there was only one couple in front of me when I arrived) but I asked the waiter and he said I didn't have to wait and seated me right by the window.  He was very friendly and helpful.  I had the French toast with bananas caramelized in captain Morgan rum, with Nutella and a sauce (which a believe had rum also) with real pieces of coconut on top.  The flavors went so well together and weren't overly sweet tasting.  The portion size was big, I wasn't able to finish my plate.  I was surprised this place was even able to accommodate my friend who has so many restrictions (doesn't eat gluten, vegetarian, and lactose intolerant).  She ordered the eggs Benedict with all vegetables, substituted the English muffins for portobello mushrooms ($2 charge) and swapped out her potatoes for a salad ($1 charge).  I had read someone's review saying the bathrooms will give you nightmares, so of course I had to check them out, and they're awesome.  There was a lot of water on the floor though :/ I will definitely be back here.  I'd suggest going on a weekday before 11am to avoid a huge lineup. Canadian brunchBagels can be got laterNow benedict timeI did my very best in Montreal to make sure every meal was a 5 star meal, and this brunch was no exception.  Show up early for a seat, the line goes out the door.  We were right on time to be seated as a party of 8, and we were treated awesomely.  The duck benedict, salmon benedict, gluten-free pancake, omelettes, coffee, smoothies, all incredible.  If you're looking for a great local brunch spot, this place is worth the distance traveled.  Also, the bathroom is absolutely terrifying. Je suis triste -  I wish L'Avenue was in Toronto.   We came here at around 10:30am, arriving to a lineup of roughly 8-10 people ahead of us, which moved relatively quickly (maybe a 15 minute wait, at max?).   Appreciated that despite the short wait, there's a cooler with ice water available at the front of the line for any overheated guests waiting for a table.  Which takes me to the next point: seemingly superfluous details are far from lost.   Himalayan pink salt sits in the table salt shakers instead of regular ol' stinky salt.   Water inside comes from a huge, clear plastic cube dispenser, with whole rounds of watermelon floating inside to flavour the water.   Cafe latte glacee, which I thought would simply be caffe latte poured over ice, actually came in a large glass and blended, like an iced capp but much less sweet.  A free skewer of fresh fruit will serve as your appetizer, regardless of whatever dish you might've ordered.  My pick for the day was the eggs Benedict "Tout L'Monde a Poele": Two huge mounds of sautéed mushrooms, bacon on English muffins topped with two poached eggs.  Sadly, a couple of our eggs were overcooked.  The hubs had the eggs Benedict with the truffle. . . before I ate the tiny bit of black truffle shavings on top, because I'm a monster like that.   The hollandaise, while I have to admit wasn't the best I've had, was also not the worst - it actually tasted of butter.  Both bennys were delicious.  My tips:- Menus are in French, I'm not sure whether or not they have English menus available.   If this puts you off, I suggest reading their menu online so you can Google in advance.  - If French is not your forte, when greeted by waitstaff, make sure you reply in English.   If you answer in French, be prepared to speak French the rest of the time you're there.  - Come early-ish! Pretty much anything past 11 and you're in line for the long haul.  Portions are large, so warm up your belly before you come here.   Bon appetit!Ahhhhhhmazing!! Is all I can say.  Best salmon egg benedict I've ever had.  They give you fruit to start with, which was very lovely and delicious! Great way to start the day.  My friend and I were visiting Montréal from Massachusetts and we stumbled upon this place on Yelp.  Saw the reviews and needed to go! Be aware that you will most likely wait in a line, but if you're with one or two people you can get in sooner.  The menu is in all French (had to google translate some stuff) but the waitress helped us find what we wanted.  My friend got the Idaho omelette and she said it was the most intricate omelette she ever had haha so many flavors and ingredients!! I got the salmon benedict and almost died.  Literally.  It was so good!! The hash browns are home made, too and they put some seasoning in it that will make you want more.  This place is the spot for breakfast/brunch!!This was the last establishment that my friends and I had hit up prior to our long drive back to NYC.  We had thought about eating here earlier, but was scared off by the super long queues the day prior.  We figured there wouldn't be as long of a wait on a Monday morning, and we were right.  We were seated almost immediately upon reaching the restaurant. Aside from the eclectic decor, the menu offers plenty of different options to suit most palates.  I got their truffled mushroom omelette, which I thought erred a little on the bland side, though the mushrooms themselves were delicious.  The potatoes that came with my dish were also good, but at this point in my trip, I kind of never wanted to see another potato again.  Portions were gargantuan so I definitely felt like I got my money's worth, but I thought the food would've been jaw-droppingly awesome considering how long the queues had been just the day before, and presumably every weekend.  I'm not sure I would've waited for more than half an hour for the meal I had been served, to be quite honest, so I was especially glad that I didn't have to wait when we actually ate here. Service was excellent, though, and the bathrooms were also quite interesting.  Oh, and every entree comes with fruit skewers and watermelon flavored water.  3. 5 stars, really. Amazing benedict on French toast! Staff are attentive and friendly.  Smoothies are at good value!Loved the decor in this restaurant- it was retro with graffiti/art all over the walls and a motorcycle hanging above our heads.  We waited over an hour (as expected) to get a table here.  Luckily the weather was beautiful, and they had free fresh lemonade for anyone in line.  The space was a little cramped, and once we were seated, we still had to wait for menus since they didn't have enough. I had very high expectations for the food because everyone raved about it being the best brunch spot in Montreal.  My bf and I shared a smoothie, which was okay, but it had too much raspberry flavor, and I didn't taste whatever else the waitress described it having (supposedly strawberry, basil, etc).

Service was excellent, though, and the bathrooms were also quite interesting.  Oh, and every entree comes with fruit skewers and watermelon flavored water.  3. 5 stars, really. Amazing benedict on French toast! Staff are attentive and friendly.  Smoothies are at good value!Loved the decor in this restaurant- it was retro with graffiti/art all over the walls and a motorcycle hanging above our heads.  We waited over an hour (as expected) to get a table here.  Luckily the weather was beautiful, and they had free fresh lemonade for anyone in line.  The space was a little cramped, and once we were seated, we still had to wait for menus since they didn't have enough. I had very high expectations for the food because everyone raved about it being the best brunch spot in Montreal.  My bf and I shared a smoothie, which was okay, but it had too much raspberry flavor, and I didn't taste whatever else the waitress described it having (supposedly strawberry, basil, etc).  What was nice though is that they give you a free plate of fruit on a skewer.  I got the steak and eggs benedict with potatoes.  The potatoes were probably the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had- they were cooked perfectly and had a hint of salty and sweet flavor to them.  For my steak and eggs (and mushrooms) benedict, it was delicious.  However, my poached eggs were overcooked and they didn't ooze out like they were supposed to.  This was a little disappointing, but overall I still enjoyed my meal here. Decor is fun, hip and trendy.  The restaurant has a laid back vibe and from what I saw, seems to always draw a large crowd.  My boyfriend got the steak and eggs and I got the veggie omelette.  Both dishes were good, nothing outstanding but the restaurant is worth checking out for travelers.  And be sure to take a look at the bathroom!With the waiting time outside, the cold, and the long ass line of people, my patience and my expectations was really really high.  After 45min of waiting, finally a seat.  But HOLY MOTHER OF GOD.  Probably the best brunch I had.  Quality is high as hell, flavour are perfectly mix, top presentation, nice ambiance, i wish I had something bad to say but can't find any.  45min? 30 min of wait? Go for it.  You won't regret it. BEST EGGS BENEDICT EVER. The line outside the door at around 10:30 am was pretty long; I'd say we waited maybe 20-30 minutes? The longer I waited, the higher my standards were for this place, to be honest! The ambiance is pretty interesting--a floating motorcycle above one table, a colorful mannequin at the window, and the whole place seemed to rely mostly on sunlight from the windows.  My boyfriend has been here before and he recommended that I get the steak and mushroom benedict.  I did, and we also got complimentary assorted fruits on a skewer.  The water tasted strange, and we assumed it was maybe infused with fruit before hand or something, but it wasn't bad.  When my eggs benedict came out, it smelled AMAZING.  At both ends of the plate were sliced English muffins, with the eggs benedict on top and the tender steak and mushrooms topped everything else (it also had its own type of gravy, which mixed in with the hollandaise sauce).  In the middle of the plate was a small cup of roasted potatoes.  First bite I took, I tried tasting the egg, muffin, a piece of steak and a piece of mushroom simultaneously and I couldn't keep up a conversation with our friends--THE FOOD WAS JUST TOO GOOD and I wanted to endure every chew.  The hollandaise sauce was so unique to me because it didn't taste so bland, and having it be mixed with the tangy gravy sauce that accompanied the steak made the whole forkful even better.  The wait was worth it.  The service is great.  The food is better.  I am at a loss for words at how outstanding my meal was.  A must-visit for ALL tourists!Staff&service 4 / 5  food 4 / 5 decor 4 / 5 I get why there's a big hype for tourists. . the decor is cool, the menus are funky looking and the combinations of food are odd but tasty.  However the lineups are long and the time to get the menus is long too.  If you're visiting montreal I recommend it but if you are from the area don't bother, go somewhere else. In Montreal for the week with family.  We decided to get some breakfast and looked this place up.  I ordered the Classic Eggs Benedict which was amazing.  The service was also great since we didn't really speak French that well and they were extremely helpful!Always. . . totally worth it! Dress warm from October on cuz its at least 20 minutes wait outside!I was confused as to how so many Montreal restaurants get near perfect ratings but I think I understand why.  They really do deliver! not just because the people there are so nice!Although we did wait in the cold on a Saturday morning for around 1. 5 hours, I can assure you that the food is worth the wait.  The eggs bennies are poaches to perfection and the hollandaise sauce is so smooth and creamy.  It's pure heaven on a plate.  The potatoes are seasoned nicely and everything just goes together really well.  It was the best brunch I have eaten.  There are ones in New York that are comparable but I would say that the flavours are not as "full of life", if that makes sense.  It's fresh but still extremely satisfying.  I think I'm going here each time I go to Montreal!Wait? What wait? So let me start by saying: expect to wait.  For like, an hour and a half.  Outside.  In the elements.  Now let me continue by saying, once you do make it inside, and that food touches your lips. . .  I swear it's sprinkled with mermaid kisses and instant amnesia dust.  That wait because ancient history.  I went with a group of about 8 for a friend of mines birthday (that was actually the entire reason I was in Montreal to begin with) and we found this place on Yelp! We already knew about the long line so we decided to take it in shifts.  A few people would wait while the rest would wonder and explore.  So we make it inside after waiting for a little over an hour, and wait a pleasant surprise.  The decor is super fun, colorful, and full of American satire.  The menu, like most things in Montreal is in French but the waitress, Elise I believe her name was, she was a doll! She explained and translated everything.  Everyone on my party ordered different variations of the egg Benedict.  I have never tasted something so delicious and flavorful yep beautiful for breakfast/brunch ever.  We went on to enjoy or food and two bottles of champagne we ordered for mimosas.  I'm going to assume Elise overheard our convo about the birthday celebration because at the end of the meal she brought out a complimentary round of shots! What a sweetie! This place was amazing! The food was ridiculously delicious, the service was impeccable, and the setting was trendy yet cozy.  If I lived in the area or visit Montreal again I will absolutely going back.  ps.  The bathrooms are crazy trippy!The.  Best.  Breakfast.   I used Yelp to locate the best place for a birthday brunch and L'Avenue was the number one hit.   Every review recommends an EARLY arrival on the weekends, and I can confirm that arriving before 10am on a Saturday is the best route for fast seating (ask to be in the back away from the door/draft!).   Quirky hipster ambiance (with suspended bicycles and massive maple syrup canisters) will make you feel like you're one of the cool kids.   Professional nom-worthy menu (with benedicts and waffles and omelets) will make you feel like one of the fat kids (in a good way). Order up an adult milkshake (with boooooooooooze) then tuck in and get ready to let your pants out.   The homefries: perfectly seasoned.   The waffle with nutella: what dreams are made of.   The omelet: large enough to feed a small family.   It's a large menu with something for everyone and prices that won't break the bank. Whatever you do. . . . . . go to the bathroom.   The coolest pee experience you'll ever have (unless you've used those one-way-mirror public potties. . . . in which case this will be the SECOND best pee experience!).   No more hints. . . . . just enjoy. . . . Usually when you see incredible long line outside a restaurant you tell yourself "ok this is the new hype" but this is place is the exception.  People are standing outside in line even in winter and its not for nothing. The food is outstanding, huge portions (I always split with my wife and we both are full at the end) and the quality is outstanding.  I gave it a 4 star and not 5 only because the long lines take some out of the experience.  Try the amazing natural shakes, out of this world egg benedicts and outstanding pancakes.  This is the place for brunch in Montreal. Came here for brunch while visiting Montréal after looking on Yelp.  This place had one of the highest reviews.  We got in line just in time before it got too crazy (before 10am).  The menu was in french only, so I brushed up on some of my high school french to make out what was on the menu.  The decor in the restaurant was unique.  They gave us a fruit "appetizer" which resembled a fruit kabob.  It was good.  We got one of their mixed fruity drinks/smoothie, which tasted good but nothing memorable.  I liked that their water was watermelon infused, it tasted refreshing.  *Disclaimer* I think I'm a little spoiled since there are many fantastic brunch places in Philly.  I had a very tasty french toast topped with fresh fruit! One of us got the cappuccino which was rich and came with a small piece of chocolate.  We ordered  several savory brunch dishes which was good but again nothing too memorable.  The service was just okay.  I think one of the most memorable things was strangely their blue lit creepy bathroom.  We saw several people go in at once to take pictures.  It was unique. . .  but again slightly creepy.  Despite not being too impressed, I had a decent experience.  I will probably not come back again since I don't regularly visit Montréal.  If I come back, I will probably explore some other brunch places in the area. Fantastic restaurant!!! My friend and I visited there around 9:30 am.  There was a line up outside, but luckily we only waited for 15 mins to have a seat.  The menu's design was interesting and the waitress provided us an English one.  We asked if we can order only one smoked salmon Benedict eggs to share.  The staff was really nice and told us they can help to separate the food into two parts and both of us can have fruit and fries by adding only 2$.  We certainly say YES.  When the food coming into our table, we felt so   satisfied because it looked so gooood!!The hollandaise sauce was very creamy, the egg was boiled perfectly, fruits were sweet and fresh, fries were not greasy.  Everything was delicious. Oh! BTW, even their washroom is awesome too.  Fluorescent painting on the wall~ Best breakfast made our Montreal to a perfection!Best breakfast food ever. Omelets , panacakes, there were 4 of us and we couldnt even get up to leave. Oh.  My.  God.  Yum.  I went here on a Thursday for brunch with a friend and the reviews were right, this place is amazing.  The waiter explained how they really put an emphasis on ensuring the best quality food, and this showed when we got our food.  I arrived before my friend and was worried I would have to wait for her before I could get seated (there was only one couple in front of me when I arrived) but I asked the waiter and he said I didn't have to wait and seated me right by the window.  He was very friendly and helpful.  I had the French toast with bananas caramelized in captain Morgan rum, with Nutella and a sauce (which a believe had rum also) with real pieces of coconut on top.  The flavors went so well together and weren't overly sweet tasting.  The portion size was big, I wasn't able to finish my plate.  I was surprised this place was even able to accommodate my friend who has so many restrictions (doesn't eat gluten, vegetarian, and lactose intolerant).  She ordered the eggs Benedict with all vegetables, substituted the English muffins for portobello mushrooms ($2 charge) and swapped out her potatoes for a salad ($1 charge).  I had read someone's review saying the bathrooms will give you nightmares, so of course I had to check them out, and they're awesome.  There was a lot of water on the floor though :/ I will definitely be back here.  I'd suggest going on a weekday before 11am to avoid a huge lineup. Canadian brunchBagels can be got laterNow benedict timeI did my very best in Montreal to make sure every meal was a 5 star meal, and this brunch was no exception.  Show up early for a seat, the line goes out the door.  We were right on time to be seated as a party of 8, and we were treated awesomely.  The duck benedict, salmon benedict, gluten-free pancake, omelettes, coffee, smoothies, all incredible.  If you're looking for a great local brunch spot, this place is worth the distance traveled.  Also, the bathroom is absolutely terrifying. Je suis triste -  I wish L'Avenue was in Toronto.   We came here at around 10:30am, arriving to a lineup of roughly 8-10 people ahead of us, which moved relatively quickly (maybe a 15 minute wait, at max?).   Appreciated that despite the short wait, there's a cooler with ice water available at the front of the line for any overheated guests waiting for a table.  Which takes me to the next point: seemingly superfluous details are far from lost.   Himalayan pink salt sits in the table salt shakers instead of regular ol' stinky salt.   Water inside comes from a huge, clear plastic cube dispenser, with whole rounds of watermelon floating inside to flavour the water.   Cafe latte glacee, which I thought would simply be caffe latte poured over ice, actually came in a large glass and blended, like an iced capp but much less sweet.  A free skewer of fresh fruit will serve as your appetizer, regardless of whatever dish you might've ordered.  My pick for the day was the eggs Benedict "Tout L'Monde a Poele": Two huge mounds of sautéed mushrooms, bacon on English muffins topped with two poached eggs.  Sadly, a couple of our eggs were overcooked.  The hubs had the eggs Benedict with the truffle. . . before I ate the tiny bit of black truffle shavings on top, because I'm a monster like that.   The hollandaise, while I have to admit wasn't the best I've had, was also not the worst - it actually tasted of butter.  Both bennys were delicious.  My tips:- Menus are in French, I'm not sure whether or not they have English menus available.   If this puts you off, I suggest reading their menu online so you can Google in advance.  - If French is not your forte, when greeted by waitstaff, make sure you reply in English.   If you answer in French, be prepared to speak French the rest of the time you're there.  - Come early-ish! Pretty much anything past 11 and you're in line for the long haul.  Portions are large, so warm up your belly before you come here.   Bon appetit!Ahhhhhhmazing!! Is all I can say.  Best salmon egg benedict I've ever had.  They give you fruit to start with, which was very lovely and delicious! Great way to start the day.  My friend and I were visiting Montréal from Massachusetts and we stumbled upon this place on Yelp.  Saw the reviews and needed to go! Be aware that you will most likely wait in a line, but if you're with one or two people you can get in sooner.  The menu is in all French (had to google translate some stuff) but the waitress helped us find what we wanted.  My friend got the Idaho omelette and she said it was the most intricate omelette she ever had haha so many flavors and ingredients!! I got the salmon benedict and almost died.  Literally.  It was so good!! The hash browns are home made, too and they put some seasoning in it that will make you want more.  This place is the spot for breakfast/brunch!!This was the last establishment that my friends and I had hit up prior to our long drive back to NYC.  We had thought about eating here earlier, but was scared off by the super long queues the day prior.  We figured there wouldn't be as long of a wait on a Monday morning, and we were right.  We were seated almost immediately upon reaching the restaurant. Aside from the eclectic decor, the menu offers plenty of different options to suit most palates.  I got their truffled mushroom omelette, which I thought erred a little on the bland side, though the mushrooms themselves were delicious.  The potatoes that came with my dish were also good, but at this point in my trip, I kind of never wanted to see another potato again.  Portions were gargantuan so I definitely felt like I got my money's worth, but I thought the food would've been jaw-droppingly awesome considering how long the queues had been just the day before, and presumably every weekend.  I'm not sure I would've waited for more than half an hour for the meal I had been served, to be quite honest, so I was especially glad that I didn't have to wait when we actually ate here.

We had thought about eating here earlier, but was scared off by the super long queues the day prior.  We figured there wouldn't be as long of a wait on a Monday morning, and we were right.  We were seated almost immediately upon reaching the restaurant. Aside from the eclectic decor, the menu offers plenty of different options to suit most palates.  I got their truffled mushroom omelette, which I thought erred a little on the bland side, though the mushrooms themselves were delicious.  The potatoes that came with my dish were also good, but at this point in my trip, I kind of never wanted to see another potato again.  Portions were gargantuan so I definitely felt like I got my money's worth, but I thought the food would've been jaw-droppingly awesome considering how long the queues had been just the day before, and presumably every weekend.  I'm not sure I would've waited for more than half an hour for the meal I had been served, to be quite honest, so I was especially glad that I didn't have to wait when we actually ate here. Service was excellent, though, and the bathrooms were also quite interesting.  Oh, and every entree comes with fruit skewers and watermelon flavored water.  3. 5 stars, really. Amazing benedict on French toast! Staff are attentive and friendly.  Smoothies are at good value!Loved the decor in this restaurant- it was retro with graffiti/art all over the walls and a motorcycle hanging above our heads.  We waited over an hour (as expected) to get a table here.  Luckily the weather was beautiful, and they had free fresh lemonade for anyone in line.  The space was a little cramped, and once we were seated, we still had to wait for menus since they didn't have enough. I had very high expectations for the food because everyone raved about it being the best brunch spot in Montreal.  My bf and I shared a smoothie, which was okay, but it had too much raspberry flavor, and I didn't taste whatever else the waitress described it having (supposedly strawberry, basil, etc).  What was nice though is that they give you a free plate of fruit on a skewer.  I got the steak and eggs benedict with potatoes.  The potatoes were probably the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had- they were cooked perfectly and had a hint of salty and sweet flavor to them.  For my steak and eggs (and mushrooms) benedict, it was delicious.  However, my poached eggs were overcooked and they didn't ooze out like they were supposed to.  This was a little disappointing, but overall I still enjoyed my meal here. Decor is fun, hip and trendy.  The restaurant has a laid back vibe and from what I saw, seems to always draw a large crowd.  My boyfriend got the steak and eggs and I got the veggie omelette.  Both dishes were good, nothing outstanding but the restaurant is worth checking out for travelers.  And be sure to take a look at the bathroom!With the waiting time outside, the cold, and the long ass line of people, my patience and my expectations was really really high.  After 45min of waiting, finally a seat.  But HOLY MOTHER OF GOD.  Probably the best brunch I had.  Quality is high as hell, flavour are perfectly mix, top presentation, nice ambiance, i wish I had something bad to say but can't find any.  45min? 30 min of wait? Go for it.  You won't regret it. BEST EGGS BENEDICT EVER. The line outside the door at around 10:30 am was pretty long; I'd say we waited maybe 20-30 minutes? The longer I waited, the higher my standards were for this place, to be honest! The ambiance is pretty interesting--a floating motorcycle above one table, a colorful mannequin at the window, and the whole place seemed to rely mostly on sunlight from the windows.  My boyfriend has been here before and he recommended that I get the steak and mushroom benedict.  I did, and we also got complimentary assorted fruits on a skewer.  The water tasted strange, and we assumed it was maybe infused with fruit before hand or something, but it wasn't bad.  When my eggs benedict came out, it smelled AMAZING.  At both ends of the plate were sliced English muffins, with the eggs benedict on top and the tender steak and mushrooms topped everything else (it also had its own type of gravy, which mixed in with the hollandaise sauce).  In the middle of the plate was a small cup of roasted potatoes.  First bite I took, I tried tasting the egg, muffin, a piece of steak and a piece of mushroom simultaneously and I couldn't keep up a conversation with our friends--THE FOOD WAS JUST TOO GOOD and I wanted to endure every chew.  The hollandaise sauce was so unique to me because it didn't taste so bland, and having it be mixed with the tangy gravy sauce that accompanied the steak made the whole forkful even better.  The wait was worth it.  The service is great.  The food is better.  I am at a loss for words at how outstanding my meal was.  A must-visit for ALL tourists!Staff&service 4 / 5  food 4 / 5 decor 4 / 5 I get why there's a big hype for tourists. . the decor is cool, the menus are funky looking and the combinations of food are odd but tasty.  However the lineups are long and the time to get the menus is long too.  If you're visiting montreal I recommend it but if you are from the area don't bother, go somewhere else. In Montreal for the week with family.  We decided to get some breakfast and looked this place up.  I ordered the Classic Eggs Benedict which was amazing.  The service was also great since we didn't really speak French that well and they were extremely helpful!Always. . . totally worth it! Dress warm from October on cuz its at least 20 minutes wait outside!I was confused as to how so many Montreal restaurants get near perfect ratings but I think I understand why.  They really do deliver! not just because the people there are so nice!Although we did wait in the cold on a Saturday morning for around 1. 5 hours, I can assure you that the food is worth the wait.  The eggs bennies are poaches to perfection and the hollandaise sauce is so smooth and creamy.  It's pure heaven on a plate.  The potatoes are seasoned nicely and everything just goes together really well.  It was the best brunch I have eaten.  There are ones in New York that are comparable but I would say that the flavours are not as "full of life", if that makes sense.  It's fresh but still extremely satisfying.  I think I'm going here each time I go to Montreal!Wait? What wait? So let me start by saying: expect to wait.  For like, an hour and a half.  Outside.  In the elements.  Now let me continue by saying, once you do make it inside, and that food touches your lips. . .  I swear it's sprinkled with mermaid kisses and instant amnesia dust.  That wait because ancient history.  I went with a group of about 8 for a friend of mines birthday (that was actually the entire reason I was in Montreal to begin with) and we found this place on Yelp! We already knew about the long line so we decided to take it in shifts.  A few people would wait while the rest would wonder and explore.  So we make it inside after waiting for a little over an hour, and wait a pleasant surprise.  The decor is super fun, colorful, and full of American satire.  The menu, like most things in Montreal is in French but the waitress, Elise I believe her name was, she was a doll! She explained and translated everything.  Everyone on my party ordered different variations of the egg Benedict.  I have never tasted something so delicious and flavorful yep beautiful for breakfast/brunch ever.  We went on to enjoy or food and two bottles of champagne we ordered for mimosas.  I'm going to assume Elise overheard our convo about the birthday celebration because at the end of the meal she brought out a complimentary round of shots! What a sweetie! This place was amazing! The food was ridiculously delicious, the service was impeccable, and the setting was trendy yet cozy.  If I lived in the area or visit Montreal again I will absolutely going back.  ps.  The bathrooms are crazy trippy!The.  Best.  Breakfast.   I used Yelp to locate the best place for a birthday brunch and L'Avenue was the number one hit.   Every review recommends an EARLY arrival on the weekends, and I can confirm that arriving before 10am on a Saturday is the best route for fast seating (ask to be in the back away from the door/draft!).   Quirky hipster ambiance (with suspended bicycles and massive maple syrup canisters) will make you feel like you're one of the cool kids.   Professional nom-worthy menu (with benedicts and waffles and omelets) will make you feel like one of the fat kids (in a good way). Order up an adult milkshake (with boooooooooooze) then tuck in and get ready to let your pants out.   The homefries: perfectly seasoned.   The waffle with nutella: what dreams are made of.   The omelet: large enough to feed a small family.   It's a large menu with something for everyone and prices that won't break the bank. Whatever you do. . . . . . go to the bathroom.   The coolest pee experience you'll ever have (unless you've used those one-way-mirror public potties. . . . in which case this will be the SECOND best pee experience!).   No more hints. . . . . just enjoy. . . . Usually when you see incredible long line outside a restaurant you tell yourself "ok this is the new hype" but this is place is the exception.  People are standing outside in line even in winter and its not for nothing. The food is outstanding, huge portions (I always split with my wife and we both are full at the end) and the quality is outstanding.  I gave it a 4 star and not 5 only because the long lines take some out of the experience.  Try the amazing natural shakes, out of this world egg benedicts and outstanding pancakes.  This is the place for brunch in Montreal. Came here for brunch while visiting Montréal after looking on Yelp.  This place had one of the highest reviews.  We got in line just in time before it got too crazy (before 10am).  The menu was in french only, so I brushed up on some of my high school french to make out what was on the menu.  The decor in the restaurant was unique.  They gave us a fruit "appetizer" which resembled a fruit kabob.  It was good.  We got one of their mixed fruity drinks/smoothie, which tasted good but nothing memorable.  I liked that their water was watermelon infused, it tasted refreshing.  *Disclaimer* I think I'm a little spoiled since there are many fantastic brunch places in Philly.  I had a very tasty french toast topped with fresh fruit! One of us got the cappuccino which was rich and came with a small piece of chocolate.  We ordered  several savory brunch dishes which was good but again nothing too memorable.  The service was just okay.  I think one of the most memorable things was strangely their blue lit creepy bathroom.  We saw several people go in at once to take pictures.  It was unique. . .  but again slightly creepy.  Despite not being too impressed, I had a decent experience.  I will probably not come back again since I don't regularly visit Montréal.  If I come back, I will probably explore some other brunch places in the area. Fantastic restaurant!!! My friend and I visited there around 9:30 am.  There was a line up outside, but luckily we only waited for 15 mins to have a seat.  The menu's design was interesting and the waitress provided us an English one.  We asked if we can order only one smoked salmon Benedict eggs to share.  The staff was really nice and told us they can help to separate the food into two parts and both of us can have fruit and fries by adding only 2$.  We certainly say YES.  When the food coming into our table, we felt so   satisfied because it looked so gooood!!The hollandaise sauce was very creamy, the egg was boiled perfectly, fruits were sweet and fresh, fries were not greasy.  Everything was delicious. Oh! BTW, even their washroom is awesome too.  Fluorescent painting on the wall~ Best breakfast made our Montreal to a perfection!Best breakfast food ever. Omelets , panacakes, there were 4 of us and we couldnt even get up to leave. Oh.  My.  God.  Yum.  I went here on a Thursday for brunch with a friend and the reviews were right, this place is amazing.  The waiter explained how they really put an emphasis on ensuring the best quality food, and this showed when we got our food.  I arrived before my friend and was worried I would have to wait for her before I could get seated (there was only one couple in front of me when I arrived) but I asked the waiter and he said I didn't have to wait and seated me right by the window.  He was very friendly and helpful.  I had the French toast with bananas caramelized in captain Morgan rum, with Nutella and a sauce (which a believe had rum also) with real pieces of coconut on top.  The flavors went so well together and weren't overly sweet tasting.  The portion size was big, I wasn't able to finish my plate.  I was surprised this place was even able to accommodate my friend who has so many restrictions (doesn't eat gluten, vegetarian, and lactose intolerant).  She ordered the eggs Benedict with all vegetables, substituted the English muffins for portobello mushrooms ($2 charge) and swapped out her potatoes for a salad ($1 charge).  I had read someone's review saying the bathrooms will give you nightmares, so of course I had to check them out, and they're awesome.  There was a lot of water on the floor though :/ I will definitely be back here.  I'd suggest going on a weekday before 11am to avoid a huge lineup. Canadian brunchBagels can be got laterNow benedict timeI did my very best in Montreal to make sure every meal was a 5 star meal, and this brunch was no exception.  Show up early for a seat, the line goes out the door.  We were right on time to be seated as a party of 8, and we were treated awesomely.  The duck benedict, salmon benedict, gluten-free pancake, omelettes, coffee, smoothies, all incredible.  If you're looking for a great local brunch spot, this place is worth the distance traveled.  Also, the bathroom is absolutely terrifying. Je suis triste -  I wish L'Avenue was in Toronto.   We came here at around 10:30am, arriving to a lineup of roughly 8-10 people ahead of us, which moved relatively quickly (maybe a 15 minute wait, at max?).   Appreciated that despite the short wait, there's a cooler with ice water available at the front of the line for any overheated guests waiting for a table.  Which takes me to the next point: seemingly superfluous details are far from lost.   Himalayan pink salt sits in the table salt shakers instead of regular ol' stinky salt.   Water inside comes from a huge, clear plastic cube dispenser, with whole rounds of watermelon floating inside to flavour the water.   Cafe latte glacee, which I thought would simply be caffe latte poured over ice, actually came in a large glass and blended, like an iced capp but much less sweet.  A free skewer of fresh fruit will serve as your appetizer, regardless of whatever dish you might've ordered.  My pick for the day was the eggs Benedict "Tout L'Monde a Poele": Two huge mounds of sautéed mushrooms, bacon on English muffins topped with two poached eggs.  Sadly, a couple of our eggs were overcooked.  The hubs had the eggs Benedict with the truffle. . . before I ate the tiny bit of black truffle shavings on top, because I'm a monster like that.   The hollandaise, while I have to admit wasn't the best I've had, was also not the worst - it actually tasted of butter.  Both bennys were delicious.  My tips:- Menus are in French, I'm not sure whether or not they have English menus available.   If this puts you off, I suggest reading their menu online so you can Google in advance.  - If French is not your forte, when greeted by waitstaff, make sure you reply in English.   If you answer in French, be prepared to speak French the rest of the time you're there.  - Come early-ish! Pretty much anything past 11 and you're in line for the long haul.  Portions are large, so warm up your belly before you come here.   Bon appetit!Ahhhhhhmazing!! Is all I can say.  Best salmon egg benedict I've ever had.  They give you fruit to start with, which was very lovely and delicious! Great way to start the day.  My friend and I were visiting Montréal from Massachusetts and we stumbled upon this place on Yelp.  Saw the reviews and needed to go! Be aware that you will most likely wait in a line, but if you're with one or two people you can get in sooner.  The menu is in all French (had to google translate some stuff) but the waitress helped us find what we wanted.  My friend got the Idaho omelette and she said it was the most intricate omelette she ever had haha so many flavors and ingredients!! I got the salmon benedict and almost died.  Literally.  It was so good!! The hash browns are home made, too and they put some seasoning in it that will make you want more.  This place is the spot for breakfast/brunch!!This was the last establishment that my friends and I had hit up prior to our long drive back to NYC.

Best salmon egg benedict I've ever had.  They give you fruit to start with, which was very lovely and delicious! Great way to start the day.  My friend and I were visiting Montréal from Massachusetts and we stumbled upon this place on Yelp.  Saw the reviews and needed to go! Be aware that you will most likely wait in a line, but if you're with one or two people you can get in sooner.  The menu is in all French (had to google translate some stuff) but the waitress helped us find what we wanted.  My friend got the Idaho omelette and she said it was the most intricate omelette she ever had haha so many flavors and ingredients!! I got the salmon benedict and almost died.  Literally.  It was so good!! The hash browns are home made, too and they put some seasoning in it that will make you want more.  This place is the spot for breakfast/brunch!!This was the last establishment that my friends and I had hit up prior to our long drive back to NYC.  We had thought about eating here earlier, but was scared off by the super long queues the day prior.  We figured there wouldn't be as long of a wait on a Monday morning, and we were right.  We were seated almost immediately upon reaching the restaurant. Aside from the eclectic decor, the menu offers plenty of different options to suit most palates.  I got their truffled mushroom omelette, which I thought erred a little on the bland side, though the mushrooms themselves were delicious.  The potatoes that came with my dish were also good, but at this point in my trip, I kind of never wanted to see another potato again.  Portions were gargantuan so I definitely felt like I got my money's worth, but I thought the food would've been jaw-droppingly awesome considering how long the queues had been just the day before, and presumably every weekend.  I'm not sure I would've waited for more than half an hour for the meal I had been served, to be quite honest, so I was especially glad that I didn't have to wait when we actually ate here. Service was excellent, though, and the bathrooms were also quite interesting.  Oh, and every entree comes with fruit skewers and watermelon flavored water.  3. 5 stars, really. Amazing benedict on French toast! Staff are attentive and friendly.  Smoothies are at good value!Loved the decor in this restaurant- it was retro with graffiti/art all over the walls and a motorcycle hanging above our heads.  We waited over an hour (as expected) to get a table here.  Luckily the weather was beautiful, and they had free fresh lemonade for anyone in line.  The space was a little cramped, and once we were seated, we still had to wait for menus since they didn't have enough. I had very high expectations for the food because everyone raved about it being the best brunch spot in Montreal.  My bf and I shared a smoothie, which was okay, but it had too much raspberry flavor, and I didn't taste whatever else the waitress described it having (supposedly strawberry, basil, etc).  What was nice though is that they give you a free plate of fruit on a skewer.  I got the steak and eggs benedict with potatoes.  The potatoes were probably the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had- they were cooked perfectly and had a hint of salty and sweet flavor to them.  For my steak and eggs (and mushrooms) benedict, it was delicious.  However, my poached eggs were overcooked and they didn't ooze out like they were supposed to.  This was a little disappointing, but overall I still enjoyed my meal here. Decor is fun, hip and trendy.  The restaurant has a laid back vibe and from what I saw, seems to always draw a large crowd.  My boyfriend got the steak and eggs and I got the veggie omelette.  Both dishes were good, nothing outstanding but the restaurant is worth checking out for travelers.  And be sure to take a look at the bathroom!With the waiting time outside, the cold, and the long ass line of people, my patience and my expectations was really really high.  After 45min of waiting, finally a seat.  But HOLY MOTHER OF GOD.  Probably the best brunch I had.  Quality is high as hell, flavour are perfectly mix, top presentation, nice ambiance, i wish I had something bad to say but can't find any.  45min? 30 min of wait? Go for it.  You won't regret it. BEST EGGS BENEDICT EVER. The line outside the door at around 10:30 am was pretty long; I'd say we waited maybe 20-30 minutes? The longer I waited, the higher my standards were for this place, to be honest! The ambiance is pretty interesting--a floating motorcycle above one table, a colorful mannequin at the window, and the whole place seemed to rely mostly on sunlight from the windows.  My boyfriend has been here before and he recommended that I get the steak and mushroom benedict.  I did, and we also got complimentary assorted fruits on a skewer.  The water tasted strange, and we assumed it was maybe infused with fruit before hand or something, but it wasn't bad.  When my eggs benedict came out, it smelled AMAZING.  At both ends of the plate were sliced English muffins, with the eggs benedict on top and the tender steak and mushrooms topped everything else (it also had its own type of gravy, which mixed in with the hollandaise sauce).  In the middle of the plate was a small cup of roasted potatoes.  First bite I took, I tried tasting the egg, muffin, a piece of steak and a piece of mushroom simultaneously and I couldn't keep up a conversation with our friends--THE FOOD WAS JUST TOO GOOD and I wanted to endure every chew.  The hollandaise sauce was so unique to me because it didn't taste so bland, and having it be mixed with the tangy gravy sauce that accompanied the steak made the whole forkful even better.  The wait was worth it.  The service is great.  The food is better.  I am at a loss for words at how outstanding my meal was.  A must-visit for ALL tourists!Staff&service 4 / 5  food 4 / 5 decor 4 / 5 I get why there's a big hype for tourists. . the decor is cool, the menus are funky looking and the combinations of food are odd but tasty.  However the lineups are long and the time to get the menus is long too.  If you're visiting montreal I recommend it but if you are from the area don't bother, go somewhere else. In Montreal for the week with family.  We decided to get some breakfast and looked this place up.  I ordered the Classic Eggs Benedict which was amazing.  The service was also great since we didn't really speak French that well and they were extremely helpful!Always. . . totally worth it! Dress warm from October on cuz its at least 20 minutes wait outside!I was confused as to how so many Montreal restaurants get near perfect ratings but I think I understand why.  They really do deliver! not just because the people there are so nice!Although we did wait in the cold on a Saturday morning for around 1. 5 hours, I can assure you that the food is worth the wait.  The eggs bennies are poaches to perfection and the hollandaise sauce is so smooth and creamy.  It's pure heaven on a plate.  The potatoes are seasoned nicely and everything just goes together really well.  It was the best brunch I have eaten.  There are ones in New York that are comparable but I would say that the flavours are not as "full of life", if that makes sense.  It's fresh but still extremely satisfying.  I think I'm going here each time I go to Montreal!Wait? What wait? So let me start by saying: expect to wait.  For like, an hour and a half.  Outside.  In the elements.  Now let me continue by saying, once you do make it inside, and that food touches your lips. . .  I swear it's sprinkled with mermaid kisses and instant amnesia dust.  That wait because ancient history.  I went with a group of about 8 for a friend of mines birthday (that was actually the entire reason I was in Montreal to begin with) and we found this place on Yelp! We already knew about the long line so we decided to take it in shifts.  A few people would wait while the rest would wonder and explore.  So we make it inside after waiting for a little over an hour, and wait a pleasant surprise.  The decor is super fun, colorful, and full of American satire.  The menu, like most things in Montreal is in French but the waitress, Elise I believe her name was, she was a doll! She explained and translated everything.  Everyone on my party ordered different variations of the egg Benedict.  I have never tasted something so delicious and flavorful yep beautiful for breakfast/brunch ever.  We went on to enjoy or food and two bottles of champagne we ordered for mimosas.  I'm going to assume Elise overheard our convo about the birthday celebration because at the end of the meal she brought out a complimentary round of shots! What a sweetie! This place was amazing! The food was ridiculously delicious, the service was impeccable, and the setting was trendy yet cozy.  If I lived in the area or visit Montreal again I will absolutely going back.  ps.  The bathrooms are crazy trippy!The.  Best.  Breakfast.   I used Yelp to locate the best place for a birthday brunch and L'Avenue was the number one hit.   Every review recommends an EARLY arrival on the weekends, and I can confirm that arriving before 10am on a Saturday is the best route for fast seating (ask to be in the back away from the door/draft!).   Quirky hipster ambiance (with suspended bicycles and massive maple syrup canisters) will make you feel like you're one of the cool kids.   Professional nom-worthy menu (with benedicts and waffles and omelets) will make you feel like one of the fat kids (in a good way). Order up an adult milkshake (with boooooooooooze) then tuck in and get ready to let your pants out.   The homefries: perfectly seasoned.   The waffle with nutella: what dreams are made of.   The omelet: large enough to feed a small family.   It's a large menu with something for everyone and prices that won't break the bank. Whatever you do. . . . . . go to the bathroom.   The coolest pee experience you'll ever have (unless you've used those one-way-mirror public potties. . . . in which case this will be the SECOND best pee experience!).   No more hints. . . . . just enjoy. . . . Usually when you see incredible long line outside a restaurant you tell yourself "ok this is the new hype" but this is place is the exception.  People are standing outside in line even in winter and its not for nothing. The food is outstanding, huge portions (I always split with my wife and we both are full at the end) and the quality is outstanding.  I gave it a 4 star and not 5 only because the long lines take some out of the experience.  Try the amazing natural shakes, out of this world egg benedicts and outstanding pancakes.  This is the place for brunch in Montreal. Came here for brunch while visiting Montréal after looking on Yelp.  This place had one of the highest reviews.  We got in line just in time before it got too crazy (before 10am).  The menu was in french only, so I brushed up on some of my high school french to make out what was on the menu.  The decor in the restaurant was unique.  They gave us a fruit "appetizer" which resembled a fruit kabob.  It was good.  We got one of their mixed fruity drinks/smoothie, which tasted good but nothing memorable.  I liked that their water was watermelon infused, it tasted refreshing.  *Disclaimer* I think I'm a little spoiled since there are many fantastic brunch places in Philly.  I had a very tasty french toast topped with fresh fruit! One of us got the cappuccino which was rich and came with a small piece of chocolate.  We ordered  several savory brunch dishes which was good but again nothing too memorable.  The service was just okay.  I think one of the most memorable things was strangely their blue lit creepy bathroom.  We saw several people go in at once to take pictures.  It was unique. . .  but again slightly creepy.  Despite not being too impressed, I had a decent experience.  I will probably not come back again since I don't regularly visit Montréal.  If I come back, I will probably explore some other brunch places in the area. Fantastic restaurant!!! My friend and I visited there around 9:30 am.  There was a line up outside, but luckily we only waited for 15 mins to have a seat.  The menu's design was interesting and the waitress provided us an English one.  We asked if we can order only one smoked salmon Benedict eggs to share.  The staff was really nice and told us they can help to separate the food into two parts and both of us can have fruit and fries by adding only 2$.  We certainly say YES.  When the food coming into our table, we felt so   satisfied because it looked so gooood!!The hollandaise sauce was very creamy, the egg was boiled perfectly, fruits were sweet and fresh, fries were not greasy.  Everything was delicious. Oh! BTW, even their washroom is awesome too.  Fluorescent painting on the wall~ Best breakfast made our Montreal to a perfection!Best breakfast food ever. Omelets , panacakes, there were 4 of us and we couldnt even get up to leave. Oh.  My.  God.  Yum.  I went here on a Thursday for brunch with a friend and the reviews were right, this place is amazing.  The waiter explained how they really put an emphasis on ensuring the best quality food, and this showed when we got our food.  I arrived before my friend and was worried I would have to wait for her before I could get seated (there was only one couple in front of me when I arrived) but I asked the waiter and he said I didn't have to wait and seated me right by the window.  He was very friendly and helpful.  I had the French toast with bananas caramelized in captain Morgan rum, with Nutella and a sauce (which a believe had rum also) with real pieces of coconut on top.  The flavors went so well together and weren't overly sweet tasting.  The portion size was big, I wasn't able to finish my plate.  I was surprised this place was even able to accommodate my friend who has so many restrictions (doesn't eat gluten, vegetarian, and lactose intolerant).  She ordered the eggs Benedict with all vegetables, substituted the English muffins for portobello mushrooms ($2 charge) and swapped out her potatoes for a salad ($1 charge).  I had read someone's review saying the bathrooms will give you nightmares, so of course I had to check them out, and they're awesome.  There was a lot of water on the floor though :/ I will definitely be back here.  I'd suggest going on a weekday before 11am to avoid a huge lineup. Canadian brunchBagels can be got laterNow benedict timeI did my very best in Montreal to make sure every meal was a 5 star meal, and this brunch was no exception.  Show up early for a seat, the line goes out the door.  We were right on time to be seated as a party of 8, and we were treated awesomely.  The duck benedict, salmon benedict, gluten-free pancake, omelettes, coffee, smoothies, all incredible.  If you're looking for a great local brunch spot, this place is worth the distance traveled.  Also, the bathroom is absolutely terrifying. Je suis triste -  I wish L'Avenue was in Toronto.   We came here at around 10:30am, arriving to a lineup of roughly 8-10 people ahead of us, which moved relatively quickly (maybe a 15 minute wait, at max?).   Appreciated that despite the short wait, there's a cooler with ice water available at the front of the line for any overheated guests waiting for a table.  Which takes me to the next point: seemingly superfluous details are far from lost.   Himalayan pink salt sits in the table salt shakers instead of regular ol' stinky salt.   Water inside comes from a huge, clear plastic cube dispenser, with whole rounds of watermelon floating inside to flavour the water.   Cafe latte glacee, which I thought would simply be caffe latte poured over ice, actually came in a large glass and blended, like an iced capp but much less sweet.  A free skewer of fresh fruit will serve as your appetizer, regardless of whatever dish you might've ordered.  My pick for the day was the eggs Benedict "Tout L'Monde a Poele": Two huge mounds of sautéed mushrooms, bacon on English muffins topped with two poached eggs.  Sadly, a couple of our eggs were overcooked.  The hubs had the eggs Benedict with the truffle. . . before I ate the tiny bit of black truffle shavings on top, because I'm a monster like that.   The hollandaise, while I have to admit wasn't the best I've had, was also not the worst - it actually tasted of butter.  Both bennys were delicious.  My tips:- Menus are in French, I'm not sure whether or not they have English menus available.   If this puts you off, I suggest reading their menu online so you can Google in advance.  - If French is not your forte, when greeted by waitstaff, make sure you reply in English.   If you answer in French, be prepared to speak French the rest of the time you're there.  - Come early-ish!

A free skewer of fresh fruit will serve as your appetizer, regardless of whatever dish you might've ordered.  My pick for the day was the eggs Benedict "Tout L'Monde a Poele": Two huge mounds of sautéed mushrooms, bacon on English muffins topped with two poached eggs.  Sadly, a couple of our eggs were overcooked.  The hubs had the eggs Benedict with the truffle. . . before I ate the tiny bit of black truffle shavings on top, because I'm a monster like that.   The hollandaise, while I have to admit wasn't the best I've had, was also not the worst - it actually tasted of butter.  Both bennys were delicious.  My tips:- Menus are in French, I'm not sure whether or not they have English menus available.   If this puts you off, I suggest reading their menu online so you can Google in advance.  - If French is not your forte, when greeted by waitstaff, make sure you reply in English.   If you answer in French, be prepared to speak French the rest of the time you're there.  - Come early-ish! Pretty much anything past 11 and you're in line for the long haul.  Portions are large, so warm up your belly before you come here.   Bon appetit!Ahhhhhhmazing!! Is all I can say.  Best salmon egg benedict I've ever had.  They give you fruit to start with, which was very lovely and delicious! Great way to start the day.  My friend and I were visiting Montréal from Massachusetts and we stumbled upon this place on Yelp.  Saw the reviews and needed to go! Be aware that you will most likely wait in a line, but if you're with one or two people you can get in sooner.  The menu is in all French (had to google translate some stuff) but the waitress helped us find what we wanted.  My friend got the Idaho omelette and she said it was the most intricate omelette she ever had haha so many flavors and ingredients!! I got the salmon benedict and almost died.  Literally.  It was so good!! The hash browns are home made, too and they put some seasoning in it that will make you want more.  This place is the spot for breakfast/brunch!!This was the last establishment that my friends and I had hit up prior to our long drive back to NYC.  We had thought about eating here earlier, but was scared off by the super long queues the day prior.  We figured there wouldn't be as long of a wait on a Monday morning, and we were right.  We were seated almost immediately upon reaching the restaurant. Aside from the eclectic decor, the menu offers plenty of different options to suit most palates.  I got their truffled mushroom omelette, which I thought erred a little on the bland side, though the mushrooms themselves were delicious.  The potatoes that came with my dish were also good, but at this point in my trip, I kind of never wanted to see another potato again.  Portions were gargantuan so I definitely felt like I got my money's worth, but I thought the food would've been jaw-droppingly awesome considering how long the queues had been just the day before, and presumably every weekend.  I'm not sure I would've waited for more than half an hour for the meal I had been served, to be quite honest, so I was especially glad that I didn't have to wait when we actually ate here. Service was excellent, though, and the bathrooms were also quite interesting.  Oh, and every entree comes with fruit skewers and watermelon flavored water.  3. 5 stars, really. Amazing benedict on French toast! Staff are attentive and friendly.  Smoothies are at good value!Loved the decor in this restaurant- it was retro with graffiti/art all over the walls and a motorcycle hanging above our heads.  We waited over an hour (as expected) to get a table here.  Luckily the weather was beautiful, and they had free fresh lemonade for anyone in line.  The space was a little cramped, and once we were seated, we still had to wait for menus since they didn't have enough. I had very high expectations for the food because everyone raved about it being the best brunch spot in Montreal.  My bf and I shared a smoothie, which was okay, but it had too much raspberry flavor, and I didn't taste whatever else the waitress described it having (supposedly strawberry, basil, etc).  What was nice though is that they give you a free plate of fruit on a skewer.  I got the steak and eggs benedict with potatoes.  The potatoes were probably the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had- they were cooked perfectly and had a hint of salty and sweet flavor to them.  For my steak and eggs (and mushrooms) benedict, it was delicious.  However, my poached eggs were overcooked and they didn't ooze out like they were supposed to.  This was a little disappointing, but overall I still enjoyed my meal here. Decor is fun, hip and trendy.  The restaurant has a laid back vibe and from what I saw, seems to always draw a large crowd.  My boyfriend got the steak and eggs and I got the veggie omelette.  Both dishes were good, nothing outstanding but the restaurant is worth checking out for travelers.  And be sure to take a look at the bathroom!With the waiting time outside, the cold, and the long ass line of people, my patience and my expectations was really really high.  After 45min of waiting, finally a seat.  But HOLY MOTHER OF GOD.  Probably the best brunch I had.  Quality is high as hell, flavour are perfectly mix, top presentation, nice ambiance, i wish I had something bad to say but can't find any.  45min? 30 min of wait? Go for it.  You won't regret it. BEST EGGS BENEDICT EVER. The line outside the door at around 10:30 am was pretty long; I'd say we waited maybe 20-30 minutes? The longer I waited, the higher my standards were for this place, to be honest! The ambiance is pretty interesting--a floating motorcycle above one table, a colorful mannequin at the window, and the whole place seemed to rely mostly on sunlight from the windows.  My boyfriend has been here before and he recommended that I get the steak and mushroom benedict.  I did, and we also got complimentary assorted fruits on a skewer.  The water tasted strange, and we assumed it was maybe infused with fruit before hand or something, but it wasn't bad.  When my eggs benedict came out, it smelled AMAZING.  At both ends of the plate were sliced English muffins, with the eggs benedict on top and the tender steak and mushrooms topped everything else (it also had its own type of gravy, which mixed in with the hollandaise sauce).  In the middle of the plate was a small cup of roasted potatoes.  First bite I took, I tried tasting the egg, muffin, a piece of steak and a piece of mushroom simultaneously and I couldn't keep up a conversation with our friends--THE FOOD WAS JUST TOO GOOD and I wanted to endure every chew.  The hollandaise sauce was so unique to me because it didn't taste so bland, and having it be mixed with the tangy gravy sauce that accompanied the steak made the whole forkful even better.  The wait was worth it.  The service is great.  The food is better.  I am at a loss for words at how outstanding my meal was.  A must-visit for ALL tourists!Staff&service 4 / 5  food 4 / 5 decor 4 / 5 I get why there's a big hype for tourists. . the decor is cool, the menus are funky looking and the combinations of food are odd but tasty.  However the lineups are long and the time to get the menus is long too.  If you're visiting montreal I recommend it but if you are from the area don't bother, go somewhere else. In Montreal for the week with family.  We decided to get some breakfast and looked this place up.  I ordered the Classic Eggs Benedict which was amazing.  The service was also great since we didn't really speak French that well and they were extremely helpful!Always. . . totally worth it! Dress warm from October on cuz its at least 20 minutes wait outside!I was confused as to how so many Montreal restaurants get near perfect ratings but I think I understand why.  They really do deliver! not just because the people there are so nice!Although we did wait in the cold on a Saturday morning for around 1. 5 hours, I can assure you that the food is worth the wait.  The eggs bennies are poaches to perfection and the hollandaise sauce is so smooth and creamy.  It's pure heaven on a plate.  The potatoes are seasoned nicely and everything just goes together really well.  It was the best brunch I have eaten.  There are ones in New York that are comparable but I would say that the flavours are not as "full of life", if that makes sense.  It's fresh but still extremely satisfying.  I think I'm going here each time I go to Montreal!Wait? What wait? So let me start by saying: expect to wait.  For like, an hour and a half.  Outside.  In the elements.  Now let me continue by saying, once you do make it inside, and that food touches your lips. . .  I swear it's sprinkled with mermaid kisses and instant amnesia dust.  That wait because ancient history.  I went with a group of about 8 for a friend of mines birthday (that was actually the entire reason I was in Montreal to begin with) and we found this place on Yelp! We already knew about the long line so we decided to take it in shifts.  A few people would wait while the rest would wonder and explore.  So we make it inside after waiting for a little over an hour, and wait a pleasant surprise.  The decor is super fun, colorful, and full of American satire.  The menu, like most things in Montreal is in French but the waitress, Elise I believe her name was, she was a doll! She explained and translated everything.  Everyone on my party ordered different variations of the egg Benedict.  I have never tasted something so delicious and flavorful yep beautiful for breakfast/brunch ever.  We went on to enjoy or food and two bottles of champagne we ordered for mimosas.  I'm going to assume Elise overheard our convo about the birthday celebration because at the end of the meal she brought out a complimentary round of shots! What a sweetie! This place was amazing! The food was ridiculously delicious, the service was impeccable, and the setting was trendy yet cozy.  If I lived in the area or visit Montreal again I will absolutely going back.  ps.  The bathrooms are crazy trippy!The.  Best.  Breakfast.   I used Yelp to locate the best place for a birthday brunch and L'Avenue was the number one hit.   Every review recommends an EARLY arrival on the weekends, and I can confirm that arriving before 10am on a Saturday is the best route for fast seating (ask to be in the back away from the door/draft!).   Quirky hipster ambiance (with suspended bicycles and massive maple syrup canisters) will make you feel like you're one of the cool kids.   Professional nom-worthy menu (with benedicts and waffles and omelets) will make you feel like one of the fat kids (in a good way). Order up an adult milkshake (with boooooooooooze) then tuck in and get ready to let your pants out.   The homefries: perfectly seasoned.   The waffle with nutella: what dreams are made of.   The omelet: large enough to feed a small family.   It's a large menu with something for everyone and prices that won't break the bank. Whatever you do. . . . . . go to the bathroom.   The coolest pee experience you'll ever have (unless you've used those one-way-mirror public potties. . . . in which case this will be the SECOND best pee experience!).   No more hints. . . . . just enjoy. . . . Usually when you see incredible long line outside a restaurant you tell yourself "ok this is the new hype" but this is place is the exception.  People are standing outside in line even in winter and its not for nothing. The food is outstanding, huge portions (I always split with my wife and we both are full at the end) and the quality is outstanding.  I gave it a 4 star and not 5 only because the long lines take some out of the experience.  Try the amazing natural shakes, out of this world egg benedicts and outstanding pancakes.  This is the place for brunch in Montreal. Came here for brunch while visiting Montréal after looking on Yelp.  This place had one of the highest reviews.  We got in line just in time before it got too crazy (before 10am).  The menu was in french only, so I brushed up on some of my high school french to make out what was on the menu.  The decor in the restaurant was unique.  They gave us a fruit "appetizer" which resembled a fruit kabob.  It was good.  We got one of their mixed fruity drinks/smoothie, which tasted good but nothing memorable.  I liked that their water was watermelon infused, it tasted refreshing.  *Disclaimer* I think I'm a little spoiled since there are many fantastic brunch places in Philly.  I had a very tasty french toast topped with fresh fruit! One of us got the cappuccino which was rich and came with a small piece of chocolate.  We ordered  several savory brunch dishes which was good but again nothing too memorable.  The service was just okay.  I think one of the most memorable things was strangely their blue lit creepy bathroom.  We saw several people go in at once to take pictures.  It was unique. . .  but again slightly creepy.  Despite not being too impressed, I had a decent experience.  I will probably not come back again since I don't regularly visit Montréal.  If I come back, I will probably explore some other brunch places in the area. Fantastic restaurant!!! My friend and I visited there around 9:30 am.  There was a line up outside, but luckily we only waited for 15 mins to have a seat.  The menu's design was interesting and the waitress provided us an English one.  We asked if we can order only one smoked salmon Benedict eggs to share.  The staff was really nice and told us they can help to separate the food into two parts and both of us can have fruit and fries by adding only 2$.  We certainly say YES.  When the food coming into our table, we felt so   satisfied because it looked so gooood!!The hollandaise sauce was very creamy, the egg was boiled perfectly, fruits were sweet and fresh, fries were not greasy.  Everything was delicious. Oh! BTW, even their washroom is awesome too.  Fluorescent painting on the wall~ Best breakfast made our Montreal to a perfection!Best breakfast food ever. Omelets , panacakes, there were 4 of us and we couldnt even get up to leave. Oh.  My.  God.  Yum.  I went here on a Thursday for brunch with a friend and the reviews were right, this place is amazing.  The waiter explained how they really put an emphasis on ensuring the best quality food, and this showed when we got our food.  I arrived before my friend and was worried I would have to wait for her before I could get seated (there was only one couple in front of me when I arrived) but I asked the waiter and he said I didn't have to wait and seated me right by the window.  He was very friendly and helpful.  I had the French toast with bananas caramelized in captain Morgan rum, with Nutella and a sauce (which a believe had rum also) with real pieces of coconut on top.  The flavors went so well together and weren't overly sweet tasting.  The portion size was big, I wasn't able to finish my plate.  I was surprised this place was even able to accommodate my friend who has so many restrictions (doesn't eat gluten, vegetarian, and lactose intolerant).  She ordered the eggs Benedict with all vegetables, substituted the English muffins for portobello mushrooms ($2 charge) and swapped out her potatoes for a salad ($1 charge).  I had read someone's review saying the bathrooms will give you nightmares, so of course I had to check them out, and they're awesome.  There was a lot of water on the floor though :/ I will definitely be back here.  I'd suggest going on a weekday before 11am to avoid a huge lineup. Canadian brunchBagels can be got laterNow benedict timeI did my very best in Montreal to make sure every meal was a 5 star meal, and this brunch was no exception.  Show up early for a seat, the line goes out the door.  We were right on time to be seated as a party of 8, and we were treated awesomely.  The duck benedict, salmon benedict, gluten-free pancake, omelettes, coffee, smoothies, all incredible.  If you're looking for a great local brunch spot, this place is worth the distance traveled.  Also, the bathroom is absolutely terrifying.
