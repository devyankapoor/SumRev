"Quite possibly the best pie I've had in my life!", said my friend after eating here (OK it was actually my internal monologue, but my friend did agree that the pie was delicious ;D). I'll admit, I'm new to the concept of pies as a meal, I've always associated pies with dessert.   Ta Pies make delectable meal-pies (I don't know if that's a thing but I'm going to run with it) in many varieties, for omnivores and vegetarians alike.   I really enjoyed the spinach, mushroom, tomato, and Ricotta cheese pie, as well as the curried vegetable pie.   I ordered some meat pies for some friends from work, the steak and mushroom, and the steak, bacon, and mushroom, and they raved about them.   Even I was tempted, based on the pies I had. This spot isn't limited to only pies, though, they also make a variety of desserts, salads, and most importantly milkshakes!  They even have a special one called a "thickshake" which they make with extra scoops of ice cream and a thickening agent.   The regular milkshake was good but damn was the thickshake fine!Ta Pies make single-serving as well as family size pies, and the pies are available hot, refrigerated, or frozen.   If you want to eat in or pick up a hot pie, it's best to call ahead because it takes 20 minutes to heat up, which they will do for you, so you can arrive and the pie will be ready to eat.   Mmmmmmm :DWhat are you waiting for?australian restaurant in the park avenue dead zone serving authentic australian pies and whatnot? and approved by mister aussie himself, hugh jackman? well, if he says so, must be fucking good! mind you, i've never had their pies so i can't tell but i had some of their desserts and they are indeed good. on the day i went, they had what they call long johns which picked my curiosity.  turns out, its a beignet, shaped like a small hot-dog bun, filled with whipped cream and a doll of strawberry jam dead center.  sounds and looks appetizing.  i didn't pay much attention at first but after having a good look and a decent picture out of it, that's when it hit me.  them aussies and their fucking sense of humor!i had one of their other stample, the yo-yo which is a shortbread cookie sandwich with passion fruit butter cream.  loved the cream but the shortbread didn't do it for me.  i really don't like shortbread cookie as i find them to be dry. while i still need to try their pies, i can say that, dessert wise, its pretty good and worth a tryFirst time having Australian pie like a few Yelpers here.  The small $6 butter chicken patty was a crispy, layered, and creamy package, very enjoyable.  Mild flavors and not too salty, the way i like it.  There are a few Tabasco and srirachas to choose from, but I chose to have mine plain. Was ok.  Not worth going out of way for. came to try something i never tasted before; the Australian food.  Juicy and voluminous pies, lot of choices even vegetarian, special rare desserts, great deal in frozen product.  First impression was "tiny", but last impression was "wao I'm really satisfied".  its definitely worth to try in your lunch-snack time. The appearance of this tiny restaurant does not match the big taste of  the food they serve at all. . . the pie I tried was amazingly delicious, the crust was so buttery and flaky and the veggies filling just perfect.  They have a variety of unusual but delicious desserts, I tried the yoyo and it was heavenly. . . . will be back again to try more pies and sweets. We had sausages, butter chicken and chilli corn carne.  One better than the other one.  We'll be back!!I'd heard about this place for years but never ventured there for one reason or another.  I can't believe I've been missing out on this TASTY TASTY place lo these past 5 years (they recently celebrated their anniversary!). Definitely a niche market but mon dieu it was lovely to sink into a crispy, warm steak and mushroom pie.  Heard good things about the curried veg which I'll try next time but really, I'd like to try every single one.  They have fresh and frozen varieties and single serving pies from $5. 00-6. 50 or giant family pies for averaging $15.  With a salad or soup on the side it would have been a filling, comforting meal.  On it's own a nice, hearty snack!They also have a great selection of sweets including this cake that I was told was Hugh Jackman's favorite when he was in town shooting Wolverine.  A very light sponge cake (not too sweet) called a "LAMINGTON" with a bit of jam and dipped in chocolate/coconut.  It might sound odd but it was SOOOO GOOD.  They also stock 3 different varieties of TimTam cookies (trouble!) and some sweets that I'd never seen before.  The sticky toffee pudding with bourbon whipped cream also looked tempting but better on a cold, winter's night. . . A few minutes from Parc Jean Mance this place is one of a kind.  Special pies based on Aussie and Kiwi staples that you won't find anywhere else in Montreal.  They gave a very large selection including vegetarian options and they're all equally delicious.  Besides the great pies they also have excellent sweets that you also can't find elsewhere.  Perfect for take out or else they have a small terrace on Parc. Visited Ta on Wednesday afternoon to grab some comfort food for my girlfriend who is still recovering from surgery.   She wanted to try a meat pie.   Now I know these aren't Canadian style meat pies, but Wolverine said they were legit, and who am I to argue with the most BA X-Man ever?  If I lived in Montreal I would probably eat here every day, I would also probably be obese.   Selection of hot pies was a little limited as it was later in the day, but I was able to pick up two steak and cheese pies, one for me to eat there and one to take back to my girlfriend.   All I can say is, how do we not have these in the states?  The crust was light and flaky and basically melted in my mouth.   For a $6 meal I expected the steak to be tough and not flavorful, I couldn't have been more wrong.   The meat was tender and juicy and the gravy and cheese inside were in perfect proportions.   I complimented my meal with some mushy peas, which I think were good, but as a Yank, have really no idea what they're supposed to taste like.   I grabbed two ANZAC biscuits (they are NOT cookies!) and a lemon/lime and bitters (which was quite refreshing on an 80 something degree afternoon) and hit the road back to the convalescence home.   My lady was equally impressed, though to be fair, she has been eating hospital food for two weeks.   Anyways, this small spot is a must do for a lunch or a quick snack for anyone living or visiting Montreal.   The space is tiny but the service and quality of the food more than made up.   Cheers!Oooooooh. .  I'm a 29yo Australian who hasn't lived there since he was 8, but have visited.  So I have a childhood attraction to that Australian taste. I walked in here today after work, next to the park, and was thrilled to see they not only had pies, but Australian products! Vegemite, Cherry Ripe, etc.  They also have Lemingtons etc.  Which was amazing to find because I usually get people to bring this stuff to me in their suitcases! :)Anyway, my wife and I ordered two pies to eat there, not to go.  Mine steak/cheese, and hers a vegetarian.  And they were lovely.  The pastry was super yummy just like good Aussie pies, and filling was good too.  Not exactly the same (not better/worse, just different) but still really nice. I'll definitely stop here every now and then for a casual pie to go as I walk through the park down to Sherbrooke. (Note: Australian pies etc aren't "cuisine" in Australia, they're just a common fast food, like poutine.  And it's not so much the pie that is the dish, but more the Australian way of eating it ie: on the go, with a handheld container etc, or at a football game.  Either way, there's a special rich taste in them that these guys get right.  :))Delicious.  My daughters love the sausage rolls, I'm partial to the Ned Kelly, though I've tried other flavors and really liked them.  My husband finds them too rich, but he's not writing the review so I'll not remove a star for that. First time I had australian pies so I have no idea how its supposed to taste like.  What I can say is the puff pastry was excellent.  But as most British-decent foods, it was bland and greasy.  I didnt have the butter chicken pie though, which is apparently one of the best. Think small; tiny space, small counters and tables with a few chairs.  It's very casual in a depanneur kinda way. So my first suggestion is. . . maybe go for take out. Now let's talk PIE.  I had a buy 1 get 1 free pie coupon which made my meal more even more affordable.  If you want in on this deal without the coupon, follow ta-pies on Facebook or Twitter and they'll let you know when this promotion is happening! I bought the curried sweet potato pie, and my friend had the butter chicken pie.  It cost us about $6 (including the coupon), which meant I paid only $3. . . score! At first I thought I might need two pies to fill me up, but when the guy at the counter handed my pie over to me, I was happy to see it was a 'good size'.  I'm sorry if I can't really give you the exact circumference, but hey, it was the perfect amount to fill my stomach.  I wish my pie was liiiitttle warmer.  It wasn't a fantastic pie, but it was tasty.  And who can complain for the price?Ta-pies also sells Australian goods at a high mark-up.  I didn't get to try any of the desserts, but the coconut and chocolate dipped sponge cake looked a bit sad (and questionable) sitting in the large glass cookie jar on the counter.  Anyone have any thoughts about the date pudding or the doughnut? I hope to try those at some point!Very helpful service at the desk and the pies are excellent!  The standard meat (beef) and butter chicken (yes!!) were de-lish.   They even have lamb!  It was a hit with the hubby and the kids.   With a picture of Aussie Hugh Jackman (the Wolverine of X Men) displayed prominently on the wall, what's not to like?Only four stars for the limited seating. Hungry for Australian cuisine? Then you better make your way here!It's a small little shop near the park.  A friend did research where to eat and find this place! Ta Pies is great for all things pies and desserts! They sell Australian products like Tim Tam (the best!), Vegemite, Milo, etc.  They also have Tim Tam Homemade ice cream which is divine! Best thing ever created.  So, friends and I were there to take out and bring back to our hotel.  The lovely lady at the counter said a whole pie would take 35 minutes to be ready, which was fine with us.  She was very nice and explain to us what each pie was and what tim tams were and how to eat them (even though I already knew).  After 10 minutes of deciding, or what felt like 10 minutes, we got a spinach and cheese pie.  The place is quite small, you can eat inside or outside on the patio.  We went to the park that was a block away instead of waiting inside the shop.  I think she was waiting for us cause the pie was under the heat lamp.  She gave us a bag, plates, and forks.  Onto the actual food tasting, the crust looked so crumbly with buttery goodness! It was great.  It was definitely a different type of dough crust that I'm used to.  It wasn't flaky, but it a couple layers.  I really liked it.  Lots of filling to go with it too.  Very filling. Overall :If you eat nothing else on your visit to Montreal, you must try Ta Pies.   Seriously - go out of your way, this place is a gem. Food :My partner had the buttered chicken (sort of a curry chicken flavor) and I had the beef and cheese.   Hers was delicious and really flavorful, mine was excellent.   The crust was buttery and flaky, and the filling was well seasoned with the cheese as an accent rather than an overwhelming element.   My partner lived in Australia for a while and confirmed, these were pretty perfect and totally authentic.   I have never put anything in my mouth that made me this happy. Everything Else :Not much else to say - seating is sparse and mostly outdoors.   Service is counter-style ordering.   Decor. . .  no real impression.   I don't take any stars off for this because Ta Pies is exactly what it seems like - a side of the road pie stand for you to grab a handheld bite and go.   Perfect!I write all my reviews based on a student budget:Went with a friend and we got two pies for about $14, the veggie one was superb, the beef with cheese was okay.  Certainly didn't fill us up so it felt more like an appetizer. I'm not Australian or a New Zealander which is probably why I don't feel as connected or committed to this store as the others. I do like that they sell Milo (love that stuff) and Vegemite (yes I eat it, and I am not from Down Under). . .  but the pies were OK.  They were well made, and rich and good, but I had a vegan wrap earlier that day and it was much better than the pie (I am drooling to get another  vegan wrap again). .  which only tells me that the pie was just OK. I do love me a good puff pastry pie though, but I can make better at home with some President's Choice puff pastry pie and stuff it with chicken thigh meat, veggies and cream. .  mmmmmI was actually really looking forward to eating the chicken and mushroom pie but that's a special pie apparently, made once a month.  BOO!I would have tried the traditional minced meat pie but I don't eat ground beef any more (*cough*becauseooftheammoniawashingfecesawayfromth­emeat*cough*). Very limited seating, reasonably priced at $6.  I'd come back and eat if I was in the area and hungry, but I won't make a special trip out there to eat this once a week. The pies are amazingly good! I've been there with a friend for lunch: even the side dishes are good.  Great deals!"Quite possibly the best pie I've had in my life!", said my friend after eating here (OK it was actually my internal monologue, but my friend did agree that the pie was delicious ;D). I'll admit, I'm new to the concept of pies as a meal, I've always associated pies with dessert.   Ta Pies make delectable meal-pies (I don't know if that's a thing but I'm going to run with it) in many varieties, for omnivores and vegetarians alike.   I really enjoyed the spinach, mushroom, tomato, and Ricotta cheese pie, as well as the curried vegetable pie.   I ordered some meat pies for some friends from work, the steak and mushroom, and the steak, bacon, and mushroom, and they raved about them.   Even I was tempted, based on the pies I had.

Besides the great pies they also have excellent sweets that you also can't find elsewhere.  Perfect for take out or else they have a small terrace on Parc. Visited Ta on Wednesday afternoon to grab some comfort food for my girlfriend who is still recovering from surgery.   She wanted to try a meat pie.   Now I know these aren't Canadian style meat pies, but Wolverine said they were legit, and who am I to argue with the most BA X-Man ever?  If I lived in Montreal I would probably eat here every day, I would also probably be obese.   Selection of hot pies was a little limited as it was later in the day, but I was able to pick up two steak and cheese pies, one for me to eat there and one to take back to my girlfriend.   All I can say is, how do we not have these in the states?  The crust was light and flaky and basically melted in my mouth.   For a $6 meal I expected the steak to be tough and not flavorful, I couldn't have been more wrong.   The meat was tender and juicy and the gravy and cheese inside were in perfect proportions.   I complimented my meal with some mushy peas, which I think were good, but as a Yank, have really no idea what they're supposed to taste like.   I grabbed two ANZAC biscuits (they are NOT cookies!) and a lemon/lime and bitters (which was quite refreshing on an 80 something degree afternoon) and hit the road back to the convalescence home.   My lady was equally impressed, though to be fair, she has been eating hospital food for two weeks.   Anyways, this small spot is a must do for a lunch or a quick snack for anyone living or visiting Montreal.   The space is tiny but the service and quality of the food more than made up.   Cheers!Oooooooh. .  I'm a 29yo Australian who hasn't lived there since he was 8, but have visited.  So I have a childhood attraction to that Australian taste. I walked in here today after work, next to the park, and was thrilled to see they not only had pies, but Australian products! Vegemite, Cherry Ripe, etc.  They also have Lemingtons etc.  Which was amazing to find because I usually get people to bring this stuff to me in their suitcases! :)Anyway, my wife and I ordered two pies to eat there, not to go.  Mine steak/cheese, and hers a vegetarian.  And they were lovely.  The pastry was super yummy just like good Aussie pies, and filling was good too.  Not exactly the same (not better/worse, just different) but still really nice. I'll definitely stop here every now and then for a casual pie to go as I walk through the park down to Sherbrooke. (Note: Australian pies etc aren't "cuisine" in Australia, they're just a common fast food, like poutine.  And it's not so much the pie that is the dish, but more the Australian way of eating it ie: on the go, with a handheld container etc, or at a football game.  Either way, there's a special rich taste in them that these guys get right.  :))Delicious.  My daughters love the sausage rolls, I'm partial to the Ned Kelly, though I've tried other flavors and really liked them.  My husband finds them too rich, but he's not writing the review so I'll not remove a star for that. First time I had australian pies so I have no idea how its supposed to taste like.  What I can say is the puff pastry was excellent.  But as most British-decent foods, it was bland and greasy.  I didnt have the butter chicken pie though, which is apparently one of the best. Think small; tiny space, small counters and tables with a few chairs.  It's very casual in a depanneur kinda way. So my first suggestion is. . . maybe go for take out. Now let's talk PIE.  I had a buy 1 get 1 free pie coupon which made my meal more even more affordable.  If you want in on this deal without the coupon, follow ta-pies on Facebook or Twitter and they'll let you know when this promotion is happening! I bought the curried sweet potato pie, and my friend had the butter chicken pie.  It cost us about $6 (including the coupon), which meant I paid only $3. . . score! At first I thought I might need two pies to fill me up, but when the guy at the counter handed my pie over to me, I was happy to see it was a 'good size'.  I'm sorry if I can't really give you the exact circumference, but hey, it was the perfect amount to fill my stomach.  I wish my pie was liiiitttle warmer.  It wasn't a fantastic pie, but it was tasty.  And who can complain for the price?Ta-pies also sells Australian goods at a high mark-up.  I didn't get to try any of the desserts, but the coconut and chocolate dipped sponge cake looked a bit sad (and questionable) sitting in the large glass cookie jar on the counter.  Anyone have any thoughts about the date pudding or the doughnut? I hope to try those at some point!Very helpful service at the desk and the pies are excellent!  The standard meat (beef) and butter chicken (yes!!) were de-lish.   They even have lamb!  It was a hit with the hubby and the kids.   With a picture of Aussie Hugh Jackman (the Wolverine of X Men) displayed prominently on the wall, what's not to like?Only four stars for the limited seating. Hungry for Australian cuisine? Then you better make your way here!It's a small little shop near the park.  A friend did research where to eat and find this place! Ta Pies is great for all things pies and desserts! They sell Australian products like Tim Tam (the best!), Vegemite, Milo, etc.  They also have Tim Tam Homemade ice cream which is divine! Best thing ever created.  So, friends and I were there to take out and bring back to our hotel.  The lovely lady at the counter said a whole pie would take 35 minutes to be ready, which was fine with us.  She was very nice and explain to us what each pie was and what tim tams were and how to eat them (even though I already knew).  After 10 minutes of deciding, or what felt like 10 minutes, we got a spinach and cheese pie.  The place is quite small, you can eat inside or outside on the patio.  We went to the park that was a block away instead of waiting inside the shop.  I think she was waiting for us cause the pie was under the heat lamp.  She gave us a bag, plates, and forks.  Onto the actual food tasting, the crust looked so crumbly with buttery goodness! It was great.  It was definitely a different type of dough crust that I'm used to.  It wasn't flaky, but it a couple layers.  I really liked it.  Lots of filling to go with it too.  Very filling. Overall :If you eat nothing else on your visit to Montreal, you must try Ta Pies.   Seriously - go out of your way, this place is a gem. Food :My partner had the buttered chicken (sort of a curry chicken flavor) and I had the beef and cheese.   Hers was delicious and really flavorful, mine was excellent.   The crust was buttery and flaky, and the filling was well seasoned with the cheese as an accent rather than an overwhelming element.   My partner lived in Australia for a while and confirmed, these were pretty perfect and totally authentic.   I have never put anything in my mouth that made me this happy. Everything Else :Not much else to say - seating is sparse and mostly outdoors.   Service is counter-style ordering.   Decor. . .  no real impression.   I don't take any stars off for this because Ta Pies is exactly what it seems like - a side of the road pie stand for you to grab a handheld bite and go.   Perfect!I write all my reviews based on a student budget:Went with a friend and we got two pies for about $14, the veggie one was superb, the beef with cheese was okay.  Certainly didn't fill us up so it felt more like an appetizer. I'm not Australian or a New Zealander which is probably why I don't feel as connected or committed to this store as the others. I do like that they sell Milo (love that stuff) and Vegemite (yes I eat it, and I am not from Down Under). . .  but the pies were OK.  They were well made, and rich and good, but I had a vegan wrap earlier that day and it was much better than the pie (I am drooling to get another  vegan wrap again). .  which only tells me that the pie was just OK. I do love me a good puff pastry pie though, but I can make better at home with some President's Choice puff pastry pie and stuff it with chicken thigh meat, veggies and cream. .  mmmmmI was actually really looking forward to eating the chicken and mushroom pie but that's a special pie apparently, made once a month.  BOO!I would have tried the traditional minced meat pie but I don't eat ground beef any more (*cough*becauseooftheammoniawashingfecesawayfromth­emeat*cough*). Very limited seating, reasonably priced at $6.  I'd come back and eat if I was in the area and hungry, but I won't make a special trip out there to eat this once a week. The pies are amazingly good! I've been there with a friend for lunch: even the side dishes are good.  Great deals!
