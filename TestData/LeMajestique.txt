On a recent 10 day Montreal extravaganza, we hit the restaurant scene pretty hard.  It's all a blur, but the times I have reflected on the trip (like right now months later back in Texas on a Monday afternoon. . . ), my thoughts keep coming back to Le Majestique.  I think it was the ONLY restaurant that was completely unplanned.  We walked down from Mount Royal through McGill and up Saint-Laurent, enjoying the walk (hike??) back to our hotel.  Peering into Le Majestique, we decided to stop for a drink and ended up having the greatest siesta of the whole trip. I suppose quaint is the word to use.  There's some really, really odd decor going on, but the service and atmosphere were very warm.  After having a cocktail, we decided to stay a bit longer and ordered some delicious fries + dipping mayo.  And then more drinks! There were plenty of other menu items that sounded great and looked amazing when nearby patrons had them delivered to their tables.  If I ever make it back to Montreal, I'll definitely stop by here again if not only to try more of the menu but simply to enjoy the ambiance.  It was a nice reminder that the best times in life are unplanned and without direction.  When you sit down for food and drink without any other thoughts and watch life go on through the window, that's what it means to relax. Moving away from the Main as I have recently have led me to think about all the great restaurants up and down the Main that I have enjoyed over my 9 years a short walk away. . .  The only disappointment to my new location is I now have to bike or drive to them all! Despite my best attempts, there were also a few spots that I never got to in my time so close by. .  luckily a beautiful Sunday evening recently allowed me to cross another one off the list, Majestique. Located in an old Lester's deli, owned by the Holder brothers and with the menu designed by the former Chef-de-Cuisine at Toque, Charles-Antoine Crète, Majestique recently has an interesting pedigree within the Montreal restaurant scene.  The vibe is very casual but the menu and cocktails speak to a certain level of refinement.  Looking at the menu, it's an interesting mix of dishes but one that really doesn't fit any true designation.  Given the beautiful day, we requested a table on their small terrasse but as there would be a slight wait, we started our evening inside in a room that is probably best described as hipster deli/chalet.  The old deli is still clearly visible but just covered in an insane amount of knickknacks ranging from sports pinnies to bowling pins and coke bottles.  The look is not from everyone but I really enjoyed it. As we waited for our table outside, I went with the SPF 45 cocktail - White Barbancourt rum, lime juice, kaffir lime syrup and dashfire chinese bitters.  A surprisingly mild cocktail where the lime really comes through.  A solid summer terrasse drink. Very shortly after, we sat down on the terrasse and ordered some oysters to start because my girlfriend had never had some raw before and because why not? Served with a classic mignonette and a very interesting apple cider mignonette, these oysters were beautiful and fresh.  As always, more could have been ordered but with the rest of the food ordered, we held off to save some room. The first of our entrees came up next.  First was the tostada topped with sushi rice, avocado and nori.  What a lovely dish! The tostada in this case was using rice paper which had a light and fluffy texture.  The combination of creamy avocado, sticky rice, the nori and a spicy mayo worked very nicely on top. The next dish was whelk served with herb butter and fried bread, so sea snails served like traditional snails but with a twist.  The herb butter was a great discovery on my end - didn't overpower the natural fattiness of the whelk like traditional garlic butter but still brought a subtle adjustment to the flavour.  The whelk has delicious and the fried bread added a bit of crunch to the combination. Then came the squid salad with cherry tomatoes, pancetta and fava beans.  Such beautiful squid - so rich and tender.  Paired simply with the fresh veggies and herbs, the squid is so good that frankly it could have been the only thing on the plate and I would still love the dish!A dish that definitely surprised was the burnt salmon confit served with an apple and almond salad.  I really didn't know what to expect from salmon confit and the answer was a ridiculously soft texture.  It may perhaps be seen as too soft, almost mushy to some people but we really dug it.  The salad was very non-descript and honestly just felt like filler on the plate. We couldn't say no to a side-order of fries and those came through nicely as well.  Good sized with a nice crunch and already salted, they paired very well with our final main dish - the foot-long Nordic shrimp roll.  Best dish all night and it's not that close despite the positives I stated of the previous plates.  Great flavourful shrimp filling in an insane toasted brioche-like hot dog bun.  Best hot dog bum I've ever had without a shadow of a doubt.  Knowing what this ended up being, I would have skipped one of the previous dishes to order another just for myself.  So so good. . . For dessert, we had two options available to us - sucre à la creme and cheesecake with rhubarb.  The sucre à la creme was small in portion but oh so good.  Dangerous little sugar packages.  The cheesecake was nice and creamy with a nice rhubarb jelly over top.  Solid sweet options to end our meal. Majestique was quite a nice meal from beginning to end.  Solid cocktails, great technique and execution throughout the meal.  The overall menu left me somewhat baffled in terms of how one describes this place.  Regardless, the quality of the food and the fact that the kitchen is open late nights makes this a great option for a late bite along the Main.  Majestic is just another sign that the heart of the Main food wise continues to work its way northward and now I have another reason to re-visit my old neighbourhood. Cheers!You know, this was probably our favorite find that we didn't plan on finding, which is typically the best kind.  We'd been stumbling around, walking aimlessly, and enjoying this part of town for hours.  We'd already made our way up and then back down Mount Royal, walked across campus, and found ourselves in need of sustenance.  Not just a simple swig of water and a protein bar kind of sustenance, okay, I yearned for a real and cozy connection to the city in some way.  A place to enter and feel welcomed with positivity, comfort, no rushing, and quality products.  I needed a long break of casual leisure! What I'm trying to say is, I needed good food and drink in a cool spot. Le Majestique was perfection.  The waiters and bartenders were so calm and cool.  Even the random dude sitting in there working on his laptop while he drank an entire bottle of wine was the coolest.  I just wanted to immediately be friends with all of these people and lounge over the craft cocktail menu, which had some beautiful, classic choices.  A great wine list and even McKeown Cider, which I'd been looking for.  Ciders aren't easy to come by in Montreal, but this biz felt like a very "me" place (and I betcha they give off that same familiar feeling to most of their patrons, which is why they're so great).  You just kind of find parts of yourself in the restaurant.  In the decor, in the menu, in the vibe.  Somewhere.  We ordered the fries of course, which were unapologetically, classic, big, fat, hot, greasy fries.  Not bad greasy though, the good kind.  Then we ordered the salmon dish. .  A perfectly portioned beautiful filet that'd been smoked halfway through and then caramelized on top.  Oh my god, the flavors and textures were brilliant.  Best piece of fish I ate in all of Montreal.  And they can easily accommodate for the gluten free without hesitation, an attitude, or lack in quality. We didn't stay in here for long, just sort of popped in for a sunset rest before we headed out to prepare for dinner.  But when in Montreal again, I know now to seek out Le Majestique and take better advantage of its killer space, unique menu, and stellar drink options.  Plus, brunch?! It's just the greatest restaurant, you have to get in there, relax, and see what you can find. Delicious food! The grilled octopus was our favorite dish.  The plates are small so we ordered a bunch and shared them all.  We were impressed with the quality.  The atmosphere was energetic and quirky, and the restaurant was very busy. My partner and I ate at Le Majestique while we were visiting Montreal, and overall, we are glad we read the food blogs to find out about this place because it was a great meal at the bar. It must've been a slow weekend, because we are able to snag a reservation for the day-of.  We opted to sit at the bar, which was the best idea - we enjoy interacting with the bartender and you can really learn about a place and the food that way. First off, the cocktails are very good.  You can tell that the bartenders really care about their creations, and their old fashioned was one of the best I ever had.  They use cheesecloth to skim the contents, so the drink is very light. The food is also a particular stand out.  We opted for the Asian slaw, which, although it was a good portion, we almost want to order a second one because it was so good.  They're also known for their hot dog, which ultimately my partner liked more than I did.  Those were the two stand-outs. Overall, we had a great meal at Le Majestique, and I would definitely recommend it to people who are visiting.  Very intimate and romantic vibe, though the restaurant turns into a busy bar/club scene eventually. Been there few times already.  Good place to go with friends.  They have a beautiful cocktail list and a few good wines.  Some of the highlights are the oysters, the huge dog dog and the burgots/snails.  They're opened late at night and it's usually busy all week long.  I love the look of the place, they managed to keep the spirit of the old fast food that was there before and incorporate some key elements that makes the style unique, like the maple sirup cans used for the ustensiles :)What a gem and a true reflection on evolution of the Montreal food scene.  It feels a bit like a New York style restaurant, but of-course, with the French flair. In terms of a menu, Chef Marcio is doing great things here - his concept is break all rules.  From their fresh oysters with interesting accompaniments, to the 12" hotdog, you're on a roller coaster ride of a menu of things you shouldn't be putting together, but you do, and together it sings.  For me personally, it allowed me to break some traditional rules in a fun and imaginative manner. From a service perspective, it's professional yet casual.  From a price point perspective, it's high value for what you're getting.  And from an Ambience perspective, it's the crazy mind of a fun artist.  and i must make mention to the most tender octopus and perfectly cooked pork belly i've had globally.  Well done!I'm a fan! We had planned on going somewhere else and while the plan failed, we were surprisingly happy to find Le Majestique.  It was a little hot in the back, but we were happy to have found a good restaurant close by (or so what people said on the street).  So, all of my girlfriends loved their meals.  The meals are on the small side, so expect to eat two to be full.  I got the fries and  quinoa salad: expect full flavours in all the dishes.  Even fries were f*ing delicious! LOL Anyway, I was able to try some of my friends' food and enjoyed theirs very much.  The service was great, their wine was good, overall: no complaints, this was a great place for a girls' night.  Giving it a 4/5 because they could have more vegan options.  Otherwise, 5/5 for the flavours!I came for breakfast a few weeks ago with a couple girlfriends and we all enjoyed our meals very much.  I had the salmon feuilleté and it was light, lovely and tasty, covered with a mount of frisée.  The bloody caesar was tasty but a bit pricy.  I will come back for oysters very soon.  Lovely atmosphere and cute decor. I love the look and feel of this small warm friendly sexy restaurant on St Laurent and Rachel.  The staff was funny and welcoming and helpful and made me want to come back often for oysters and cocktails at the bar.  The lighting and design is romantic without being fancy, eclectic and history rich without trying too hard.  Lots to look at and talk about. The food we tried - especially the raw salmon salad, bean salad and oysters - was delicate and smart and very yummy.  I came in starving and did feel like the menu lacked options for food that suited the room: warm, filling, cool, unpretentious.  Lots of small plates at fairly high prices when I was there but I think they change it up often, and anyway the clean bright tastes and the completely perfect cocktail made for me based on a description of how I was feeling by a handsome happy gent who didn't miss a beat all night will bring me back again for sure. Had great great cocktails here on a sunday night while it was freezing freeeezing outside.   My boyfriend and i tried two very different very delicious cocktails and got a small dessert to share. The service was lovely and they played really great music. Great atmosphere and great lighting.  Overall this was our favorite bar we found during our first visit to Montreal. I've been all over the world and this place has some of the absolute best food I've ever tasted.  I highly recommend the Quinoa Croquette and the Bacon de Gaspor Braisé.  The decor is super stylish and cool.  Every single waiter is ridiculously attractive.  Dylan, who is actually the son of the owner was great.  We were having some trouble reading the menu and he happily walked us through all of the items that they offer.  He even chatted with us a bit about Montrèal.  My point is GO HERE.  You will not regret it. This cozy bar/restaurant was just what we were looking for after a long day walking around the city.  Great selection of drinks and good food.  The best part is the service.  Super attentive and the bartender even gave us some recommendations for local breweries that were worth checking outGreat Cocktails.  Friendly Staff. A great little unpretentious "grown up" bar in the heart of the Plateau.  All the bartenders seem really adept at actual mixology, and they're really friendly and social.  I'd even recommend sitting at the bar and getting to know them so that they can get to know your taste in cocktails. There's also a nice snack menu that includes fresh oysters because, well, it's supposed to be an oyster bar, so if you're into aphrodisiacs from the deep, you'll wanna check that out, too. We stumbled on this restaurant while walking this amazing street.  From the moment we walked in the staff was very attentive.  They gave us great food and drinks recommendations.  The cocktails were well mixed and very creative.  We started with a  crab special and oysters.  They both tasted fresh and had great sauces to dip in.  Every thing from the drinks to the dessert were prepared perfectly and was just enough for us to share.  This was by far our best meal while we were visiting Montreal.  If we are back in the future, I will definitely come here again!Amazing service, amazing food, amazing beer, did I mention that everything was just great? Keep in mind that on Friday their kitchen opens at 5pm while bar opens at 4pm.  Every single dish was amazing.  The wheat beer we tried was tasty and refreshing.  We had squid, snails, salmon and my personal favourite - pork belly! Every dish we had I would order again! Amazing.  Will defined be back. Great spot.  Super friendly staff.  Classy European atmosphere.  And they make great cocktails.  Definitely try the oysters here!I absolutely loved the setup and overall atmosphere.  Although I wasn't too impressed by the food - which felt a little overpriced and tasted just OK, this is definitely a great place for drinks and oysters for a festive evening. Really enjoyed Le Majestique.  The food was really good (even though I am not the biggest fan of tapas) and the drinks were delicious. I really like the atmosphere here, and the staff are amazing.  Will definitely go back again. The service was poor.   We were a party of two from out of town who needed a hand with the menu but was not given assistance.   Another party of two got the full service and breakdown of the menu in English while we were left clueless.   The service was amateur hour.   In terms of the food, we had the blonde beer which was very good.   The oysters we ordered were ok but we found pieces of shell in the oysters.    I guess this is a bar and this review could be over  harsh.   Consistency in service is all I ask.   Treat your guests the same way like how you should treat people in general. On a recent 10 day Montreal extravaganza, we hit the restaurant scene pretty hard.
