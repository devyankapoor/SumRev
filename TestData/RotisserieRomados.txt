My second time eating here and this time I tried their poutine, the chicken and the poutine were delicious! My friends fell in love with this place and it was their first time eating poutine and they screamed out more poutine on our way back to New Haven! Craving for more delicious chicken & poutine from this place!!!Be aware they do not take credit card. Cash or Debit only!If you're visiting Montreal like the wife and I and trying to find this place, just walk down Rue Rachel and let that wonderful sweet smoke guide your senses.  That delicious smell wafting through the air will lead you to some tasty Portuguese comfort food. Plain and simply . . . Just order the chicken plate!  You can order it with a 1/4, 1/2 or full chicken. It comes with a crispy on the outside, tender on the inside rotisserie chicken slathered with a spicy, citrusy Portuguese barbecue sauce that'll make you say, "Thank Goodness we came here after that 2 hour hike through Parc du Mt Royal!"  A salad, rice and some of the best seasoned fries I've tasted is literally piled high on your plate.  I'm glad the wife and I shared a plate because I had just enough room for that Portuguese egg tart and coconut flan.  The egg tart was flaky, chewy and creamy all at the same time.  And if you like flan, just imagine flan with a little coconut rum like twist . . . Miam!Excellent food . . . Happy wallet!Well, nothing's perfect. On the one hand, the food here is consistently delicious and cheap; the kind of feel-good food you treat yourself to on a weekend or a busy weeknight. You've seen the reviews.On the other hand, ordering from here is a huge pain. Ordering in advance serves no real purpose (I've ended up waiting longer than the walk-ins every time) and the line system is confusing and poorly laid out. For instance, there's a reason every fast food place ever has you order and pay at the start : it avoids the type of checkout bottleneck that is at this point a staple of Romados. Another annoyance is the two side-by-side order lines with no divider; a solution that would be much more elegant and effective than 3 different signs above and below customers' line of sight (cue arguments with other patrons). And another: no credit card and no paywave payments make payment unnecessarily slow every time. I could go on.But when all is said and done, the chicken is so good that I still end up braving the crowds and coming here nearly once a week. Problem is, Romados' management knows it, too.Worth the hype; Ramados offers authentic Portuguese style rotisserie chicken with addictive sauces and good service. The chicken is butterflied and chopped into finger food sized pieces. The skin is very crispy and beautifully seasoned. Order ahead to avoid lines. However,  we showed up to a lineup that stretched to the door and did not have to wait long as the staff bagged chicken after chicken with surprising speed. If you're hungry; get the whole chicken for two. Fries are also delicious from here. The salad is nothing to rave about but then again this place is not about eating salad. Staff is friendly and efficient.Often imitated rarely (but many places are trying) duplicated. Romados is the benchmark for Portuguese chicken and fries in Montreal. It's been a while since I've eaten here and can't believe I haven't reviewed it but here we go. Came here with out of town friends on a Friday night to explain this joint is a staple in Montreal dining. We arrived at near 8PM and the line was almost out the door. I explained to my friends the wait was well worth it. 20 minutes later we were eating delicious tender succulent charcoal grilled chicken. The flavour is really out of this world. The mix of the spicy sauce and grilled flavour is 7th heaven. The fries are light and heaping in serving. Also provided was a small salad. My friends had to try the chicken poutine and it came as a massive serving with a heap of chopped chicken. Words that come to my mind about Romados: sublime, delicious, light, flavourful, spice, seasoned, fall off the bone tender, huge portions, tasty awesome and inexpensive! If you don't eat here you are missing out on one of Montreal's finest dining experiences!Arriving at a good time, the lineup behind me got massive!   We only had 4-5 parties in front of us, and the line moved quickly.The chicken is divine.   It is cooked on a rotisserie with a dry rub, and you can add a spicy sauce to it - which wasn't spicy at all, but very tasty.  They toss the chicken bits into a bag, and off you go.   There is minimal seating inside so plan to eat elsewhere - there is a nearby park with picnic tables we found.   Service is quick, and this place is popular for a reason - great chicken.One of my absolute pet peeves is going to a restaurant and being served dry chicken. Fortunately, this is not the case!This used to be one of my favorite places to grab lunch in Montreal. The chicken is very juicy and tender. It is seasoned perfectly with tons of flavor from each bite. Everything is fairly priced and the portions they give are reasonable. Definitely a great place, unfortunately it is a bit far and inconvenient to go.Very satisfied and highly recommended!Hot restaurant served hot food but cold tart.... It seemed to be lined up all the time because the price was very reasonable for such large portion of chicken. I had 1/4 chicken with half rice and half fries(Thank the friendly staff for meeting my requirements :) . But honestly, I expected to taste much flavourful chicken not just salty. Even all the side dishes, salad, rice and fries are better than chicken. The bread was good but the tart was not crisp at all!! The cold stuffing was too sweet. So, I only can give it 3 stars.So I have nothing to say against the food. The chicken is always super tasty and well cooked. My chicken sandwich was excellent and my salad was good. The only thing is I wish they put a bit more love in their service. I mean the lady literally throw a huge handful of salad in my styrofoam box, add way too much dressing and force the cover to close. So I'm walking with salad hanging out my box and dressing dripping all over...not the end of the world but I like love served with my food. That's all.Love the chicken and desserts. Fries as well! But always busy the place so recommend to go.First and only time i've had portuguese chicken and I was not dissapointed. The chicken was very flavourful and juicy. You get a huge box of fries and chicken for about 10$. Would visit every time i'm in the neighborhood.Forget all the other chicken places when in Montreal.  Romados hands down has the best chicken in the city.When you come to Romados, you will notice that they have classic Portuguese fair on the menu, bifanas, fish, etc, but I can't stress it enough, ORDER THE CHICKEN.  You won't be disappointed.  It comes with seasoned fries and a little salad.  When the person at the counter asks if you want sauce, say yes! Sauce on the chicken but also tell him or her to put on the fried.  Trust me.As you sit down and open the box, just be careful.  The fries might be overflowing.When you will bite into the perfectly cooked chicken, you won't be able to help but notice how crispy the skin is and how juicy and smokey the meat is.  It literally falls off the bone! Just make sure you lick those bones clean, I sure know I do!I don't live in Montreal anymore, but when I do come back, I make sure I make a pit stop at Romados.  Every time my friends tell me they're going to Montreal, I tell them they have to go to Romados.  They come back thanking me and telling me that it was the best chicken they have had in their lives!  YES, I'm serious!Once you're done, if you still have space left, get one of their pasteis de nata (Portuguese custard tarts).  Simply delicious.  By far the best place for Portuguese chicken, or any chicken for that matter, in Montreal.  There's a reason that there's always a line up.Super moist chicken, and great desserts! Protip - dont take pics of their chicken behind in the kitchen i was yelled at in french by a very angry lady. We ordered half a chicken and sides to share with some friends. The spicy sauce was really tasty but not quite spicy so hot food friends might be disappointed. I'd come here as a regular for sure if I lived nearby!This was the best meal I had in Montreal. I ate at Joe Beef, and all the top restaurants in old town and Rotissire Romados kicked them all to the curb. 1/2 chicken with spicy sauce, fresh fries, and salad... all for under $10? You seriously can't beat that. The chicken juices and hot sauce seep into the fries if you let it sit for a few minutes. Take yours to-go, walk down to La Fontaine Park and enjoy the best chicken while sitting on the grass. I wish we had a restaurant like this in San Francisco!used to live in MTL and this was a staple of the city... A fire closed their doors for a while and they took the opportunity to give it a facelift. Chicken is second to none. Order for pickup to avoid crazy lineups mid day.This is yet another establishment which makes Montreal Montreal. Nothing fancy, no gimmicks, no attitude and amazing prices. Just roasted Portuguese chicken, fries, sauce, salad and a bread and Portuguese and French pastry counter.There is absolutely nothing more that I can add except to say that if you are visiting Montreal or a naive Montrealer who has never gone then GO. Like NOW.Chicken roasted to perfection, juicy and yet still practically falling off the bone. So good that you're going to use your hand to get right into the bone as well.And then the fries. These are perfect salt and pepper fries, which reminded me of the salt and pepper chips which the Kettle brand makes. Try to get them slathered with the spicy sauce and it's a joygasm in your mouth. They also sell homemade Portuguese sausages, buns and of course natas, their sweet egg custard cups which are probably the best in the city.For $13 bucks for a whole chicken, it's worth your while to pick up a bird or two, a large order of fries and take them home, keep them in glass containers to keep them fresh, and you have a great lunch meal to take to work for a couple of days.While you're waiting in line, it's an interesting place to people watch. Everybody seems to come here, I saw Portuguese aunties, guys from the hip hop crowd, snotty Westmount chicks waiting in the Land Rovers outside, professionals coming from work and everyone in between. That's the thing about great food; it brings everyone together.Went there yesterday hoping to get a tasty meal on an empty stomach. Sunday night around 6pm. I waited in line 20 mins, and a third of the line had passed. I still had 2/3rds in front of me, so I left, I couldn't wait another 40. I wish I could speak for the chicken, but it looks like not. Looks like they need to rethink operations.//Vibe|Wait\\Although in a hipster area, this place isn't hipster at all. Has that classic neighborhood bakery look/feel. There are two lines, if you're only ordering bread/pastries/stuff from the freezer, get on the bakery side. Chicken is the left side.Rotisserie doesn't start until 11 am. So if you show up early and there's no line, that's because only the bakery is open. Once lunch time rolls around, no matter what day of the week, there is a wait. We queued up at 11:30 and even though the line wasn't out the door, we still waited maybe more than 30 mins. So if you live in the area, call ahead. Limited seating, but when we went, not many people were sitting to eat, so you might find an open table during lunch time so long as your group is small.//Food\\Very reasonable prices, generous portions of fries (short, thick cut). For the popularity and wait time, I just didn't get the hype behind the chicken. Maybe I should've gotten the spicy seasoning, because beside a strong taste of wine, the chicken didn't taste that special to me. It's not bad, but not a taste I'd wait so long in line for. The seasoning on the fries are good, but a little too sweet for me. You get a lot of fries for what you order, so think twice before placing a separate order or even going for the medium or large fries.I really liked the egg tarts.The crust itself was thick, chewy, layered, and flavorful. A good pastry base, which isn't always present in most egg tarts. Although the custard was much too sweet for me (with a smooth and non-curdled consistency), I was pretty impressed by the crust, and my kids thought these were the best they'd ever had.Chicken made with crack.THE FOODI have never had rotisserie that was so compelling, this is something else. The chorizo is excellent too. The fries are not bad either, and they also have a pretty amazing bakery section.THE SERVICEPretty friendly and efficient.THE ATMOSPHEREBusy, hip, bustling.Good price value. Everything on the menu is pretty good, but they are competing with a lot of good Portuguese places in the area. The service could be a bit more friendly.My second time eating here and this time I tried their poutine, the chicken and the poutine were delicious!

I ate at Joe Beef, and all the top restaurants in old town and Rotissire Romados kicked them all to the curb. 1/2 chicken with spicy sauce, fresh fries, and salad... all for under $10? You seriously can't beat that. The chicken juices and hot sauce seep into the fries if you let it sit for a few minutes. Take yours to-go, walk down to La Fontaine Park and enjoy the best chicken while sitting on the grass. I wish we had a restaurant like this in San Francisco!used to live in MTL and this was a staple of the city... A fire closed their doors for a while and they took the opportunity to give it a facelift. Chicken is second to none. Order for pickup to avoid crazy lineups mid day.This is yet another establishment which makes Montreal Montreal. Nothing fancy, no gimmicks, no attitude and amazing prices. Just roasted Portuguese chicken, fries, sauce, salad and a bread and Portuguese and French pastry counter.There is absolutely nothing more that I can add except to say that if you are visiting Montreal or a naive Montrealer who has never gone then GO. Like NOW.Chicken roasted to perfection, juicy and yet still practically falling off the bone. So good that you're going to use your hand to get right into the bone as well.And then the fries. These are perfect salt and pepper fries, which reminded me of the salt and pepper chips which the Kettle brand makes. Try to get them slathered with the spicy sauce and it's a joygasm in your mouth. They also sell homemade Portuguese sausages, buns and of course natas, their sweet egg custard cups which are probably the best in the city.For $13 bucks for a whole chicken, it's worth your while to pick up a bird or two, a large order of fries and take them home, keep them in glass containers to keep them fresh, and you have a great lunch meal to take to work for a couple of days.While you're waiting in line, it's an interesting place to people watch. Everybody seems to come here, I saw Portuguese aunties, guys from the hip hop crowd, snotty Westmount chicks waiting in the Land Rovers outside, professionals coming from work and everyone in between. That's the thing about great food; it brings everyone together.Went there yesterday hoping to get a tasty meal on an empty stomach. Sunday night around 6pm. I waited in line 20 mins, and a third of the line had passed. I still had 2/3rds in front of me, so I left, I couldn't wait another 40. I wish I could speak for the chicken, but it looks like not. Looks like they need to rethink operations.//Vibe|Wait\\Although in a hipster area, this place isn't hipster at all. Has that classic neighborhood bakery look/feel. There are two lines, if you're only ordering bread/pastries/stuff from the freezer, get on the bakery side. Chicken is the left side.Rotisserie doesn't start until 11 am. So if you show up early and there's no line, that's because only the bakery is open. Once lunch time rolls around, no matter what day of the week, there is a wait. We queued up at 11:30 and even though the line wasn't out the door, we still waited maybe more than 30 mins. So if you live in the area, call ahead. Limited seating, but when we went, not many people were sitting to eat, so you might find an open table during lunch time so long as your group is small.//Food\\Very reasonable prices, generous portions of fries (short, thick cut). For the popularity and wait time, I just didn't get the hype behind the chicken. Maybe I should've gotten the spicy seasoning, because beside a strong taste of wine, the chicken didn't taste that special to me. It's not bad, but not a taste I'd wait so long in line for. The seasoning on the fries are good, but a little too sweet for me. You get a lot of fries for what you order, so think twice before placing a separate order or even going for the medium or large fries.I really liked the egg tarts.The crust itself was thick, chewy, layered, and flavorful. A good pastry base, which isn't always present in most egg tarts. Although the custard was much too sweet for me (with a smooth and non-curdled consistency), I was pretty impressed by the crust, and my kids thought these were the best they'd ever had.Chicken made with crack.THE FOODI have never had rotisserie that was so compelling, this is something else. The chorizo is excellent too. The fries are not bad either, and they also have a pretty amazing bakery section.THE SERVICEPretty friendly and efficient.THE ATMOSPHEREBusy, hip, bustling.Good price value. Everything on the menu is pretty good, but they are competing with a lot of good Portuguese places in the area. The service could be a bit more friendly.My second time eating here and this time I tried their poutine, the chicken and the poutine were delicious! My friends fell in love with this place and it was their first time eating poutine and they screamed out more poutine on our way back to New Haven! Craving for more delicious chicken & poutine from this place!!!Be aware they do not take credit card. Cash or Debit only!If you're visiting Montreal like the wife and I and trying to find this place, just walk down Rue Rachel and let that wonderful sweet smoke guide your senses.  That delicious smell wafting through the air will lead you to some tasty Portuguese comfort food. Plain and simply . . . Just order the chicken plate!  You can order it with a 1/4, 1/2 or full chicken. It comes with a crispy on the outside, tender on the inside rotisserie chicken slathered with a spicy, citrusy Portuguese barbecue sauce that'll make you say, "Thank Goodness we came here after that 2 hour hike through Parc du Mt Royal!"  A salad, rice and some of the best seasoned fries I've tasted is literally piled high on your plate.  I'm glad the wife and I shared a plate because I had just enough room for that Portuguese egg tart and coconut flan.  The egg tart was flaky, chewy and creamy all at the same time.  And if you like flan, just imagine flan with a little coconut rum like twist . . . Miam!Excellent food . . . Happy wallet!Well, nothing's perfect. On the one hand, the food here is consistently delicious and cheap; the kind of feel-good food you treat yourself to on a weekend or a busy weeknight. You've seen the reviews.On the other hand, ordering from here is a huge pain. Ordering in advance serves no real purpose (I've ended up waiting longer than the walk-ins every time) and the line system is confusing and poorly laid out. For instance, there's a reason every fast food place ever has you order and pay at the start : it avoids the type of checkout bottleneck that is at this point a staple of Romados. Another annoyance is the two side-by-side order lines with no divider; a solution that would be much more elegant and effective than 3 different signs above and below customers' line of sight (cue arguments with other patrons). And another: no credit card and no paywave payments make payment unnecessarily slow every time. I could go on.But when all is said and done, the chicken is so good that I still end up braving the crowds and coming here nearly once a week. Problem is, Romados' management knows it, too.Worth the hype; Ramados offers authentic Portuguese style rotisserie chicken with addictive sauces and good service. The chicken is butterflied and chopped into finger food sized pieces. The skin is very crispy and beautifully seasoned. Order ahead to avoid lines. However,  we showed up to a lineup that stretched to the door and did not have to wait long as the staff bagged chicken after chicken with surprising speed. If you're hungry; get the whole chicken for two. Fries are also delicious from here. The salad is nothing to rave about but then again this place is not about eating salad. Staff is friendly and efficient.Often imitated rarely (but many places are trying) duplicated. Romados is the benchmark for Portuguese chicken and fries in Montreal. It's been a while since I've eaten here and can't believe I haven't reviewed it but here we go. Came here with out of town friends on a Friday night to explain this joint is a staple in Montreal dining. We arrived at near 8PM and the line was almost out the door. I explained to my friends the wait was well worth it. 20 minutes later we were eating delicious tender succulent charcoal grilled chicken. The flavour is really out of this world. The mix of the spicy sauce and grilled flavour is 7th heaven. The fries are light and heaping in serving. Also provided was a small salad. My friends had to try the chicken poutine and it came as a massive serving with a heap of chopped chicken. Words that come to my mind about Romados: sublime, delicious, light, flavourful, spice, seasoned, fall off the bone tender, huge portions, tasty awesome and inexpensive! If you don't eat here you are missing out on one of Montreal's finest dining experiences!Arriving at a good time, the lineup behind me got massive!   We only had 4-5 parties in front of us, and the line moved quickly.The chicken is divine.   It is cooked on a rotisserie with a dry rub, and you can add a spicy sauce to it - which wasn't spicy at all, but very tasty.  They toss the chicken bits into a bag, and off you go.   There is minimal seating inside so plan to eat elsewhere - there is a nearby park with picnic tables we found.   Service is quick, and this place is popular for a reason - great chicken.One of my absolute pet peeves is going to a restaurant and being served dry chicken. Fortunately, this is not the case!This used to be one of my favorite places to grab lunch in Montreal. The chicken is very juicy and tender. It is seasoned perfectly with tons of flavor from each bite. Everything is fairly priced and the portions they give are reasonable. Definitely a great place, unfortunately it is a bit far and inconvenient to go.Very satisfied and highly recommended!Hot restaurant served hot food but cold tart.... It seemed to be lined up all the time because the price was very reasonable for such large portion of chicken. I had 1/4 chicken with half rice and half fries(Thank the friendly staff for meeting my requirements :) . But honestly, I expected to taste much flavourful chicken not just salty. Even all the side dishes, salad, rice and fries are better than chicken. The bread was good but the tart was not crisp at all!! The cold stuffing was too sweet. So, I only can give it 3 stars.So I have nothing to say against the food. The chicken is always super tasty and well cooked. My chicken sandwich was excellent and my salad was good. The only thing is I wish they put a bit more love in their service. I mean the lady literally throw a huge handful of salad in my styrofoam box, add way too much dressing and force the cover to close. So I'm walking with salad hanging out my box and dressing dripping all over...not the end of the world but I like love served with my food. That's all.Love the chicken and desserts. Fries as well! But always busy the place so recommend to go.First and only time i've had portuguese chicken and I was not dissapointed. The chicken was very flavourful and juicy. You get a huge box of fries and chicken for about 10$. Would visit every time i'm in the neighborhood.Forget all the other chicken places when in Montreal.  Romados hands down has the best chicken in the city.When you come to Romados, you will notice that they have classic Portuguese fair on the menu, bifanas, fish, etc, but I can't stress it enough, ORDER THE CHICKEN.  You won't be disappointed.  It comes with seasoned fries and a little salad.  When the person at the counter asks if you want sauce, say yes! Sauce on the chicken but also tell him or her to put on the fried.  Trust me.As you sit down and open the box, just be careful.  The fries might be overflowing.When you will bite into the perfectly cooked chicken, you won't be able to help but notice how crispy the skin is and how juicy and smokey the meat is.  It literally falls off the bone! Just make sure you lick those bones clean, I sure know I do!I don't live in Montreal anymore, but when I do come back, I make sure I make a pit stop at Romados.  Every time my friends tell me they're going to Montreal, I tell them they have to go to Romados.  They come back thanking me and telling me that it was the best chicken they have had in their lives!  YES, I'm serious!Once you're done, if you still have space left, get one of their pasteis de nata (Portuguese custard tarts).  Simply delicious.  By far the best place for Portuguese chicken, or any chicken for that matter, in Montreal.  There's a reason that there's always a line up.Super moist chicken, and great desserts! Protip - dont take pics of their chicken behind in the kitchen i was yelled at in french by a very angry lady. We ordered half a chicken and sides to share with some friends.

It's been a while since I've eaten here and can't believe I haven't reviewed it but here we go. Came here with out of town friends on a Friday night to explain this joint is a staple in Montreal dining. We arrived at near 8PM and the line was almost out the door. I explained to my friends the wait was well worth it. 20 minutes later we were eating delicious tender succulent charcoal grilled chicken. The flavour is really out of this world. The mix of the spicy sauce and grilled flavour is 7th heaven. The fries are light and heaping in serving. Also provided was a small salad. My friends had to try the chicken poutine and it came as a massive serving with a heap of chopped chicken. Words that come to my mind about Romados: sublime, delicious, light, flavourful, spice, seasoned, fall off the bone tender, huge portions, tasty awesome and inexpensive! If you don't eat here you are missing out on one of Montreal's finest dining experiences!Arriving at a good time, the lineup behind me got massive!   We only had 4-5 parties in front of us, and the line moved quickly.The chicken is divine.   It is cooked on a rotisserie with a dry rub, and you can add a spicy sauce to it - which wasn't spicy at all, but very tasty.  They toss the chicken bits into a bag, and off you go.   There is minimal seating inside so plan to eat elsewhere - there is a nearby park with picnic tables we found.   Service is quick, and this place is popular for a reason - great chicken.One of my absolute pet peeves is going to a restaurant and being served dry chicken. Fortunately, this is not the case!This used to be one of my favorite places to grab lunch in Montreal. The chicken is very juicy and tender. It is seasoned perfectly with tons of flavor from each bite. Everything is fairly priced and the portions they give are reasonable. Definitely a great place, unfortunately it is a bit far and inconvenient to go.Very satisfied and highly recommended!Hot restaurant served hot food but cold tart.... It seemed to be lined up all the time because the price was very reasonable for such large portion of chicken. I had 1/4 chicken with half rice and half fries(Thank the friendly staff for meeting my requirements :) . But honestly, I expected to taste much flavourful chicken not just salty. Even all the side dishes, salad, rice and fries are better than chicken. The bread was good but the tart was not crisp at all!! The cold stuffing was too sweet. So, I only can give it 3 stars.So I have nothing to say against the food. The chicken is always super tasty and well cooked. My chicken sandwich was excellent and my salad was good. The only thing is I wish they put a bit more love in their service. I mean the lady literally throw a huge handful of salad in my styrofoam box, add way too much dressing and force the cover to close. So I'm walking with salad hanging out my box and dressing dripping all over...not the end of the world but I like love served with my food. That's all.Love the chicken and desserts. Fries as well! But always busy the place so recommend to go.First and only time i've had portuguese chicken and I was not dissapointed. The chicken was very flavourful and juicy. You get a huge box of fries and chicken for about 10$. Would visit every time i'm in the neighborhood.Forget all the other chicken places when in Montreal.  Romados hands down has the best chicken in the city.When you come to Romados, you will notice that they have classic Portuguese fair on the menu, bifanas, fish, etc, but I can't stress it enough, ORDER THE CHICKEN.  You won't be disappointed.  It comes with seasoned fries and a little salad.  When the person at the counter asks if you want sauce, say yes! Sauce on the chicken but also tell him or her to put on the fried.  Trust me.As you sit down and open the box, just be careful.  The fries might be overflowing.When you will bite into the perfectly cooked chicken, you won't be able to help but notice how crispy the skin is and how juicy and smokey the meat is.  It literally falls off the bone! Just make sure you lick those bones clean, I sure know I do!I don't live in Montreal anymore, but when I do come back, I make sure I make a pit stop at Romados.  Every time my friends tell me they're going to Montreal, I tell them they have to go to Romados.  They come back thanking me and telling me that it was the best chicken they have had in their lives!  YES, I'm serious!Once you're done, if you still have space left, get one of their pasteis de nata (Portuguese custard tarts).  Simply delicious.  By far the best place for Portuguese chicken, or any chicken for that matter, in Montreal.  There's a reason that there's always a line up.Super moist chicken, and great desserts! Protip - dont take pics of their chicken behind in the kitchen i was yelled at in french by a very angry lady. We ordered half a chicken and sides to share with some friends. The spicy sauce was really tasty but not quite spicy so hot food friends might be disappointed. I'd come here as a regular for sure if I lived nearby!This was the best meal I had in Montreal. I ate at Joe Beef, and all the top restaurants in old town and Rotissire Romados kicked them all to the curb. 1/2 chicken with spicy sauce, fresh fries, and salad... all for under $10? You seriously can't beat that. The chicken juices and hot sauce seep into the fries if you let it sit for a few minutes. Take yours to-go, walk down to La Fontaine Park and enjoy the best chicken while sitting on the grass. I wish we had a restaurant like this in San Francisco!used to live in MTL and this was a staple of the city... A fire closed their doors for a while and they took the opportunity to give it a facelift. Chicken is second to none. Order for pickup to avoid crazy lineups mid day.This is yet another establishment which makes Montreal Montreal. Nothing fancy, no gimmicks, no attitude and amazing prices. Just roasted Portuguese chicken, fries, sauce, salad and a bread and Portuguese and French pastry counter.There is absolutely nothing more that I can add except to say that if you are visiting Montreal or a naive Montrealer who has never gone then GO. Like NOW.Chicken roasted to perfection, juicy and yet still practically falling off the bone. So good that you're going to use your hand to get right into the bone as well.And then the fries. These are perfect salt and pepper fries, which reminded me of the salt and pepper chips which the Kettle brand makes. Try to get them slathered with the spicy sauce and it's a joygasm in your mouth. They also sell homemade Portuguese sausages, buns and of course natas, their sweet egg custard cups which are probably the best in the city.For $13 bucks for a whole chicken, it's worth your while to pick up a bird or two, a large order of fries and take them home, keep them in glass containers to keep them fresh, and you have a great lunch meal to take to work for a couple of days.While you're waiting in line, it's an interesting place to people watch. Everybody seems to come here, I saw Portuguese aunties, guys from the hip hop crowd, snotty Westmount chicks waiting in the Land Rovers outside, professionals coming from work and everyone in between. That's the thing about great food; it brings everyone together.Went there yesterday hoping to get a tasty meal on an empty stomach. Sunday night around 6pm. I waited in line 20 mins, and a third of the line had passed. I still had 2/3rds in front of me, so I left, I couldn't wait another 40. I wish I could speak for the chicken, but it looks like not. Looks like they need to rethink operations.//Vibe|Wait\\Although in a hipster area, this place isn't hipster at all. Has that classic neighborhood bakery look/feel. There are two lines, if you're only ordering bread/pastries/stuff from the freezer, get on the bakery side. Chicken is the left side.Rotisserie doesn't start until 11 am. So if you show up early and there's no line, that's because only the bakery is open. Once lunch time rolls around, no matter what day of the week, there is a wait. We queued up at 11:30 and even though the line wasn't out the door, we still waited maybe more than 30 mins. So if you live in the area, call ahead. Limited seating, but when we went, not many people were sitting to eat, so you might find an open table during lunch time so long as your group is small.//Food\\Very reasonable prices, generous portions of fries (short, thick cut). For the popularity and wait time, I just didn't get the hype behind the chicken. Maybe I should've gotten the spicy seasoning, because beside a strong taste of wine, the chicken didn't taste that special to me. It's not bad, but not a taste I'd wait so long in line for. The seasoning on the fries are good, but a little too sweet for me. You get a lot of fries for what you order, so think twice before placing a separate order or even going for the medium or large fries.I really liked the egg tarts.The crust itself was thick, chewy, layered, and flavorful. A good pastry base, which isn't always present in most egg tarts. Although the custard was much too sweet for me (with a smooth and non-curdled consistency), I was pretty impressed by the crust, and my kids thought these were the best they'd ever had.Chicken made with crack.THE FOODI have never had rotisserie that was so compelling, this is something else. The chorizo is excellent too. The fries are not bad either, and they also have a pretty amazing bakery section.THE SERVICEPretty friendly and efficient.THE ATMOSPHEREBusy, hip, bustling.Good price value. Everything on the menu is pretty good, but they are competing with a lot of good Portuguese places in the area. The service could be a bit more friendly.My second time eating here and this time I tried their poutine, the chicken and the poutine were delicious! My friends fell in love with this place and it was their first time eating poutine and they screamed out more poutine on our way back to New Haven! Craving for more delicious chicken & poutine from this place!!!Be aware they do not take credit card. Cash or Debit only!If you're visiting Montreal like the wife and I and trying to find this place, just walk down Rue Rachel and let that wonderful sweet smoke guide your senses.  That delicious smell wafting through the air will lead you to some tasty Portuguese comfort food. Plain and simply . . . Just order the chicken plate!  You can order it with a 1/4, 1/2 or full chicken. It comes with a crispy on the outside, tender on the inside rotisserie chicken slathered with a spicy, citrusy Portuguese barbecue sauce that'll make you say, "Thank Goodness we came here after that 2 hour hike through Parc du Mt Royal!"  A salad, rice and some of the best seasoned fries I've tasted is literally piled high on your plate.  I'm glad the wife and I shared a plate because I had just enough room for that Portuguese egg tart and coconut flan.  The egg tart was flaky, chewy and creamy all at the same time.  And if you like flan, just imagine flan with a little coconut rum like twist . . . Miam!Excellent food . . . Happy wallet!Well, nothing's perfect. On the one hand, the food here is consistently delicious and cheap; the kind of feel-good food you treat yourself to on a weekend or a busy weeknight. You've seen the reviews.On the other hand, ordering from here is a huge pain. Ordering in advance serves no real purpose (I've ended up waiting longer than the walk-ins every time) and the line system is confusing and poorly laid out. For instance, there's a reason every fast food place ever has you order and pay at the start : it avoids the type of checkout bottleneck that is at this point a staple of Romados. Another annoyance is the two side-by-side order lines with no divider; a solution that would be much more elegant and effective than 3 different signs above and below customers' line of sight (cue arguments with other patrons). And another: no credit card and no paywave payments make payment unnecessarily slow every time. I could go on.But when all is said and done, the chicken is so good that I still end up braving the crowds and coming here nearly once a week. Problem is, Romados' management knows it, too.Worth the hype; Ramados offers authentic Portuguese style rotisserie chicken with addictive sauces and good service. The chicken is butterflied and chopped into finger food sized pieces. The skin is very crispy and beautifully seasoned. Order ahead to avoid lines. However,  we showed up to a lineup that stretched to the door and did not have to wait long as the staff bagged chicken after chicken with surprising speed. If you're hungry; get the whole chicken for two. Fries are also delicious from here. The salad is nothing to rave about but then again this place is not about eating salad.

So if you show up early and there's no line, that's because only the bakery is open. Once lunch time rolls around, no matter what day of the week, there is a wait. We queued up at 11:30 and even though the line wasn't out the door, we still waited maybe more than 30 mins. So if you live in the area, call ahead. Limited seating, but when we went, not many people were sitting to eat, so you might find an open table during lunch time so long as your group is small.//Food\\Very reasonable prices, generous portions of fries (short, thick cut). For the popularity and wait time, I just didn't get the hype behind the chicken. Maybe I should've gotten the spicy seasoning, because beside a strong taste of wine, the chicken didn't taste that special to me. It's not bad, but not a taste I'd wait so long in line for. The seasoning on the fries are good, but a little too sweet for me. You get a lot of fries for what you order, so think twice before placing a separate order or even going for the medium or large fries.I really liked the egg tarts.The crust itself was thick, chewy, layered, and flavorful. A good pastry base, which isn't always present in most egg tarts. Although the custard was much too sweet for me (with a smooth and non-curdled consistency), I was pretty impressed by the crust, and my kids thought these were the best they'd ever had.Chicken made with crack.THE FOODI have never had rotisserie that was so compelling, this is something else. The chorizo is excellent too. The fries are not bad either, and they also have a pretty amazing bakery section.THE SERVICEPretty friendly and efficient.THE ATMOSPHEREBusy, hip, bustling.Good price value. Everything on the menu is pretty good, but they are competing with a lot of good Portuguese places in the area. The service could be a bit more friendly.My second time eating here and this time I tried their poutine, the chicken and the poutine were delicious! My friends fell in love with this place and it was their first time eating poutine and they screamed out more poutine on our way back to New Haven! Craving for more delicious chicken & poutine from this place!!!Be aware they do not take credit card. Cash or Debit only!If you're visiting Montreal like the wife and I and trying to find this place, just walk down Rue Rachel and let that wonderful sweet smoke guide your senses.  That delicious smell wafting through the air will lead you to some tasty Portuguese comfort food. Plain and simply . . . Just order the chicken plate!  You can order it with a 1/4, 1/2 or full chicken. It comes with a crispy on the outside, tender on the inside rotisserie chicken slathered with a spicy, citrusy Portuguese barbecue sauce that'll make you say, "Thank Goodness we came here after that 2 hour hike through Parc du Mt Royal!"  A salad, rice and some of the best seasoned fries I've tasted is literally piled high on your plate.  I'm glad the wife and I shared a plate because I had just enough room for that Portuguese egg tart and coconut flan.  The egg tart was flaky, chewy and creamy all at the same time.  And if you like flan, just imagine flan with a little coconut rum like twist . . . Miam!Excellent food . . . Happy wallet!Well, nothing's perfect. On the one hand, the food here is consistently delicious and cheap; the kind of feel-good food you treat yourself to on a weekend or a busy weeknight. You've seen the reviews.On the other hand, ordering from here is a huge pain. Ordering in advance serves no real purpose (I've ended up waiting longer than the walk-ins every time) and the line system is confusing and poorly laid out. For instance, there's a reason every fast food place ever has you order and pay at the start : it avoids the type of checkout bottleneck that is at this point a staple of Romados. Another annoyance is the two side-by-side order lines with no divider; a solution that would be much more elegant and effective than 3 different signs above and below customers' line of sight (cue arguments with other patrons). And another: no credit card and no paywave payments make payment unnecessarily slow every time. I could go on.But when all is said and done, the chicken is so good that I still end up braving the crowds and coming here nearly once a week. Problem is, Romados' management knows it, too.Worth the hype; Ramados offers authentic Portuguese style rotisserie chicken with addictive sauces and good service. The chicken is butterflied and chopped into finger food sized pieces. The skin is very crispy and beautifully seasoned. Order ahead to avoid lines. However,  we showed up to a lineup that stretched to the door and did not have to wait long as the staff bagged chicken after chicken with surprising speed. If you're hungry; get the whole chicken for two. Fries are also delicious from here. The salad is nothing to rave about but then again this place is not about eating salad. Staff is friendly and efficient.Often imitated rarely (but many places are trying) duplicated. Romados is the benchmark for Portuguese chicken and fries in Montreal. It's been a while since I've eaten here and can't believe I haven't reviewed it but here we go. Came here with out of town friends on a Friday night to explain this joint is a staple in Montreal dining. We arrived at near 8PM and the line was almost out the door. I explained to my friends the wait was well worth it. 20 minutes later we were eating delicious tender succulent charcoal grilled chicken. The flavour is really out of this world. The mix of the spicy sauce and grilled flavour is 7th heaven. The fries are light and heaping in serving. Also provided was a small salad. My friends had to try the chicken poutine and it came as a massive serving with a heap of chopped chicken. Words that come to my mind about Romados: sublime, delicious, light, flavourful, spice, seasoned, fall off the bone tender, huge portions, tasty awesome and inexpensive! If you don't eat here you are missing out on one of Montreal's finest dining experiences!Arriving at a good time, the lineup behind me got massive!   We only had 4-5 parties in front of us, and the line moved quickly.The chicken is divine.   It is cooked on a rotisserie with a dry rub, and you can add a spicy sauce to it - which wasn't spicy at all, but very tasty.  They toss the chicken bits into a bag, and off you go.   There is minimal seating inside so plan to eat elsewhere - there is a nearby park with picnic tables we found.   Service is quick, and this place is popular for a reason - great chicken.One of my absolute pet peeves is going to a restaurant and being served dry chicken. Fortunately, this is not the case!This used to be one of my favorite places to grab lunch in Montreal. The chicken is very juicy and tender. It is seasoned perfectly with tons of flavor from each bite. Everything is fairly priced and the portions they give are reasonable. Definitely a great place, unfortunately it is a bit far and inconvenient to go.Very satisfied and highly recommended!Hot restaurant served hot food but cold tart.... It seemed to be lined up all the time because the price was very reasonable for such large portion of chicken. I had 1/4 chicken with half rice and half fries(Thank the friendly staff for meeting my requirements :) . But honestly, I expected to taste much flavourful chicken not just salty. Even all the side dishes, salad, rice and fries are better than chicken. The bread was good but the tart was not crisp at all!! The cold stuffing was too sweet. So, I only can give it 3 stars.So I have nothing to say against the food. The chicken is always super tasty and well cooked. My chicken sandwich was excellent and my salad was good. The only thing is I wish they put a bit more love in their service. I mean the lady literally throw a huge handful of salad in my styrofoam box, add way too much dressing and force the cover to close. So I'm walking with salad hanging out my box and dressing dripping all over...not the end of the world but I like love served with my food. That's all.Love the chicken and desserts. Fries as well! But always busy the place so recommend to go.First and only time i've had portuguese chicken and I was not dissapointed. The chicken was very flavourful and juicy. You get a huge box of fries and chicken for about 10$. Would visit every time i'm in the neighborhood.Forget all the other chicken places when in Montreal.  Romados hands down has the best chicken in the city.When you come to Romados, you will notice that they have classic Portuguese fair on the menu, bifanas, fish, etc, but I can't stress it enough, ORDER THE CHICKEN.  You won't be disappointed.  It comes with seasoned fries and a little salad.  When the person at the counter asks if you want sauce, say yes! Sauce on the chicken but also tell him or her to put on the fried.  Trust me.As you sit down and open the box, just be careful.  The fries might be overflowing.When you will bite into the perfectly cooked chicken, you won't be able to help but notice how crispy the skin is and how juicy and smokey the meat is.  It literally falls off the bone! Just make sure you lick those bones clean, I sure know I do!I don't live in Montreal anymore, but when I do come back, I make sure I make a pit stop at Romados.  Every time my friends tell me they're going to Montreal, I tell them they have to go to Romados.  They come back thanking me and telling me that it was the best chicken they have had in their lives!  YES, I'm serious!Once you're done, if you still have space left, get one of their pasteis de nata (Portuguese custard tarts).  Simply delicious.  By far the best place for Portuguese chicken, or any chicken for that matter, in Montreal.  There's a reason that there's always a line up.Super moist chicken, and great desserts! Protip - dont take pics of their chicken behind in the kitchen i was yelled at in french by a very angry lady. We ordered half a chicken and sides to share with some friends. The spicy sauce was really tasty but not quite spicy so hot food friends might be disappointed. I'd come here as a regular for sure if I lived nearby!This was the best meal I had in Montreal. I ate at Joe Beef, and all the top restaurants in old town and Rotissire Romados kicked them all to the curb. 1/2 chicken with spicy sauce, fresh fries, and salad... all for under $10? You seriously can't beat that. The chicken juices and hot sauce seep into the fries if you let it sit for a few minutes. Take yours to-go, walk down to La Fontaine Park and enjoy the best chicken while sitting on the grass. I wish we had a restaurant like this in San Francisco!used to live in MTL and this was a staple of the city... A fire closed their doors for a while and they took the opportunity to give it a facelift. Chicken is second to none. Order for pickup to avoid crazy lineups mid day.This is yet another establishment which makes Montreal Montreal. Nothing fancy, no gimmicks, no attitude and amazing prices. Just roasted Portuguese chicken, fries, sauce, salad and a bread and Portuguese and French pastry counter.There is absolutely nothing more that I can add except to say that if you are visiting Montreal or a naive Montrealer who has never gone then GO. Like NOW.Chicken roasted to perfection, juicy and yet still practically falling off the bone. So good that you're going to use your hand to get right into the bone as well.And then the fries. These are perfect salt and pepper fries, which reminded me of the salt and pepper chips which the Kettle brand makes. Try to get them slathered with the spicy sauce and it's a joygasm in your mouth. They also sell homemade Portuguese sausages, buns and of course natas, their sweet egg custard cups which are probably the best in the city.For $13 bucks for a whole chicken, it's worth your while to pick up a bird or two, a large order of fries and take them home, keep them in glass containers to keep them fresh, and you have a great lunch meal to take to work for a couple of days.While you're waiting in line, it's an interesting place to people watch. Everybody seems to come here, I saw Portuguese aunties, guys from the hip hop crowd, snotty Westmount chicks waiting in the Land Rovers outside, professionals coming from work and everyone in between. That's the thing about great food; it brings everyone together.Went there yesterday hoping to get a tasty meal on an empty stomach. Sunday night around 6pm. I waited in line 20 mins, and a third of the line had passed. I still had 2/3rds in front of me, so I left, I couldn't wait another 40. I wish I could speak for the chicken, but it looks like not.

So I'm walking with salad hanging out my box and dressing dripping all over...not the end of the world but I like love served with my food. That's all.Love the chicken and desserts. Fries as well! But always busy the place so recommend to go.First and only time i've had portuguese chicken and I was not dissapointed. The chicken was very flavourful and juicy. You get a huge box of fries and chicken for about 10$. Would visit every time i'm in the neighborhood.Forget all the other chicken places when in Montreal.  Romados hands down has the best chicken in the city.When you come to Romados, you will notice that they have classic Portuguese fair on the menu, bifanas, fish, etc, but I can't stress it enough, ORDER THE CHICKEN.  You won't be disappointed.  It comes with seasoned fries and a little salad.  When the person at the counter asks if you want sauce, say yes! Sauce on the chicken but also tell him or her to put on the fried.  Trust me.As you sit down and open the box, just be careful.  The fries might be overflowing.When you will bite into the perfectly cooked chicken, you won't be able to help but notice how crispy the skin is and how juicy and smokey the meat is.  It literally falls off the bone! Just make sure you lick those bones clean, I sure know I do!I don't live in Montreal anymore, but when I do come back, I make sure I make a pit stop at Romados.  Every time my friends tell me they're going to Montreal, I tell them they have to go to Romados.  They come back thanking me and telling me that it was the best chicken they have had in their lives!  YES, I'm serious!Once you're done, if you still have space left, get one of their pasteis de nata (Portuguese custard tarts).  Simply delicious.  By far the best place for Portuguese chicken, or any chicken for that matter, in Montreal.  There's a reason that there's always a line up.Super moist chicken, and great desserts! Protip - dont take pics of their chicken behind in the kitchen i was yelled at in french by a very angry lady. We ordered half a chicken and sides to share with some friends. The spicy sauce was really tasty but not quite spicy so hot food friends might be disappointed. I'd come here as a regular for sure if I lived nearby!This was the best meal I had in Montreal. I ate at Joe Beef, and all the top restaurants in old town and Rotissire Romados kicked them all to the curb. 1/2 chicken with spicy sauce, fresh fries, and salad... all for under $10? You seriously can't beat that. The chicken juices and hot sauce seep into the fries if you let it sit for a few minutes. Take yours to-go, walk down to La Fontaine Park and enjoy the best chicken while sitting on the grass. I wish we had a restaurant like this in San Francisco!used to live in MTL and this was a staple of the city... A fire closed their doors for a while and they took the opportunity to give it a facelift. Chicken is second to none. Order for pickup to avoid crazy lineups mid day.This is yet another establishment which makes Montreal Montreal. Nothing fancy, no gimmicks, no attitude and amazing prices. Just roasted Portuguese chicken, fries, sauce, salad and a bread and Portuguese and French pastry counter.There is absolutely nothing more that I can add except to say that if you are visiting Montreal or a naive Montrealer who has never gone then GO. Like NOW.Chicken roasted to perfection, juicy and yet still practically falling off the bone. So good that you're going to use your hand to get right into the bone as well.And then the fries. These are perfect salt and pepper fries, which reminded me of the salt and pepper chips which the Kettle brand makes. Try to get them slathered with the spicy sauce and it's a joygasm in your mouth. They also sell homemade Portuguese sausages, buns and of course natas, their sweet egg custard cups which are probably the best in the city.For $13 bucks for a whole chicken, it's worth your while to pick up a bird or two, a large order of fries and take them home, keep them in glass containers to keep them fresh, and you have a great lunch meal to take to work for a couple of days.While you're waiting in line, it's an interesting place to people watch. Everybody seems to come here, I saw Portuguese aunties, guys from the hip hop crowd, snotty Westmount chicks waiting in the Land Rovers outside, professionals coming from work and everyone in between. That's the thing about great food; it brings everyone together.Went there yesterday hoping to get a tasty meal on an empty stomach. Sunday night around 6pm. I waited in line 20 mins, and a third of the line had passed. I still had 2/3rds in front of me, so I left, I couldn't wait another 40. I wish I could speak for the chicken, but it looks like not. Looks like they need to rethink operations.//Vibe|Wait\\Although in a hipster area, this place isn't hipster at all. Has that classic neighborhood bakery look/feel. There are two lines, if you're only ordering bread/pastries/stuff from the freezer, get on the bakery side. Chicken is the left side.Rotisserie doesn't start until 11 am. So if you show up early and there's no line, that's because only the bakery is open. Once lunch time rolls around, no matter what day of the week, there is a wait. We queued up at 11:30 and even though the line wasn't out the door, we still waited maybe more than 30 mins. So if you live in the area, call ahead. Limited seating, but when we went, not many people were sitting to eat, so you might find an open table during lunch time so long as your group is small.//Food\\Very reasonable prices, generous portions of fries (short, thick cut). For the popularity and wait time, I just didn't get the hype behind the chicken. Maybe I should've gotten the spicy seasoning, because beside a strong taste of wine, the chicken didn't taste that special to me. It's not bad, but not a taste I'd wait so long in line for. The seasoning on the fries are good, but a little too sweet for me. You get a lot of fries for what you order, so think twice before placing a separate order or even going for the medium or large fries.I really liked the egg tarts.The crust itself was thick, chewy, layered, and flavorful. A good pastry base, which isn't always present in most egg tarts. Although the custard was much too sweet for me (with a smooth and non-curdled consistency), I was pretty impressed by the crust, and my kids thought these were the best they'd ever had.Chicken made with crack.THE FOODI have never had rotisserie that was so compelling, this is something else. The chorizo is excellent too. The fries are not bad either, and they also have a pretty amazing bakery section.THE SERVICEPretty friendly and efficient.THE ATMOSPHEREBusy, hip, bustling.Good price value. Everything on the menu is pretty good, but they are competing with a lot of good Portuguese places in the area. The service could be a bit more friendly.My second time eating here and this time I tried their poutine, the chicken and the poutine were delicious! My friends fell in love with this place and it was their first time eating poutine and they screamed out more poutine on our way back to New Haven! Craving for more delicious chicken & poutine from this place!!!Be aware they do not take credit card. Cash or Debit only!If you're visiting Montreal like the wife and I and trying to find this place, just walk down Rue Rachel and let that wonderful sweet smoke guide your senses.  That delicious smell wafting through the air will lead you to some tasty Portuguese comfort food. Plain and simply . . . Just order the chicken plate!  You can order it with a 1/4, 1/2 or full chicken. It comes with a crispy on the outside, tender on the inside rotisserie chicken slathered with a spicy, citrusy Portuguese barbecue sauce that'll make you say, "Thank Goodness we came here after that 2 hour hike through Parc du Mt Royal!"  A salad, rice and some of the best seasoned fries I've tasted is literally piled high on your plate.  I'm glad the wife and I shared a plate because I had just enough room for that Portuguese egg tart and coconut flan.  The egg tart was flaky, chewy and creamy all at the same time.  And if you like flan, just imagine flan with a little coconut rum like twist . . . Miam!Excellent food . . . Happy wallet!Well, nothing's perfect. On the one hand, the food here is consistently delicious and cheap; the kind of feel-good food you treat yourself to on a weekend or a busy weeknight. You've seen the reviews.On the other hand, ordering from here is a huge pain. Ordering in advance serves no real purpose (I've ended up waiting longer than the walk-ins every time) and the line system is confusing and poorly laid out. For instance, there's a reason every fast food place ever has you order and pay at the start : it avoids the type of checkout bottleneck that is at this point a staple of Romados. Another annoyance is the two side-by-side order lines with no divider; a solution that would be much more elegant and effective than 3 different signs above and below customers' line of sight (cue arguments with other patrons). And another: no credit card and no paywave payments make payment unnecessarily slow every time. I could go on.But when all is said and done, the chicken is so good that I still end up braving the crowds and coming here nearly once a week. Problem is, Romados' management knows it, too.Worth the hype; Ramados offers authentic Portuguese style rotisserie chicken with addictive sauces and good service. The chicken is butterflied and chopped into finger food sized pieces. The skin is very crispy and beautifully seasoned. Order ahead to avoid lines. However,  we showed up to a lineup that stretched to the door and did not have to wait long as the staff bagged chicken after chicken with surprising speed. If you're hungry; get the whole chicken for two. Fries are also delicious from here. The salad is nothing to rave about but then again this place is not about eating salad. Staff is friendly and efficient.Often imitated rarely (but many places are trying) duplicated. Romados is the benchmark for Portuguese chicken and fries in Montreal. It's been a while since I've eaten here and can't believe I haven't reviewed it but here we go. Came here with out of town friends on a Friday night to explain this joint is a staple in Montreal dining. We arrived at near 8PM and the line was almost out the door. I explained to my friends the wait was well worth it. 20 minutes later we were eating delicious tender succulent charcoal grilled chicken. The flavour is really out of this world. The mix of the spicy sauce and grilled flavour is 7th heaven. The fries are light and heaping in serving. Also provided was a small salad. My friends had to try the chicken poutine and it came as a massive serving with a heap of chopped chicken. Words that come to my mind about Romados: sublime, delicious, light, flavourful, spice, seasoned, fall off the bone tender, huge portions, tasty awesome and inexpensive! If you don't eat here you are missing out on one of Montreal's finest dining experiences!Arriving at a good time, the lineup behind me got massive!   We only had 4-5 parties in front of us, and the line moved quickly.The chicken is divine.   It is cooked on a rotisserie with a dry rub, and you can add a spicy sauce to it - which wasn't spicy at all, but very tasty.  They toss the chicken bits into a bag, and off you go.   There is minimal seating inside so plan to eat elsewhere - there is a nearby park with picnic tables we found.   Service is quick, and this place is popular for a reason - great chicken.One of my absolute pet peeves is going to a restaurant and being served dry chicken. Fortunately, this is not the case!This used to be one of my favorite places to grab lunch in Montreal. The chicken is very juicy and tender. It is seasoned perfectly with tons of flavor from each bite. Everything is fairly priced and the portions they give are reasonable. Definitely a great place, unfortunately it is a bit far and inconvenient to go.Very satisfied and highly recommended!Hot restaurant served hot food but cold tart.... It seemed to be lined up all the time because the price was very reasonable for such large portion of chicken. I had 1/4 chicken with half rice and half fries(Thank the friendly staff for meeting my requirements :) . But honestly, I expected to taste much flavourful chicken not just salty. Even all the side dishes, salad, rice and fries are better than chicken. The bread was good but the tart was not crisp at all!! The cold stuffing was too sweet. So, I only can give it 3 stars.So I have nothing to say against the food. The chicken is always super tasty and well cooked. My chicken sandwich was excellent and my salad was good. The only thing is I wish they put a bit more love in their service. I mean the lady literally throw a huge handful of salad in my styrofoam box, add way too much dressing and force the cover to close.

It comes with a crispy on the outside, tender on the inside rotisserie chicken slathered with a spicy, citrusy Portuguese barbecue sauce that'll make you say, "Thank Goodness we came here after that 2 hour hike through Parc du Mt Royal!"  A salad, rice and some of the best seasoned fries I've tasted is literally piled high on your plate.  I'm glad the wife and I shared a plate because I had just enough room for that Portuguese egg tart and coconut flan.  The egg tart was flaky, chewy and creamy all at the same time.  And if you like flan, just imagine flan with a little coconut rum like twist . . . Miam!Excellent food . . . Happy wallet!Well, nothing's perfect. On the one hand, the food here is consistently delicious and cheap; the kind of feel-good food you treat yourself to on a weekend or a busy weeknight. You've seen the reviews.On the other hand, ordering from here is a huge pain. Ordering in advance serves no real purpose (I've ended up waiting longer than the walk-ins every time) and the line system is confusing and poorly laid out. For instance, there's a reason every fast food place ever has you order and pay at the start : it avoids the type of checkout bottleneck that is at this point a staple of Romados. Another annoyance is the two side-by-side order lines with no divider; a solution that would be much more elegant and effective than 3 different signs above and below customers' line of sight (cue arguments with other patrons). And another: no credit card and no paywave payments make payment unnecessarily slow every time. I could go on.But when all is said and done, the chicken is so good that I still end up braving the crowds and coming here nearly once a week. Problem is, Romados' management knows it, too.Worth the hype; Ramados offers authentic Portuguese style rotisserie chicken with addictive sauces and good service. The chicken is butterflied and chopped into finger food sized pieces. The skin is very crispy and beautifully seasoned. Order ahead to avoid lines. However,  we showed up to a lineup that stretched to the door and did not have to wait long as the staff bagged chicken after chicken with surprising speed. If you're hungry; get the whole chicken for two. Fries are also delicious from here. The salad is nothing to rave about but then again this place is not about eating salad. Staff is friendly and efficient.Often imitated rarely (but many places are trying) duplicated. Romados is the benchmark for Portuguese chicken and fries in Montreal. It's been a while since I've eaten here and can't believe I haven't reviewed it but here we go. Came here with out of town friends on a Friday night to explain this joint is a staple in Montreal dining. We arrived at near 8PM and the line was almost out the door. I explained to my friends the wait was well worth it. 20 minutes later we were eating delicious tender succulent charcoal grilled chicken. The flavour is really out of this world. The mix of the spicy sauce and grilled flavour is 7th heaven. The fries are light and heaping in serving. Also provided was a small salad. My friends had to try the chicken poutine and it came as a massive serving with a heap of chopped chicken. Words that come to my mind about Romados: sublime, delicious, light, flavourful, spice, seasoned, fall off the bone tender, huge portions, tasty awesome and inexpensive! If you don't eat here you are missing out on one of Montreal's finest dining experiences!Arriving at a good time, the lineup behind me got massive!   We only had 4-5 parties in front of us, and the line moved quickly.The chicken is divine.   It is cooked on a rotisserie with a dry rub, and you can add a spicy sauce to it - which wasn't spicy at all, but very tasty.  They toss the chicken bits into a bag, and off you go.   There is minimal seating inside so plan to eat elsewhere - there is a nearby park with picnic tables we found.   Service is quick, and this place is popular for a reason - great chicken.One of my absolute pet peeves is going to a restaurant and being served dry chicken. Fortunately, this is not the case!This used to be one of my favorite places to grab lunch in Montreal. The chicken is very juicy and tender. It is seasoned perfectly with tons of flavor from each bite. Everything is fairly priced and the portions they give are reasonable. Definitely a great place, unfortunately it is a bit far and inconvenient to go.Very satisfied and highly recommended!Hot restaurant served hot food but cold tart.... It seemed to be lined up all the time because the price was very reasonable for such large portion of chicken. I had 1/4 chicken with half rice and half fries(Thank the friendly staff for meeting my requirements :) . But honestly, I expected to taste much flavourful chicken not just salty. Even all the side dishes, salad, rice and fries are better than chicken. The bread was good but the tart was not crisp at all!! The cold stuffing was too sweet. So, I only can give it 3 stars.So I have nothing to say against the food. The chicken is always super tasty and well cooked. My chicken sandwich was excellent and my salad was good. The only thing is I wish they put a bit more love in their service. I mean the lady literally throw a huge handful of salad in my styrofoam box, add way too much dressing and force the cover to close. So I'm walking with salad hanging out my box and dressing dripping all over...not the end of the world but I like love served with my food. That's all.Love the chicken and desserts. Fries as well! But always busy the place so recommend to go.First and only time i've had portuguese chicken and I was not dissapointed. The chicken was very flavourful and juicy. You get a huge box of fries and chicken for about 10$. Would visit every time i'm in the neighborhood.Forget all the other chicken places when in Montreal.  Romados hands down has the best chicken in the city.When you come to Romados, you will notice that they have classic Portuguese fair on the menu, bifanas, fish, etc, but I can't stress it enough, ORDER THE CHICKEN.  You won't be disappointed.  It comes with seasoned fries and a little salad.  When the person at the counter asks if you want sauce, say yes! Sauce on the chicken but also tell him or her to put on the fried.  Trust me.As you sit down and open the box, just be careful.  The fries might be overflowing.When you will bite into the perfectly cooked chicken, you won't be able to help but notice how crispy the skin is and how juicy and smokey the meat is.  It literally falls off the bone! Just make sure you lick those bones clean, I sure know I do!I don't live in Montreal anymore, but when I do come back, I make sure I make a pit stop at Romados.  Every time my friends tell me they're going to Montreal, I tell them they have to go to Romados.  They come back thanking me and telling me that it was the best chicken they have had in their lives!  YES, I'm serious!Once you're done, if you still have space left, get one of their pasteis de nata (Portuguese custard tarts).  Simply delicious.  By far the best place for Portuguese chicken, or any chicken for that matter, in Montreal.  There's a reason that there's always a line up.Super moist chicken, and great desserts! Protip - dont take pics of their chicken behind in the kitchen i was yelled at in french by a very angry lady. We ordered half a chicken and sides to share with some friends. The spicy sauce was really tasty but not quite spicy so hot food friends might be disappointed. I'd come here as a regular for sure if I lived nearby!This was the best meal I had in Montreal. I ate at Joe Beef, and all the top restaurants in old town and Rotissire Romados kicked them all to the curb. 1/2 chicken with spicy sauce, fresh fries, and salad... all for under $10? You seriously can't beat that. The chicken juices and hot sauce seep into the fries if you let it sit for a few minutes. Take yours to-go, walk down to La Fontaine Park and enjoy the best chicken while sitting on the grass. I wish we had a restaurant like this in San Francisco!used to live in MTL and this was a staple of the city... A fire closed their doors for a while and they took the opportunity to give it a facelift. Chicken is second to none. Order for pickup to avoid crazy lineups mid day.This is yet another establishment which makes Montreal Montreal. Nothing fancy, no gimmicks, no attitude and amazing prices. Just roasted Portuguese chicken, fries, sauce, salad and a bread and Portuguese and French pastry counter.There is absolutely nothing more that I can add except to say that if you are visiting Montreal or a naive Montrealer who has never gone then GO. Like NOW.Chicken roasted to perfection, juicy and yet still practically falling off the bone. So good that you're going to use your hand to get right into the bone as well.And then the fries. These are perfect salt and pepper fries, which reminded me of the salt and pepper chips which the Kettle brand makes. Try to get them slathered with the spicy sauce and it's a joygasm in your mouth. They also sell homemade Portuguese sausages, buns and of course natas, their sweet egg custard cups which are probably the best in the city.For $13 bucks for a whole chicken, it's worth your while to pick up a bird or two, a large order of fries and take them home, keep them in glass containers to keep them fresh, and you have a great lunch meal to take to work for a couple of days.While you're waiting in line, it's an interesting place to people watch. Everybody seems to come here, I saw Portuguese aunties, guys from the hip hop crowd, snotty Westmount chicks waiting in the Land Rovers outside, professionals coming from work and everyone in between. That's the thing about great food; it brings everyone together.Went there yesterday hoping to get a tasty meal on an empty stomach. Sunday night around 6pm. I waited in line 20 mins, and a third of the line had passed. I still had 2/3rds in front of me, so I left, I couldn't wait another 40. I wish I could speak for the chicken, but it looks like not. Looks like they need to rethink operations.//Vibe|Wait\\Although in a hipster area, this place isn't hipster at all. Has that classic neighborhood bakery look/feel. There are two lines, if you're only ordering bread/pastries/stuff from the freezer, get on the bakery side. Chicken is the left side.Rotisserie doesn't start until 11 am. So if you show up early and there's no line, that's because only the bakery is open. Once lunch time rolls around, no matter what day of the week, there is a wait. We queued up at 11:30 and even though the line wasn't out the door, we still waited maybe more than 30 mins. So if you live in the area, call ahead. Limited seating, but when we went, not many people were sitting to eat, so you might find an open table during lunch time so long as your group is small.//Food\\Very reasonable prices, generous portions of fries (short, thick cut). For the popularity and wait time, I just didn't get the hype behind the chicken. Maybe I should've gotten the spicy seasoning, because beside a strong taste of wine, the chicken didn't taste that special to me. It's not bad, but not a taste I'd wait so long in line for. The seasoning on the fries are good, but a little too sweet for me. You get a lot of fries for what you order, so think twice before placing a separate order or even going for the medium or large fries.I really liked the egg tarts.The crust itself was thick, chewy, layered, and flavorful. A good pastry base, which isn't always present in most egg tarts. Although the custard was much too sweet for me (with a smooth and non-curdled consistency), I was pretty impressed by the crust, and my kids thought these were the best they'd ever had.Chicken made with crack.THE FOODI have never had rotisserie that was so compelling, this is something else. The chorizo is excellent too. The fries are not bad either, and they also have a pretty amazing bakery section.THE SERVICEPretty friendly and efficient.THE ATMOSPHEREBusy, hip, bustling.Good price value. Everything on the menu is pretty good, but they are competing with a lot of good Portuguese places in the area. The service could be a bit more friendly.
