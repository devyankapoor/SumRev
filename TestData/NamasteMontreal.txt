The moment you walk into Namaste Montreal you're enveloped in a warm rich smell that blows you away. After 3 years in Montreal eating very average Indian food I was delighted to try out Namaste! Their food is perfectly spiced but not spicy and absolutely not oily. The value of their meals makes this place a real winner. I got a plate with daal (lentils), sabji (vegetables), naan and rice for $10! Namaste is a real keeper. My advice is call in advance and do a pick up if you're in a larger group or sit in and enjoy some bollywood beats, solo or with a buddy. Tip: order the mango lassi to temper the well spiced Indian meal.Super delicious ! Simple decor, but I like what they hang on the wall, and they have a recycling book system - give a book and take a book, which was pretty cool The owner is super nice and the food is delicious. Large portions and I really really liked the naan. Will definitely be back.We had heard about this place from friends. Came for a quick lunch one freezing Friday and we were greeted by a smile and great service. Food was awesome and we had the pleasure of tasting the spiciness before selecting our dish as it was very quiet before lunch rush. It will be our "go-to" Indian place in central Montreal now.Tip: If you are expecting lavish surrounds this is not for you. It is rustic and homely and "rough-and-ready" but I have no problem with this when the focus is on the foodReally nice place in the McGill Ghetto, especially during the cold months. Make sure to pickup some samosas on your way to class!Awesome, home-made style indian cuisine. The owner is always on premises and super-friendly.There are extremely few restaurants in McGill ghetto that are not on St. Laurent. Its cheap + independent and has a little-guy feelThe food is totally decent cafeteria style indian, not too greasy very small dining roomSome might be put off by the kitchen, which you can kind of see from dining room.  I'm not that squeamish but some of my dinner companions felt weird about the level of cleanliness in the place. I would most likely go back.the food was really fresh and delicious. im sure. cuz i tried it in my country but its really different. and worker was so kind. if u wanna take out, call for order and take out. it should be better :)Namaste Montreal - a tiny, unpretentious Indian restaurant and take-away joint - opened its doors two months ago in the McGill Ghetto, directly across the street from local favourite Amelios.Featuring only 3-4 tables, counter service, and a small menu, Namaste is nonetheless quickly taking on the proud sheen of a popular neighbourhood gem. On a snowy Wednesday evening around 8:30 PM, a steady stream of both eat-in and take-away customers moved through the small space - with plenty of curious passers-by taking a moment to read the menu in the window. This menu is complemented by tasty daily specials. At the time of our visit, Namaste was already sold out of several popular menu items - like lentil dishes and the lamb curry.We ordered a samosa, a large butter chicken combo, and a thali plate with chana masala curry and chicken curry. Both plates were served piping hot, with delicious naan, rice, and fresh (although limited) salad. You can choose your level of spice - "mild, medium, very spicy" - and dress up your meal with homemade chutney and pickle offerings. The food was quite flavourful and was excellent value, with the thali plate costing $8.99 and the butter chicken combo only $7.99. The service is very friendly and attentive, and the overall experience is like eating in someone's kitchen. That being said, given the small space and the serving of even eat-in meals in large styrofoam trays, Namaste is strong on a delicious take-out experience. It's a welcome addition to a neighbourhood that's been lacking in very good, inexpensive Indian food.Great food, great price (student here). I've had almost everything on the menu and I enjoyed all of it. Wonderful staff! I usually get takeout but have also eaten in the restaurant. Unpretentious and friendly place. Have gone a lot and will go again. Cash only.I think this is the most unpretentious nice indian restaurant. Lots of Mc Gill student  go to this place  for take out food, because the place is pretty small ( 2 little table). But the food is excellent and it's pretty cheap like 10-12$ for a plate and a soft drink but who cares if the food is good. I ordered a veggie plate with eggplants and it was delicious. It's good if you want to have delicious indians take out food. We ate there ( we were 4) but it's very small.Anyway just order take out food you'll be surprise of the quality 
The food is amazing especially there naan and shahi paneer the place is very small though its probably good to take out your food rather than eating there.I just discovered this place while searching out an available BIXI on Milton.  Since it is close to my work, I have the opportunity to stop by on my way home for a tasty samosa snack.  I have done that several days in a row and today I finally hit up the spot for a full lunch with a colleague.  Oh my, butter chicken goodness!  Naan, rice, butter chicken and a mango lassi to drink for 12$ and my friend had a vegetarian combo for 11$ (with mango lassi).  I will definitely go back for delicious and affordable Indian food!  Super friendly service too.The curry in this place is way too spicy, and too hot. The selection is quite small and rather expensive for the price you pay for. The butter chicken was not the red creamy curry I've had in other places, and I suspect that all the curry came fron the same yellow base, lacking the richness. If you just want some cheap indian takeout, come here, but don't expect any authenticity.Very bare, spare and to the bones decor with only 3 tables, which can seat 4 each, plastic cutlery, melamine thali plates, and the great piece de resistance,...... brown paper towels as napkins! You need to go up to the counter, order you choice of dish, wait, then pick it up at the said counter, all in the wonderful melamine plate  sitting on a brown ugly tray. Take  your plastic cutlery from the box near the cash, tear off a strip of brown paper from the roll next to the cutlery box, go to your table, and you're ready to eat. I ordered a masala chicken, not much chicken, but the naan was good and hot,  the rice was fine, but the salad was just  stewed chickpeas! I asked about that, and the gentleman behind the counter informed me that this is due to all the McGill lords and ladies not being used to Indian -style salad,  would leave it on their plates, so hence, no salad. Boo Hoo! They got tired of wasting all the uneaten food. He did inform that they will experiment with a salad more suited to the western palate, I do hope so , as I LOVE salad, any style! They are  only open at certain hours,and days,  so best to check BEFORE going, and make sure to arrive before the rush, as obviously, due to space, or lack of, it fills up FAST. If you're the take out type, this is better suited then; prices are reasonable for the downtown/plateau area and you're given a"points" card after your first order.  Collect a full card of "points" and get a freebie.you gotta love this place! it's small, it doesn't look special or anything, but the food is phenomenal, pretty authentic (according to some of my indian friends i've gone with), and cheap. i went for lunch here a few weeks ago after a night of drinking, i was absolutely starving, and the butter chicken hit the spot like nothing else i could've gotten.the people here are friendly too! they always ask if you enjoyed your meal, and seem to really care.
