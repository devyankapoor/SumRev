Honestly, I've been to a couple of sushi places, but this is the spot!The atmosphere is great and the food is even better.   Make a reservation and try to sit at the bar and get to know the artist that creat your dishes.  The food is as wonderful as they are.  Go NOW!!This is a great sushi place - the quality of everything on the menu is top notch.  Every roll and dish has new, interesting and diverse flavour combinations and everything tastes incredibly fresh.  I ordered the tasting menu, which costs about $25. 00 and included three courses: one small sashimi plate, two "Christmas Trees" (lobster on a cracker; it's delicious), and a final sushi/maki plate with a selection of whatever the chef decides to put on it that night.  Every single item was tasty as hell.  The service was excellent too, our waiter was friendly and explained all of the dishes to us nicely.  The only reason I didn't give a 5 star review of this place is that I was left a little hungry upon leaving.  This isn't necessarily a problem, the food was amazing and I'm sure about 70% of people don't need anything more, but for $25. 00, even two or three more rolls would've gone a long way to leaving me satisfied. Overall, brilliant place.  Best sushi I've had in Montreal. I admit this place is quite unique, but way way overpriced.  We ordered the tasting menu, and for something like $25/ person, we were extremely unsatisfied after finishing the meal.  All three of us were hungry after finishing the three-course tasting menu.  The first course was some salmon and tuna sashimi with green apple slices and a sake based sauce.  These tiny thin cut slices were delicious, but only included a tiny taste of each (2 slices of super thin fish/ person).  Then came the christmas trees.  These were alright, but there seemed to be a trend from this dish onwards with an overuse of mayo that kinda dulled the natural flavours of the seafood.  The presentation, however, was unique and well-crafted.  Next, was the 6 "rolls" that came out.  And I put the rolls in quotation marks because they really just give you parts of a roll and expect that to be enough.  Two rolls were put into rice paper rather than nori, which gave it an interesting texture, and were probably the best ones on the plate.  One roll was wrapped in cucumber and was fairly tasteless and underwhelming.  The deep fried roll tasted like oil and wasn't very good at all.  Again, in the rolls, mayo was overused and masked the natural flavours of fish.  The restaurant had a really cool vibe and was really quite busy.  Service was good.  The food was interesting, but overpriced.  I literally could have ordered a single roll at a different sushi restaurant and have been more full and paid less than I did with this tasting menu.  I would not come here again.  If it weren't for the nice little restaurant setting and the good service, I'd be giving this place a 2/5. Again, theory is confirmed, the best seat in any restaurant is at the bar.  That's where the action is at!At Saint Sushi you will not be disappointed by owner Saeng who is always having a great time, pounding out his creation one after the next.  My friend and I were enjoying his humming, singing and dancing along classic hits such as "Kiss on my List" by Hall & Oates and "Hypnotize" by the one and only Notorious B. I. G. Inside is a surreal restaurant, with a fantastic atmosphere and eclectically decorated with Laotian traditional paintings & statues, but you'll also find an Alice in Wonderland's Rabbit pendant clock, an elephant sporting a NY Yankees baseball hat, various shaped lamps and so many more items that don't quite fit together but somehow make sense here!The menu contains an assortment of options.  We went for the tasting menu which was surprisingly affordable! My favorites so far was the Christmas Tree, a conifer-like mounted mixture of lobster, tobiko, masago, scallions and bits of tempura I believe.  Close second is the Beatles which is a lobster maki encased in a cucumber sheet with enoki mushrooms topped with Tuna and Salmon sashimi.  The joyfully named maki rolls were actually inspired from artists that owner Saeng grew up with: Bob Marley, Madonna, Marvin Gaye, Michael Jackson, Tupac and many more - take the time to ask why and you'll chuckle. When asked about the restaurant name, Saeng mentioned that he used to love visiting many cities outside Montreal, that always seemed to the start with 'St-Something'. . .  hence Saint Sushi was born (St-Montreal didn't quite sound right)!The only drawbacks of this place is that they do not have a liquor license, which is not a bad thing as you can focus on the food. . .  and the wait time, even when you have a reservation; which is also kinda ok in case you arrive late.  Otherwise, if your are in for an unconventional sushi stop, then you've found it!Read good reviews about this place so decided to give it a try. Decor is pretty cool with lots of thai influence.  We had no reservation so had to sit at the sushi bar which was fine with me because I like watching the chefs roll their sushi. My friend and I ordered 2 miso soup and the combo called Cycle which included 10 pieces of maki, 4 pièces of sushi, 2 pieces of the Christmas tree and sashimi. First came the miso soup. . . oh god it was salty!!!. . . barely took 2 sips.  When we told the waiter, he said he would not charge us for them. . . ok. As for the sushi, definitely cannot be called authentic.  There is a lot of fruits used in the roll. . . which kind of masked the taste of the fish in the sushi rolls.  Sushi in Japan is all about the fish. . . keeping everything simple so thay you can taste the freshness of the fish.  It was good sushi but not something I would call authentic.  You know it is fusion sushi when you see non japanese/Asian making sushi :pAlthough not the best I have tried but for the price, it is a pretty good bang for your buck.  The service was also pretty good.  I would go back for some affordable sushi and the sushi chef was very funny and made this experience a lot more fun. If you've ever been to Tri Express and loved it, but found that the seating situation was less than ideal, than this is the place for you.  I think the chef here used to work for Tri because the flavour profile is almost identical.  That special flavour they put in very roll that you just can't wrap your taste buds around (unami maybe?) is found in all the sushi's here as well.  They also have that yummy tartar topped on a cracker found at Tri that goes by the name 'Christmas tree'Super affordable and set in a larger space with tables of decent size, it's a very nice place to enjoy a weekday sushi outing. Get the chefs tasting menu (23. 50$), you won't be disappointed.  Only downside is that, like Tri, they don't have an alcohol permit so you can't pair a good sake with the delicious sushi. The decor of Saint Sushi Bar doesn't follow your typical Japanese restaurant.  Really, I thought that I was in some sort of Indo-Thai restaurant.  But just as unconventional as the decor was, the menu was amazing.  Named after pop culture's famous icons, each sushi roll was as unique as the people it represented.  No, you won't just taste a massive whiff of spicy mayo in each but you'll actually get to taste intriguing combinations of flavors.  Which is why the tasting platter is an excellent choice.  Don't worry, there are traditional sushi in the menu but the "celebrity" ones are must tries.  On top of excellent creative sushi, the staffs were extremely down to earth.  My jokes were replied with more jokes coming from the waitress, one of the chefs kept telling us across two tables to not hesitate if we had any questions, another member showed serious concerns about my friend's broken finger which was wrapped in a cast and wished for her well-being.  It felt as if we were welcomed not as clients but as professional friends. Saint Sushi Bar really deserves a top spot on Yelp.  Do yourself a favor and add this place to your food bucket list. Had an a-ok lunch here today.  Shared a few rolls with a friend and they were all tasty.   Considering that the avocado in my rolls were brown and dotted black, and that all the rolls looked like they were slapped together by an amateur, I'd have to say presentation was lacking.  For how much it cost, I'd say it's pretty average.  All in all a tasty experience, probably aided by the use of tons of mayo in their rolls. I'm usually really picky with my sushi.  I always have certain types of them I order, for instance like the California role.  So once I went here, I saw the menu, and they dont have a lot of options from the usual ones, so I was sure I wouldnt like this place. But we decided to order the chef's choice and a few classic ones just in case.  The food came and OMG it was so good! My favorite was the one called "Christmas Tree", its almost only samon but I loved it.  I'd come back here again for sure. P. S.  its better if you have a reservation there, as the place is small, and we had to wait a bit since we didn't have a reservationWe had a great time at Saint Sushi.  The tasting menu was really delicious.  Make a reservation to save yourself any grief.  The michael jackson roll was very good.  The Christmas Tree was good too.  The staff is very friendly and lots of fun.   Overall, a nice place to enjoy some fusion Sushi. If you are in Montreal, pass by and check it out.  You wont be disappointed. Hands down my favorite sushi place in Montreal.  The price/quality ratio is unbeatable. I like how they put the focus on the quality of the fish instead of using rice as a filler like many places do.  You MUST try the " christmas tree " it's unbelievably good.  Everything i've had was delicious, I randomly get cravings for their sushi. Service is always excellent, chefs are super friendly and ambiance is nice.  I love their funky playlist, whoever is choosing these tracks is amazing. Great tasting menu deal for $23. 50 incl tax.  Recommend coming here if you're craving sushi! A lot of the rolls are spicy salmon based with some variation.  The guys at the counter making sushi are a fun group that engages with the customers.  The tasting menu encompasses 3 courses: for starter, the salmon and tuna sashimi with Apple salad on top, second part of the course is what they call  "Christmas trees" which is piled on spicy salmon and lobster over a rice cracker (so so good!), and the third course is various sushi rolls which kind of all pretty similar in terms of taste (predominately spicy salmon or tuna based) with different complementary ingredients.  I thoroughly enjoyed the meal and the service! Would come back here again when I'm in Montreal. Was brought here by my trusted Yelp friend, Brian C and the place did not disappoint.  We got the tasting menu and I still can't believe how tasty it was and reasonably priced, it felt like that Ikea commercial where the woman buys a bunch of stuff and starts running out and yelling at her husband to "start the car!" The warm Michael Jackson roll was my fave, but all of the fish tasted so good and the rolls were all different enough to make me think that I was back in Vancouver eating close to the ocean and not deep in the heart of the Plateau. The staff here are all so much fun and laughed with us, gave us thorough explanations of everything and made us feel welcome.  Next time I go, I'll definitely sit at the bar because that looked like even more fun.  This place draws people of all ages and the presentation of the food somehow is so gorgeous despite how quickly they were able to get it prepared and onto our table. The only sorta bummer here is that they don't have a liquor licence and you can't bring your own, but hey, it keeps people moving in and out quickly, so you'll never have to wait long for a table.  Reservations are highly recommended as the space is fairly small. Food: the menu degustation is a good option for a first visit.  Its a 3 courses meal:1-Sashimi with apple, fresh in the mouth and the dressing is light and flavourful. 2-sapin de noel (salmon and shrimps tartar).  I like the crunchy and spicy of that dish. 3-mixed of makis chef's choice, alot of swag in the maki just like the names of them (Bob marley, MJ, etc) i like it!.  The sake reduction sauce is really good, a nice complement with the makis. Service: super friendly and quick!Ambiance: alot people, crowded place.  any sushi fan will like it. Conclusion: im coming back!The food was good and the visual was amazing, All french on the menu so was hard to understand, however the staff there was so kind helped and cared of us (Not only us she is just the best! haha).  If you want to try new sushi, I strongly recommend hereThis is definitely very unique.  Their sushi menu is quite interesting and stands out from many other sushi restaurants because they are creative.  I didn't like the creativity as much as I thought I would because I expected authentic Japanese when I visited. They definitely had some delicious rolls, but if you're looking for authentic sushi, this might not be the best place to go for that.  On the other hand, if you want to have sushi and you're not the biggest fan of raw fish, this might be better for you.  They have a tasting menu that's not on their menu, so make sure to ask your server about it if your'e interested - I had the tasting menu, and I think it's worth a try, because you get a lot more than ordering a la carte.  Overall, I had great service and I had a great dinner date with my husband.  Though it didn't have a lot of variety in their fish, it was a unique experience. I was very unimpressed.  With such high ratings, I was expecting a lot more.  I had the 1person prix fix which included salmon sashimi with Apple, two small bite called Christmas tree, and 2 rolls.  I enjoyed the Christmas tree small bites but it was again repeated in my rolls.  A little overkill.  It's delicious because I think they mixed in ritz crackers crumbles in the lobster slaw.  Just a guess! Very Hawaiian style sushi dining which is good but maybe not what I was looking for. Overall, this is my favorite sushi place and I would recommend it to everyone.  However, I do have a story related to what makes this place special. Alright! Here's the story. It was the third time I had been to this place.  The moment I walked through the door, I was greeted by the gentleman who served me the previous time I was there, which was a month ago. As I was assigned my seat, he says "Hey, ça va?" as if we knew each other already.  I was caught off guard.  To my amazement, I realized that he remembered me.  He pointed to the exact spot, to the left near the bar, which my date and I were seated last time.  At that moment, it felt special for me.  It made me feel valued as a customer. I finally realized what made this place amongst the top rated restaurants on Yelp.  Of course, we can go on and on about the food and decor.  In the end, there's one element that the staff adds to this place which makes it wonderful, the personal touch.  It's a laid back environment with great service and even greater people.  They're basically your friends who happen to serve you food!*Even if you have allergies, they will make the adjustments necessary to assure you have a great experience. As for the food, when you open the menu, you don't get overwhelmed with all the items.  They provide a good variety, without having the complication of your table coming up with a whole system to what food item every person wants. For the people who want to keep it simple in the decision making, you can go for the "Tasting Menu," where you get to taste all their different types of sushi and see what Saint Sushi Bar is all about.  Simply put, this is where you flood your taste buds with euphoria.  All at an affordable price of $22 per person!Take a look at all the photos.  Once you're done salivating, go check this place out.  Have fun!Best sushi place I've been.  Music is awesome, very chill R&B music playing and just a fun hipster atmosphere, come here,  you'll love it!Location: Tucked away on Duluth, just off of St.  Denis (head east).  The closest subway is Mont-Royal or you can try your luck with street parking. The place: Teeny tiny, but it's got BIG energy.  The space is nothing fancy but it offers up a chill, comfortable vibe.  The guys who run this place also have excellent taste in music so you don't need to worry about having to listen to elevator music or that pop crap.  The goods: Honestly, I could write a short novel about how goddamn good the sushi is here, but I won't.  All you need to know is that SS serves up top notch cuisine using quality ingredients and everything is made upon order.  I tried the tasting menu that included such goodies as the Bob Marley, the Beatles, the Madonna and the Michael Jackson, among others.  The starter was salmon sashimi in a sake reduction.  Jesus, it was good.  Our second dish was the 'Christmas tree' - a lovely concoction of seafood served on a rice cracker.  Our waiter Ali (hope I spelled that right!), told me the present wasn't on the bottom but rather, on the top - and he was right.  It was so incredibly flavourful that I could feast on this alone.  The grand finale was a beautiful sushi platter and every item on it rocked.  Hello - can I move in?Service: Phenomenal.  Ali, Saeng, Ralph and our host whose name I unfortunately didn't get, were amazing.  You can't ask for friendlier people to accompany a wonderful meal.  I had a great chat with the guys and they let me know that they were basically a group of childhood friends who decided to work together.  They really seem to love what they do and it's obvious that they mesh well.  A huge white gangsta shout-out to these fine gents. Price point: Super affordable - the tasting menu is $22 tax in, per person.  So. . .  What are you waiting for? Go! But be warned - you'll need a reservation on weekends.  This place is too cool for school. Honestly, I've been to a couple of sushi places, but this is the spot!The atmosphere is great and the food is even better.   Make a reservation and try to sit at the bar and get to know the artist that creat your dishes.

Simply put, this is where you flood your taste buds with euphoria.  All at an affordable price of $22 per person!Take a look at all the photos.  Once you're done salivating, go check this place out.  Have fun!Best sushi place I've been.  Music is awesome, very chill R&B music playing and just a fun hipster atmosphere, come here,  you'll love it!Location: Tucked away on Duluth, just off of St.  Denis (head east).  The closest subway is Mont-Royal or you can try your luck with street parking. The place: Teeny tiny, but it's got BIG energy.  The space is nothing fancy but it offers up a chill, comfortable vibe.  The guys who run this place also have excellent taste in music so you don't need to worry about having to listen to elevator music or that pop crap.  The goods: Honestly, I could write a short novel about how goddamn good the sushi is here, but I won't.  All you need to know is that SS serves up top notch cuisine using quality ingredients and everything is made upon order.  I tried the tasting menu that included such goodies as the Bob Marley, the Beatles, the Madonna and the Michael Jackson, among others.  The starter was salmon sashimi in a sake reduction.  Jesus, it was good.  Our second dish was the 'Christmas tree' - a lovely concoction of seafood served on a rice cracker.  Our waiter Ali (hope I spelled that right!), told me the present wasn't on the bottom but rather, on the top - and he was right.  It was so incredibly flavourful that I could feast on this alone.  The grand finale was a beautiful sushi platter and every item on it rocked.  Hello - can I move in?Service: Phenomenal.  Ali, Saeng, Ralph and our host whose name I unfortunately didn't get, were amazing.  You can't ask for friendlier people to accompany a wonderful meal.  I had a great chat with the guys and they let me know that they were basically a group of childhood friends who decided to work together.  They really seem to love what they do and it's obvious that they mesh well.  A huge white gangsta shout-out to these fine gents. Price point: Super affordable - the tasting menu is $22 tax in, per person.  So. . .  What are you waiting for? Go! But be warned - you'll need a reservation on weekends.  This place is too cool for school. Honestly, I've been to a couple of sushi places, but this is the spot!The atmosphere is great and the food is even better.   Make a reservation and try to sit at the bar and get to know the artist that creat your dishes.  The food is as wonderful as they are.  Go NOW!!This is a great sushi place - the quality of everything on the menu is top notch.  Every roll and dish has new, interesting and diverse flavour combinations and everything tastes incredibly fresh.  I ordered the tasting menu, which costs about $25. 00 and included three courses: one small sashimi plate, two "Christmas Trees" (lobster on a cracker; it's delicious), and a final sushi/maki plate with a selection of whatever the chef decides to put on it that night.  Every single item was tasty as hell.  The service was excellent too, our waiter was friendly and explained all of the dishes to us nicely.  The only reason I didn't give a 5 star review of this place is that I was left a little hungry upon leaving.  This isn't necessarily a problem, the food was amazing and I'm sure about 70% of people don't need anything more, but for $25. 00, even two or three more rolls would've gone a long way to leaving me satisfied. Overall, brilliant place.  Best sushi I've had in Montreal. I admit this place is quite unique, but way way overpriced.  We ordered the tasting menu, and for something like $25/ person, we were extremely unsatisfied after finishing the meal.  All three of us were hungry after finishing the three-course tasting menu.  The first course was some salmon and tuna sashimi with green apple slices and a sake based sauce.  These tiny thin cut slices were delicious, but only included a tiny taste of each (2 slices of super thin fish/ person).  Then came the christmas trees.  These were alright, but there seemed to be a trend from this dish onwards with an overuse of mayo that kinda dulled the natural flavours of the seafood.  The presentation, however, was unique and well-crafted.  Next, was the 6 "rolls" that came out.  And I put the rolls in quotation marks because they really just give you parts of a roll and expect that to be enough.  Two rolls were put into rice paper rather than nori, which gave it an interesting texture, and were probably the best ones on the plate.  One roll was wrapped in cucumber and was fairly tasteless and underwhelming.  The deep fried roll tasted like oil and wasn't very good at all.  Again, in the rolls, mayo was overused and masked the natural flavours of fish.  The restaurant had a really cool vibe and was really quite busy.  Service was good.  The food was interesting, but overpriced.  I literally could have ordered a single roll at a different sushi restaurant and have been more full and paid less than I did with this tasting menu.  I would not come here again.  If it weren't for the nice little restaurant setting and the good service, I'd be giving this place a 2/5. Again, theory is confirmed, the best seat in any restaurant is at the bar.  That's where the action is at!At Saint Sushi you will not be disappointed by owner Saeng who is always having a great time, pounding out his creation one after the next.  My friend and I were enjoying his humming, singing and dancing along classic hits such as "Kiss on my List" by Hall & Oates and "Hypnotize" by the one and only Notorious B. I. G. Inside is a surreal restaurant, with a fantastic atmosphere and eclectically decorated with Laotian traditional paintings & statues, but you'll also find an Alice in Wonderland's Rabbit pendant clock, an elephant sporting a NY Yankees baseball hat, various shaped lamps and so many more items that don't quite fit together but somehow make sense here!The menu contains an assortment of options.  We went for the tasting menu which was surprisingly affordable! My favorites so far was the Christmas Tree, a conifer-like mounted mixture of lobster, tobiko, masago, scallions and bits of tempura I believe.  Close second is the Beatles which is a lobster maki encased in a cucumber sheet with enoki mushrooms topped with Tuna and Salmon sashimi.  The joyfully named maki rolls were actually inspired from artists that owner Saeng grew up with: Bob Marley, Madonna, Marvin Gaye, Michael Jackson, Tupac and many more - take the time to ask why and you'll chuckle. When asked about the restaurant name, Saeng mentioned that he used to love visiting many cities outside Montreal, that always seemed to the start with 'St-Something'. . .  hence Saint Sushi was born (St-Montreal didn't quite sound right)!The only drawbacks of this place is that they do not have a liquor license, which is not a bad thing as you can focus on the food. . .  and the wait time, even when you have a reservation; which is also kinda ok in case you arrive late.  Otherwise, if your are in for an unconventional sushi stop, then you've found it!Read good reviews about this place so decided to give it a try. Decor is pretty cool with lots of thai influence.  We had no reservation so had to sit at the sushi bar which was fine with me because I like watching the chefs roll their sushi. My friend and I ordered 2 miso soup and the combo called Cycle which included 10 pieces of maki, 4 pièces of sushi, 2 pieces of the Christmas tree and sashimi. First came the miso soup. . . oh god it was salty!!!. . . barely took 2 sips.  When we told the waiter, he said he would not charge us for them. . . ok. As for the sushi, definitely cannot be called authentic.  There is a lot of fruits used in the roll. . . which kind of masked the taste of the fish in the sushi rolls.  Sushi in Japan is all about the fish. . . keeping everything simple so thay you can taste the freshness of the fish.  It was good sushi but not something I would call authentic.  You know it is fusion sushi when you see non japanese/Asian making sushi :pAlthough not the best I have tried but for the price, it is a pretty good bang for your buck.  The service was also pretty good.  I would go back for some affordable sushi and the sushi chef was very funny and made this experience a lot more fun. If you've ever been to Tri Express and loved it, but found that the seating situation was less than ideal, than this is the place for you.  I think the chef here used to work for Tri because the flavour profile is almost identical.  That special flavour they put in very roll that you just can't wrap your taste buds around (unami maybe?) is found in all the sushi's here as well.  They also have that yummy tartar topped on a cracker found at Tri that goes by the name 'Christmas tree'Super affordable and set in a larger space with tables of decent size, it's a very nice place to enjoy a weekday sushi outing. Get the chefs tasting menu (23. 50$), you won't be disappointed.  Only downside is that, like Tri, they don't have an alcohol permit so you can't pair a good sake with the delicious sushi. The decor of Saint Sushi Bar doesn't follow your typical Japanese restaurant.  Really, I thought that I was in some sort of Indo-Thai restaurant.  But just as unconventional as the decor was, the menu was amazing.  Named after pop culture's famous icons, each sushi roll was as unique as the people it represented.  No, you won't just taste a massive whiff of spicy mayo in each but you'll actually get to taste intriguing combinations of flavors.  Which is why the tasting platter is an excellent choice.  Don't worry, there are traditional sushi in the menu but the "celebrity" ones are must tries.  On top of excellent creative sushi, the staffs were extremely down to earth.  My jokes were replied with more jokes coming from the waitress, one of the chefs kept telling us across two tables to not hesitate if we had any questions, another member showed serious concerns about my friend's broken finger which was wrapped in a cast and wished for her well-being.  It felt as if we were welcomed not as clients but as professional friends. Saint Sushi Bar really deserves a top spot on Yelp.  Do yourself a favor and add this place to your food bucket list. Had an a-ok lunch here today.  Shared a few rolls with a friend and they were all tasty.   Considering that the avocado in my rolls were brown and dotted black, and that all the rolls looked like they were slapped together by an amateur, I'd have to say presentation was lacking.  For how much it cost, I'd say it's pretty average.  All in all a tasty experience, probably aided by the use of tons of mayo in their rolls. I'm usually really picky with my sushi.  I always have certain types of them I order, for instance like the California role.  So once I went here, I saw the menu, and they dont have a lot of options from the usual ones, so I was sure I wouldnt like this place. But we decided to order the chef's choice and a few classic ones just in case.  The food came and OMG it was so good! My favorite was the one called "Christmas Tree", its almost only samon but I loved it.  I'd come back here again for sure. P. S.  its better if you have a reservation there, as the place is small, and we had to wait a bit since we didn't have a reservationWe had a great time at Saint Sushi.  The tasting menu was really delicious.  Make a reservation to save yourself any grief.  The michael jackson roll was very good.  The Christmas Tree was good too.  The staff is very friendly and lots of fun.   Overall, a nice place to enjoy some fusion Sushi. If you are in Montreal, pass by and check it out.  You wont be disappointed. Hands down my favorite sushi place in Montreal.  The price/quality ratio is unbeatable. I like how they put the focus on the quality of the fish instead of using rice as a filler like many places do.  You MUST try the " christmas tree " it's unbelievably good.  Everything i've had was delicious, I randomly get cravings for their sushi. Service is always excellent, chefs are super friendly and ambiance is nice.  I love their funky playlist, whoever is choosing these tracks is amazing. Great tasting menu deal for $23. 50 incl tax.  Recommend coming here if you're craving sushi! A lot of the rolls are spicy salmon based with some variation.  The guys at the counter making sushi are a fun group that engages with the customers.  The tasting menu encompasses 3 courses: for starter, the salmon and tuna sashimi with Apple salad on top, second part of the course is what they call  "Christmas trees" which is piled on spicy salmon and lobster over a rice cracker (so so good!), and the third course is various sushi rolls which kind of all pretty similar in terms of taste (predominately spicy salmon or tuna based) with different complementary ingredients.  I thoroughly enjoyed the meal and the service! Would come back here again when I'm in Montreal. Was brought here by my trusted Yelp friend, Brian C and the place did not disappoint.  We got the tasting menu and I still can't believe how tasty it was and reasonably priced, it felt like that Ikea commercial where the woman buys a bunch of stuff and starts running out and yelling at her husband to "start the car!" The warm Michael Jackson roll was my fave, but all of the fish tasted so good and the rolls were all different enough to make me think that I was back in Vancouver eating close to the ocean and not deep in the heart of the Plateau. The staff here are all so much fun and laughed with us, gave us thorough explanations of everything and made us feel welcome.  Next time I go, I'll definitely sit at the bar because that looked like even more fun.  This place draws people of all ages and the presentation of the food somehow is so gorgeous despite how quickly they were able to get it prepared and onto our table. The only sorta bummer here is that they don't have a liquor licence and you can't bring your own, but hey, it keeps people moving in and out quickly, so you'll never have to wait long for a table.  Reservations are highly recommended as the space is fairly small. Food: the menu degustation is a good option for a first visit.  Its a 3 courses meal:1-Sashimi with apple, fresh in the mouth and the dressing is light and flavourful. 2-sapin de noel (salmon and shrimps tartar).  I like the crunchy and spicy of that dish. 3-mixed of makis chef's choice, alot of swag in the maki just like the names of them (Bob marley, MJ, etc) i like it!.  The sake reduction sauce is really good, a nice complement with the makis. Service: super friendly and quick!Ambiance: alot people, crowded place.  any sushi fan will like it. Conclusion: im coming back!The food was good and the visual was amazing, All french on the menu so was hard to understand, however the staff there was so kind helped and cared of us (Not only us she is just the best! haha).  If you want to try new sushi, I strongly recommend hereThis is definitely very unique.  Their sushi menu is quite interesting and stands out from many other sushi restaurants because they are creative.  I didn't like the creativity as much as I thought I would because I expected authentic Japanese when I visited. They definitely had some delicious rolls, but if you're looking for authentic sushi, this might not be the best place to go for that.  On the other hand, if you want to have sushi and you're not the biggest fan of raw fish, this might be better for you.  They have a tasting menu that's not on their menu, so make sure to ask your server about it if your'e interested - I had the tasting menu, and I think it's worth a try, because you get a lot more than ordering a la carte.  Overall, I had great service and I had a great dinner date with my husband.  Though it didn't have a lot of variety in their fish, it was a unique experience. I was very unimpressed.  With such high ratings, I was expecting a lot more.  I had the 1person prix fix which included salmon sashimi with Apple, two small bite called Christmas tree, and 2 rolls.  I enjoyed the Christmas tree small bites but it was again repeated in my rolls.  A little overkill.  It's delicious because I think they mixed in ritz crackers crumbles in the lobster slaw.  Just a guess! Very Hawaiian style sushi dining which is good but maybe not what I was looking for. Overall, this is my favorite sushi place and I would recommend it to everyone.  However, I do have a story related to what makes this place special. Alright! Here's the story. It was the third time I had been to this place.  The moment I walked through the door, I was greeted by the gentleman who served me the previous time I was there, which was a month ago. As I was assigned my seat, he says "Hey, ça va?" as if we knew each other already.  I was caught off guard.  To my amazement, I realized that he remembered me.  He pointed to the exact spot, to the left near the bar, which my date and I were seated last time.  At that moment, it felt special for me.  It made me feel valued as a customer. I finally realized what made this place amongst the top rated restaurants on Yelp.  Of course, we can go on and on about the food and decor.  In the end, there's one element that the staff adds to this place which makes it wonderful, the personal touch.  It's a laid back environment with great service and even greater people.  They're basically your friends who happen to serve you food!*Even if you have allergies, they will make the adjustments necessary to assure you have a great experience. As for the food, when you open the menu, you don't get overwhelmed with all the items.  They provide a good variety, without having the complication of your table coming up with a whole system to what food item every person wants. For the people who want to keep it simple in the decision making, you can go for the "Tasting Menu," where you get to taste all their different types of sushi and see what Saint Sushi Bar is all about.  Simply put, this is where you flood your taste buds with euphoria.  All at an affordable price of $22 per person!Take a look at all the photos.  Once you're done salivating, go check this place out.

On the other hand, if you want to have sushi and you're not the biggest fan of raw fish, this might be better for you.  They have a tasting menu that's not on their menu, so make sure to ask your server about it if your'e interested - I had the tasting menu, and I think it's worth a try, because you get a lot more than ordering a la carte.  Overall, I had great service and I had a great dinner date with my husband.  Though it didn't have a lot of variety in their fish, it was a unique experience. I was very unimpressed.  With such high ratings, I was expecting a lot more.  I had the 1person prix fix which included salmon sashimi with Apple, two small bite called Christmas tree, and 2 rolls.  I enjoyed the Christmas tree small bites but it was again repeated in my rolls.  A little overkill.  It's delicious because I think they mixed in ritz crackers crumbles in the lobster slaw.  Just a guess! Very Hawaiian style sushi dining which is good but maybe not what I was looking for. Overall, this is my favorite sushi place and I would recommend it to everyone.  However, I do have a story related to what makes this place special. Alright! Here's the story. It was the third time I had been to this place.  The moment I walked through the door, I was greeted by the gentleman who served me the previous time I was there, which was a month ago. As I was assigned my seat, he says "Hey, ça va?" as if we knew each other already.  I was caught off guard.  To my amazement, I realized that he remembered me.  He pointed to the exact spot, to the left near the bar, which my date and I were seated last time.  At that moment, it felt special for me.  It made me feel valued as a customer. I finally realized what made this place amongst the top rated restaurants on Yelp.  Of course, we can go on and on about the food and decor.  In the end, there's one element that the staff adds to this place which makes it wonderful, the personal touch.  It's a laid back environment with great service and even greater people.  They're basically your friends who happen to serve you food!*Even if you have allergies, they will make the adjustments necessary to assure you have a great experience. As for the food, when you open the menu, you don't get overwhelmed with all the items.  They provide a good variety, without having the complication of your table coming up with a whole system to what food item every person wants. For the people who want to keep it simple in the decision making, you can go for the "Tasting Menu," where you get to taste all their different types of sushi and see what Saint Sushi Bar is all about.  Simply put, this is where you flood your taste buds with euphoria.  All at an affordable price of $22 per person!Take a look at all the photos.  Once you're done salivating, go check this place out.  Have fun!Best sushi place I've been.  Music is awesome, very chill R&B music playing and just a fun hipster atmosphere, come here,  you'll love it!Location: Tucked away on Duluth, just off of St.  Denis (head east).  The closest subway is Mont-Royal or you can try your luck with street parking. The place: Teeny tiny, but it's got BIG energy.  The space is nothing fancy but it offers up a chill, comfortable vibe.  The guys who run this place also have excellent taste in music so you don't need to worry about having to listen to elevator music or that pop crap.  The goods: Honestly, I could write a short novel about how goddamn good the sushi is here, but I won't.  All you need to know is that SS serves up top notch cuisine using quality ingredients and everything is made upon order.  I tried the tasting menu that included such goodies as the Bob Marley, the Beatles, the Madonna and the Michael Jackson, among others.  The starter was salmon sashimi in a sake reduction.  Jesus, it was good.  Our second dish was the 'Christmas tree' - a lovely concoction of seafood served on a rice cracker.  Our waiter Ali (hope I spelled that right!), told me the present wasn't on the bottom but rather, on the top - and he was right.  It was so incredibly flavourful that I could feast on this alone.  The grand finale was a beautiful sushi platter and every item on it rocked.  Hello - can I move in?Service: Phenomenal.  Ali, Saeng, Ralph and our host whose name I unfortunately didn't get, were amazing.  You can't ask for friendlier people to accompany a wonderful meal.  I had a great chat with the guys and they let me know that they were basically a group of childhood friends who decided to work together.  They really seem to love what they do and it's obvious that they mesh well.  A huge white gangsta shout-out to these fine gents. Price point: Super affordable - the tasting menu is $22 tax in, per person.  So. . .  What are you waiting for? Go! But be warned - you'll need a reservation on weekends.  This place is too cool for school. Honestly, I've been to a couple of sushi places, but this is the spot!The atmosphere is great and the food is even better.   Make a reservation and try to sit at the bar and get to know the artist that creat your dishes.  The food is as wonderful as they are.  Go NOW!!This is a great sushi place - the quality of everything on the menu is top notch.  Every roll and dish has new, interesting and diverse flavour combinations and everything tastes incredibly fresh.  I ordered the tasting menu, which costs about $25. 00 and included three courses: one small sashimi plate, two "Christmas Trees" (lobster on a cracker; it's delicious), and a final sushi/maki plate with a selection of whatever the chef decides to put on it that night.  Every single item was tasty as hell.  The service was excellent too, our waiter was friendly and explained all of the dishes to us nicely.  The only reason I didn't give a 5 star review of this place is that I was left a little hungry upon leaving.  This isn't necessarily a problem, the food was amazing and I'm sure about 70% of people don't need anything more, but for $25. 00, even two or three more rolls would've gone a long way to leaving me satisfied. Overall, brilliant place.  Best sushi I've had in Montreal. I admit this place is quite unique, but way way overpriced.  We ordered the tasting menu, and for something like $25/ person, we were extremely unsatisfied after finishing the meal.  All three of us were hungry after finishing the three-course tasting menu.  The first course was some salmon and tuna sashimi with green apple slices and a sake based sauce.  These tiny thin cut slices were delicious, but only included a tiny taste of each (2 slices of super thin fish/ person).  Then came the christmas trees.  These were alright, but there seemed to be a trend from this dish onwards with an overuse of mayo that kinda dulled the natural flavours of the seafood.  The presentation, however, was unique and well-crafted.  Next, was the 6 "rolls" that came out.  And I put the rolls in quotation marks because they really just give you parts of a roll and expect that to be enough.  Two rolls were put into rice paper rather than nori, which gave it an interesting texture, and were probably the best ones on the plate.  One roll was wrapped in cucumber and was fairly tasteless and underwhelming.  The deep fried roll tasted like oil and wasn't very good at all.  Again, in the rolls, mayo was overused and masked the natural flavours of fish.  The restaurant had a really cool vibe and was really quite busy.  Service was good.  The food was interesting, but overpriced.  I literally could have ordered a single roll at a different sushi restaurant and have been more full and paid less than I did with this tasting menu.  I would not come here again.  If it weren't for the nice little restaurant setting and the good service, I'd be giving this place a 2/5. Again, theory is confirmed, the best seat in any restaurant is at the bar.  That's where the action is at!At Saint Sushi you will not be disappointed by owner Saeng who is always having a great time, pounding out his creation one after the next.  My friend and I were enjoying his humming, singing and dancing along classic hits such as "Kiss on my List" by Hall & Oates and "Hypnotize" by the one and only Notorious B. I. G. Inside is a surreal restaurant, with a fantastic atmosphere and eclectically decorated with Laotian traditional paintings & statues, but you'll also find an Alice in Wonderland's Rabbit pendant clock, an elephant sporting a NY Yankees baseball hat, various shaped lamps and so many more items that don't quite fit together but somehow make sense here!The menu contains an assortment of options.  We went for the tasting menu which was surprisingly affordable! My favorites so far was the Christmas Tree, a conifer-like mounted mixture of lobster, tobiko, masago, scallions and bits of tempura I believe.  Close second is the Beatles which is a lobster maki encased in a cucumber sheet with enoki mushrooms topped with Tuna and Salmon sashimi.  The joyfully named maki rolls were actually inspired from artists that owner Saeng grew up with: Bob Marley, Madonna, Marvin Gaye, Michael Jackson, Tupac and many more - take the time to ask why and you'll chuckle. When asked about the restaurant name, Saeng mentioned that he used to love visiting many cities outside Montreal, that always seemed to the start with 'St-Something'. . .  hence Saint Sushi was born (St-Montreal didn't quite sound right)!The only drawbacks of this place is that they do not have a liquor license, which is not a bad thing as you can focus on the food. . .  and the wait time, even when you have a reservation; which is also kinda ok in case you arrive late.  Otherwise, if your are in for an unconventional sushi stop, then you've found it!Read good reviews about this place so decided to give it a try. Decor is pretty cool with lots of thai influence.  We had no reservation so had to sit at the sushi bar which was fine with me because I like watching the chefs roll their sushi. My friend and I ordered 2 miso soup and the combo called Cycle which included 10 pieces of maki, 4 pièces of sushi, 2 pieces of the Christmas tree and sashimi. First came the miso soup. . . oh god it was salty!!!. . . barely took 2 sips.  When we told the waiter, he said he would not charge us for them. . . ok. As for the sushi, definitely cannot be called authentic.  There is a lot of fruits used in the roll. . . which kind of masked the taste of the fish in the sushi rolls.  Sushi in Japan is all about the fish. . . keeping everything simple so thay you can taste the freshness of the fish.  It was good sushi but not something I would call authentic.  You know it is fusion sushi when you see non japanese/Asian making sushi :pAlthough not the best I have tried but for the price, it is a pretty good bang for your buck.  The service was also pretty good.  I would go back for some affordable sushi and the sushi chef was very funny and made this experience a lot more fun. If you've ever been to Tri Express and loved it, but found that the seating situation was less than ideal, than this is the place for you.  I think the chef here used to work for Tri because the flavour profile is almost identical.  That special flavour they put in very roll that you just can't wrap your taste buds around (unami maybe?) is found in all the sushi's here as well.  They also have that yummy tartar topped on a cracker found at Tri that goes by the name 'Christmas tree'Super affordable and set in a larger space with tables of decent size, it's a very nice place to enjoy a weekday sushi outing. Get the chefs tasting menu (23. 50$), you won't be disappointed.  Only downside is that, like Tri, they don't have an alcohol permit so you can't pair a good sake with the delicious sushi. The decor of Saint Sushi Bar doesn't follow your typical Japanese restaurant.  Really, I thought that I was in some sort of Indo-Thai restaurant.  But just as unconventional as the decor was, the menu was amazing.  Named after pop culture's famous icons, each sushi roll was as unique as the people it represented.  No, you won't just taste a massive whiff of spicy mayo in each but you'll actually get to taste intriguing combinations of flavors.  Which is why the tasting platter is an excellent choice.  Don't worry, there are traditional sushi in the menu but the "celebrity" ones are must tries.  On top of excellent creative sushi, the staffs were extremely down to earth.  My jokes were replied with more jokes coming from the waitress, one of the chefs kept telling us across two tables to not hesitate if we had any questions, another member showed serious concerns about my friend's broken finger which was wrapped in a cast and wished for her well-being.  It felt as if we were welcomed not as clients but as professional friends. Saint Sushi Bar really deserves a top spot on Yelp.  Do yourself a favor and add this place to your food bucket list. Had an a-ok lunch here today.  Shared a few rolls with a friend and they were all tasty.   Considering that the avocado in my rolls were brown and dotted black, and that all the rolls looked like they were slapped together by an amateur, I'd have to say presentation was lacking.  For how much it cost, I'd say it's pretty average.  All in all a tasty experience, probably aided by the use of tons of mayo in their rolls. I'm usually really picky with my sushi.  I always have certain types of them I order, for instance like the California role.  So once I went here, I saw the menu, and they dont have a lot of options from the usual ones, so I was sure I wouldnt like this place. But we decided to order the chef's choice and a few classic ones just in case.  The food came and OMG it was so good! My favorite was the one called "Christmas Tree", its almost only samon but I loved it.  I'd come back here again for sure. P. S.  its better if you have a reservation there, as the place is small, and we had to wait a bit since we didn't have a reservationWe had a great time at Saint Sushi.  The tasting menu was really delicious.  Make a reservation to save yourself any grief.  The michael jackson roll was very good.  The Christmas Tree was good too.  The staff is very friendly and lots of fun.   Overall, a nice place to enjoy some fusion Sushi. If you are in Montreal, pass by and check it out.  You wont be disappointed. Hands down my favorite sushi place in Montreal.  The price/quality ratio is unbeatable. I like how they put the focus on the quality of the fish instead of using rice as a filler like many places do.  You MUST try the " christmas tree " it's unbelievably good.  Everything i've had was delicious, I randomly get cravings for their sushi. Service is always excellent, chefs are super friendly and ambiance is nice.  I love their funky playlist, whoever is choosing these tracks is amazing. Great tasting menu deal for $23. 50 incl tax.  Recommend coming here if you're craving sushi! A lot of the rolls are spicy salmon based with some variation.  The guys at the counter making sushi are a fun group that engages with the customers.  The tasting menu encompasses 3 courses: for starter, the salmon and tuna sashimi with Apple salad on top, second part of the course is what they call  "Christmas trees" which is piled on spicy salmon and lobster over a rice cracker (so so good!), and the third course is various sushi rolls which kind of all pretty similar in terms of taste (predominately spicy salmon or tuna based) with different complementary ingredients.  I thoroughly enjoyed the meal and the service! Would come back here again when I'm in Montreal. Was brought here by my trusted Yelp friend, Brian C and the place did not disappoint.  We got the tasting menu and I still can't believe how tasty it was and reasonably priced, it felt like that Ikea commercial where the woman buys a bunch of stuff and starts running out and yelling at her husband to "start the car!" The warm Michael Jackson roll was my fave, but all of the fish tasted so good and the rolls were all different enough to make me think that I was back in Vancouver eating close to the ocean and not deep in the heart of the Plateau. The staff here are all so much fun and laughed with us, gave us thorough explanations of everything and made us feel welcome.  Next time I go, I'll definitely sit at the bar because that looked like even more fun.  This place draws people of all ages and the presentation of the food somehow is so gorgeous despite how quickly they were able to get it prepared and onto our table. The only sorta bummer here is that they don't have a liquor licence and you can't bring your own, but hey, it keeps people moving in and out quickly, so you'll never have to wait long for a table.  Reservations are highly recommended as the space is fairly small. Food: the menu degustation is a good option for a first visit.  Its a 3 courses meal:1-Sashimi with apple, fresh in the mouth and the dressing is light and flavourful. 2-sapin de noel (salmon and shrimps tartar).  I like the crunchy and spicy of that dish. 3-mixed of makis chef's choice, alot of swag in the maki just like the names of them (Bob marley, MJ, etc) i like it!.  The sake reduction sauce is really good, a nice complement with the makis. Service: super friendly and quick!Ambiance: alot people, crowded place.  any sushi fan will like it. Conclusion: im coming back!The food was good and the visual was amazing, All french on the menu so was hard to understand, however the staff there was so kind helped and cared of us (Not only us she is just the best! haha).  If you want to try new sushi, I strongly recommend hereThis is definitely very unique.  Their sushi menu is quite interesting and stands out from many other sushi restaurants because they are creative.  I didn't like the creativity as much as I thought I would because I expected authentic Japanese when I visited. They definitely had some delicious rolls, but if you're looking for authentic sushi, this might not be the best place to go for that.  On the other hand, if you want to have sushi and you're not the biggest fan of raw fish, this might be better for you.  They have a tasting menu that's not on their menu, so make sure to ask your server about it if your'e interested - I had the tasting menu, and I think it's worth a try, because you get a lot more than ordering a la carte.  Overall, I had great service and I had a great dinner date with my husband.  Though it didn't have a lot of variety in their fish, it was a unique experience. I was very unimpressed.  With such high ratings, I was expecting a lot more.  I had the 1person prix fix which included salmon sashimi with Apple, two small bite called Christmas tree, and 2 rolls.  I enjoyed the Christmas tree small bites but it was again repeated in my rolls.  A little overkill.  It's delicious because I think they mixed in ritz crackers crumbles in the lobster slaw.  Just a guess! Very Hawaiian style sushi dining which is good but maybe not what I was looking for. Overall, this is my favorite sushi place and I would recommend it to everyone.  However, I do have a story related to what makes this place special. Alright! Here's the story. It was the third time I had been to this place.

The tasting menu encompasses 3 courses: for starter, the salmon and tuna sashimi with Apple salad on top, second part of the course is what they call  "Christmas trees" which is piled on spicy salmon and lobster over a rice cracker (so so good!), and the third course is various sushi rolls which kind of all pretty similar in terms of taste (predominately spicy salmon or tuna based) with different complementary ingredients.  I thoroughly enjoyed the meal and the service! Would come back here again when I'm in Montreal. Was brought here by my trusted Yelp friend, Brian C and the place did not disappoint.  We got the tasting menu and I still can't believe how tasty it was and reasonably priced, it felt like that Ikea commercial where the woman buys a bunch of stuff and starts running out and yelling at her husband to "start the car!" The warm Michael Jackson roll was my fave, but all of the fish tasted so good and the rolls were all different enough to make me think that I was back in Vancouver eating close to the ocean and not deep in the heart of the Plateau. The staff here are all so much fun and laughed with us, gave us thorough explanations of everything and made us feel welcome.  Next time I go, I'll definitely sit at the bar because that looked like even more fun.  This place draws people of all ages and the presentation of the food somehow is so gorgeous despite how quickly they were able to get it prepared and onto our table. The only sorta bummer here is that they don't have a liquor licence and you can't bring your own, but hey, it keeps people moving in and out quickly, so you'll never have to wait long for a table.  Reservations are highly recommended as the space is fairly small. Food: the menu degustation is a good option for a first visit.  Its a 3 courses meal:1-Sashimi with apple, fresh in the mouth and the dressing is light and flavourful. 2-sapin de noel (salmon and shrimps tartar).  I like the crunchy and spicy of that dish. 3-mixed of makis chef's choice, alot of swag in the maki just like the names of them (Bob marley, MJ, etc) i like it!.  The sake reduction sauce is really good, a nice complement with the makis. Service: super friendly and quick!Ambiance: alot people, crowded place.  any sushi fan will like it. Conclusion: im coming back!The food was good and the visual was amazing, All french on the menu so was hard to understand, however the staff there was so kind helped and cared of us (Not only us she is just the best! haha).  If you want to try new sushi, I strongly recommend hereThis is definitely very unique.  Their sushi menu is quite interesting and stands out from many other sushi restaurants because they are creative.  I didn't like the creativity as much as I thought I would because I expected authentic Japanese when I visited. They definitely had some delicious rolls, but if you're looking for authentic sushi, this might not be the best place to go for that.  On the other hand, if you want to have sushi and you're not the biggest fan of raw fish, this might be better for you.  They have a tasting menu that's not on their menu, so make sure to ask your server about it if your'e interested - I had the tasting menu, and I think it's worth a try, because you get a lot more than ordering a la carte.  Overall, I had great service and I had a great dinner date with my husband.  Though it didn't have a lot of variety in their fish, it was a unique experience. I was very unimpressed.  With such high ratings, I was expecting a lot more.  I had the 1person prix fix which included salmon sashimi with Apple, two small bite called Christmas tree, and 2 rolls.  I enjoyed the Christmas tree small bites but it was again repeated in my rolls.  A little overkill.  It's delicious because I think they mixed in ritz crackers crumbles in the lobster slaw.  Just a guess! Very Hawaiian style sushi dining which is good but maybe not what I was looking for. Overall, this is my favorite sushi place and I would recommend it to everyone.  However, I do have a story related to what makes this place special. Alright! Here's the story. It was the third time I had been to this place.  The moment I walked through the door, I was greeted by the gentleman who served me the previous time I was there, which was a month ago. As I was assigned my seat, he says "Hey, ça va?" as if we knew each other already.  I was caught off guard.  To my amazement, I realized that he remembered me.  He pointed to the exact spot, to the left near the bar, which my date and I were seated last time.  At that moment, it felt special for me.  It made me feel valued as a customer. I finally realized what made this place amongst the top rated restaurants on Yelp.  Of course, we can go on and on about the food and decor.  In the end, there's one element that the staff adds to this place which makes it wonderful, the personal touch.  It's a laid back environment with great service and even greater people.  They're basically your friends who happen to serve you food!*Even if you have allergies, they will make the adjustments necessary to assure you have a great experience. As for the food, when you open the menu, you don't get overwhelmed with all the items.  They provide a good variety, without having the complication of your table coming up with a whole system to what food item every person wants. For the people who want to keep it simple in the decision making, you can go for the "Tasting Menu," where you get to taste all their different types of sushi and see what Saint Sushi Bar is all about.  Simply put, this is where you flood your taste buds with euphoria.  All at an affordable price of $22 per person!Take a look at all the photos.  Once you're done salivating, go check this place out.  Have fun!Best sushi place I've been.  Music is awesome, very chill R&B music playing and just a fun hipster atmosphere, come here,  you'll love it!Location: Tucked away on Duluth, just off of St.  Denis (head east).  The closest subway is Mont-Royal or you can try your luck with street parking. The place: Teeny tiny, but it's got BIG energy.  The space is nothing fancy but it offers up a chill, comfortable vibe.  The guys who run this place also have excellent taste in music so you don't need to worry about having to listen to elevator music or that pop crap.  The goods: Honestly, I could write a short novel about how goddamn good the sushi is here, but I won't.  All you need to know is that SS serves up top notch cuisine using quality ingredients and everything is made upon order.  I tried the tasting menu that included such goodies as the Bob Marley, the Beatles, the Madonna and the Michael Jackson, among others.  The starter was salmon sashimi in a sake reduction.  Jesus, it was good.  Our second dish was the 'Christmas tree' - a lovely concoction of seafood served on a rice cracker.  Our waiter Ali (hope I spelled that right!), told me the present wasn't on the bottom but rather, on the top - and he was right.  It was so incredibly flavourful that I could feast on this alone.  The grand finale was a beautiful sushi platter and every item on it rocked.  Hello - can I move in?Service: Phenomenal.  Ali, Saeng, Ralph and our host whose name I unfortunately didn't get, were amazing.  You can't ask for friendlier people to accompany a wonderful meal.  I had a great chat with the guys and they let me know that they were basically a group of childhood friends who decided to work together.  They really seem to love what they do and it's obvious that they mesh well.  A huge white gangsta shout-out to these fine gents. Price point: Super affordable - the tasting menu is $22 tax in, per person.  So. . .  What are you waiting for? Go! But be warned - you'll need a reservation on weekends.  This place is too cool for school. Honestly, I've been to a couple of sushi places, but this is the spot!The atmosphere is great and the food is even better.   Make a reservation and try to sit at the bar and get to know the artist that creat your dishes.  The food is as wonderful as they are.  Go NOW!!This is a great sushi place - the quality of everything on the menu is top notch.  Every roll and dish has new, interesting and diverse flavour combinations and everything tastes incredibly fresh.  I ordered the tasting menu, which costs about $25. 00 and included three courses: one small sashimi plate, two "Christmas Trees" (lobster on a cracker; it's delicious), and a final sushi/maki plate with a selection of whatever the chef decides to put on it that night.  Every single item was tasty as hell.  The service was excellent too, our waiter was friendly and explained all of the dishes to us nicely.  The only reason I didn't give a 5 star review of this place is that I was left a little hungry upon leaving.  This isn't necessarily a problem, the food was amazing and I'm sure about 70% of people don't need anything more, but for $25. 00, even two or three more rolls would've gone a long way to leaving me satisfied. Overall, brilliant place.  Best sushi I've had in Montreal. I admit this place is quite unique, but way way overpriced.  We ordered the tasting menu, and for something like $25/ person, we were extremely unsatisfied after finishing the meal.  All three of us were hungry after finishing the three-course tasting menu.  The first course was some salmon and tuna sashimi with green apple slices and a sake based sauce.  These tiny thin cut slices were delicious, but only included a tiny taste of each (2 slices of super thin fish/ person).  Then came the christmas trees.  These were alright, but there seemed to be a trend from this dish onwards with an overuse of mayo that kinda dulled the natural flavours of the seafood.  The presentation, however, was unique and well-crafted.  Next, was the 6 "rolls" that came out.  And I put the rolls in quotation marks because they really just give you parts of a roll and expect that to be enough.  Two rolls were put into rice paper rather than nori, which gave it an interesting texture, and were probably the best ones on the plate.  One roll was wrapped in cucumber and was fairly tasteless and underwhelming.  The deep fried roll tasted like oil and wasn't very good at all.  Again, in the rolls, mayo was overused and masked the natural flavours of fish.  The restaurant had a really cool vibe and was really quite busy.  Service was good.  The food was interesting, but overpriced.  I literally could have ordered a single roll at a different sushi restaurant and have been more full and paid less than I did with this tasting menu.  I would not come here again.  If it weren't for the nice little restaurant setting and the good service, I'd be giving this place a 2/5. Again, theory is confirmed, the best seat in any restaurant is at the bar.  That's where the action is at!At Saint Sushi you will not be disappointed by owner Saeng who is always having a great time, pounding out his creation one after the next.  My friend and I were enjoying his humming, singing and dancing along classic hits such as "Kiss on my List" by Hall & Oates and "Hypnotize" by the one and only Notorious B. I. G. Inside is a surreal restaurant, with a fantastic atmosphere and eclectically decorated with Laotian traditional paintings & statues, but you'll also find an Alice in Wonderland's Rabbit pendant clock, an elephant sporting a NY Yankees baseball hat, various shaped lamps and so many more items that don't quite fit together but somehow make sense here!The menu contains an assortment of options.  We went for the tasting menu which was surprisingly affordable! My favorites so far was the Christmas Tree, a conifer-like mounted mixture of lobster, tobiko, masago, scallions and bits of tempura I believe.  Close second is the Beatles which is a lobster maki encased in a cucumber sheet with enoki mushrooms topped with Tuna and Salmon sashimi.  The joyfully named maki rolls were actually inspired from artists that owner Saeng grew up with: Bob Marley, Madonna, Marvin Gaye, Michael Jackson, Tupac and many more - take the time to ask why and you'll chuckle. When asked about the restaurant name, Saeng mentioned that he used to love visiting many cities outside Montreal, that always seemed to the start with 'St-Something'. . .  hence Saint Sushi was born (St-Montreal didn't quite sound right)!The only drawbacks of this place is that they do not have a liquor license, which is not a bad thing as you can focus on the food. . .  and the wait time, even when you have a reservation; which is also kinda ok in case you arrive late.  Otherwise, if your are in for an unconventional sushi stop, then you've found it!Read good reviews about this place so decided to give it a try. Decor is pretty cool with lots of thai influence.  We had no reservation so had to sit at the sushi bar which was fine with me because I like watching the chefs roll their sushi. My friend and I ordered 2 miso soup and the combo called Cycle which included 10 pieces of maki, 4 pièces of sushi, 2 pieces of the Christmas tree and sashimi. First came the miso soup. . . oh god it was salty!!!. . . barely took 2 sips.  When we told the waiter, he said he would not charge us for them. . . ok. As for the sushi, definitely cannot be called authentic.  There is a lot of fruits used in the roll. . . which kind of masked the taste of the fish in the sushi rolls.  Sushi in Japan is all about the fish. . . keeping everything simple so thay you can taste the freshness of the fish.  It was good sushi but not something I would call authentic.  You know it is fusion sushi when you see non japanese/Asian making sushi :pAlthough not the best I have tried but for the price, it is a pretty good bang for your buck.  The service was also pretty good.  I would go back for some affordable sushi and the sushi chef was very funny and made this experience a lot more fun. If you've ever been to Tri Express and loved it, but found that the seating situation was less than ideal, than this is the place for you.  I think the chef here used to work for Tri because the flavour profile is almost identical.  That special flavour they put in very roll that you just can't wrap your taste buds around (unami maybe?) is found in all the sushi's here as well.  They also have that yummy tartar topped on a cracker found at Tri that goes by the name 'Christmas tree'Super affordable and set in a larger space with tables of decent size, it's a very nice place to enjoy a weekday sushi outing. Get the chefs tasting menu (23. 50$), you won't be disappointed.  Only downside is that, like Tri, they don't have an alcohol permit so you can't pair a good sake with the delicious sushi. The decor of Saint Sushi Bar doesn't follow your typical Japanese restaurant.  Really, I thought that I was in some sort of Indo-Thai restaurant.  But just as unconventional as the decor was, the menu was amazing.  Named after pop culture's famous icons, each sushi roll was as unique as the people it represented.  No, you won't just taste a massive whiff of spicy mayo in each but you'll actually get to taste intriguing combinations of flavors.  Which is why the tasting platter is an excellent choice.  Don't worry, there are traditional sushi in the menu but the "celebrity" ones are must tries.  On top of excellent creative sushi, the staffs were extremely down to earth.  My jokes were replied with more jokes coming from the waitress, one of the chefs kept telling us across two tables to not hesitate if we had any questions, another member showed serious concerns about my friend's broken finger which was wrapped in a cast and wished for her well-being.  It felt as if we were welcomed not as clients but as professional friends. Saint Sushi Bar really deserves a top spot on Yelp.  Do yourself a favor and add this place to your food bucket list. Had an a-ok lunch here today.  Shared a few rolls with a friend and they were all tasty.   Considering that the avocado in my rolls were brown and dotted black, and that all the rolls looked like they were slapped together by an amateur, I'd have to say presentation was lacking.  For how much it cost, I'd say it's pretty average.  All in all a tasty experience, probably aided by the use of tons of mayo in their rolls. I'm usually really picky with my sushi.  I always have certain types of them I order, for instance like the California role.  So once I went here, I saw the menu, and they dont have a lot of options from the usual ones, so I was sure I wouldnt like this place. But we decided to order the chef's choice and a few classic ones just in case.  The food came and OMG it was so good! My favorite was the one called "Christmas Tree", its almost only samon but I loved it.  I'd come back here again for sure. P. S.  its better if you have a reservation there, as the place is small, and we had to wait a bit since we didn't have a reservationWe had a great time at Saint Sushi.  The tasting menu was really delicious.  Make a reservation to save yourself any grief.  The michael jackson roll was very good.  The Christmas Tree was good too.  The staff is very friendly and lots of fun.   Overall, a nice place to enjoy some fusion Sushi. If you are in Montreal, pass by and check it out.  You wont be disappointed. Hands down my favorite sushi place in Montreal.  The price/quality ratio is unbeatable. I like how they put the focus on the quality of the fish instead of using rice as a filler like many places do.  You MUST try the " christmas tree " it's unbelievably good.  Everything i've had was delicious, I randomly get cravings for their sushi. Service is always excellent, chefs are super friendly and ambiance is nice.  I love their funky playlist, whoever is choosing these tracks is amazing. Great tasting menu deal for $23. 50 incl tax.  Recommend coming here if you're craving sushi!

I thoroughly enjoyed the meal and the service! Would come back here again when I'm in Montreal. Was brought here by my trusted Yelp friend, Brian C and the place did not disappoint.  We got the tasting menu and I still can't believe how tasty it was and reasonably priced, it felt like that Ikea commercial where the woman buys a bunch of stuff and starts running out and yelling at her husband to "start the car!" The warm Michael Jackson roll was my fave, but all of the fish tasted so good and the rolls were all different enough to make me think that I was back in Vancouver eating close to the ocean and not deep in the heart of the Plateau. The staff here are all so much fun and laughed with us, gave us thorough explanations of everything and made us feel welcome.  Next time I go, I'll definitely sit at the bar because that looked like even more fun.
