TREAT YO SELF.  This place is worth the AMAZING food.  I was in Montreal for a total of 24 hrs & this place was recommended to me by a friend.  I do not speak French.  At.  All.  The waiter was so patient with me & did his best to explain the specials of the day.  He ended up just simplifying the day's soup to "chicken noodle soup" & also recommended one of the sandwiches.  I felt so bad after.  The soup was amazinggggg it did not deserve to be simplified to a mere chicken noodle soup & for that I'm so sorry.  It was so good.  The sandwich was such a large portion & so great, I had half & saved the other half for later.  It's also located in old Montreal, which is such a great place to walk around & take in the old architecture.  Completely recommend!!I absolutely love this place.  I was there years ago but still remember how quaint and cozy and warming this place was.  The service was super friendly and the food was on par.  I'm planning on going back next year and this is my first stop when I go back. This place came highly recommended to me.  I was visiting Montreal for the first time, and I was told that this cafe had the best coffee and baked goods.  There was an off-hand mention of the "beautiful but ill-tempered" employees but I glossed over it.  MISTAKE. We arrived and were seated promptly.  Upon attempting to order, we discovered they were out of nearly everything we wanted.  It was around 11am, and they told us they were out of coffee and the first two sandwiches I tried to order.  I work as a waitress in a restaurant.  I understand that it is not the fault of the waiters that items run out.  However, the rude, irritated attitude of the waiter was uncalled for.  If your menu is only 10-12 items long and 2 of them are sold out, you should tell people before they survey the menu.  Or apologize for the inconvenience.  I tried to order a third sandwich modified without mushroom, which I was told was not possible.  I ended up ordering the vegan sandwich. The sandwich was excellent. That being said, the overall experience was so poor that I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  There are plenty of other restaurants in Montreal with exceptional food and good service. Popped in toward the end of their brunch and it was still pretty crowded, but we managed to snag a table for two by one of their cute little windows. The space is great.  Chalkboards with doodles and menu items cover the walls and the cute cafe by the entrance has some goodies for sale.  The space gets crowded quick but it's a lively atmosphere.  In the summer, there's no AC but thank the heavens this is a corner location and the open air windows let in a slight breeze. Once seated, our server informed us a lot of the menu items are done for the day since its the end of brunch but the options left sounded just as delightful.  I had the mixed salad with chicken and my boyfriend had the Cuban sandwich.  Both were SPECTACULAR.  Although it was a different take on a classic, this was probably the best Cuban I've ever tried.  The pesto mayo made this dish! The mixed salad sounds so simple but it was SO good, the toasted almonds and the chopped chicken gave this salad the kick it didn't even need.  I loved how light but tasty the dressing was.  I wanted to come back the next day to have the same meal again, even though I don't like visiting the same restaurant twice while on vacation.  It was that good. This place isn't overrated or as pretentious as it sounds or looks - go check it out!Looking for a good cup of coffee and pastry, my doorman recommended this place - and he was right, it is fantastic! The place is small and every table was full with a wait.  I just grabbed a late and croissant to go.  The late was made perfectly.  Oh, and the croissant. . . oh la la! It did remind me of Paris. I think I definitely worked this place up in my head by reading all the reviews and then was a bit disappointed.  Don't get me wrong the food is good and the quality of the ingredients is great.  But is it worth the price, the wait and sitting shoulder to shoulder cramped with other guests. . . probably not.  I've been here twice.  Once for take out and once for a sit down meal.  For take out I ordered the banana chocolate brioche and a cappuccino.  It was good.  The pastry was delicious.  However I think the tiny cappuccinos are quite overpriced and nothing special.  For the sit down meal I got there at 10:40 am and it wasn't too busy.  I tried to order the 'in your face egg panini' which they were sold out of.  How do you sell out of eggs and bread at a breakfast place by 10:40? It wasn't a big deal, but it made a difference since their menu is already very small and limited.  I also noticed it's a trend in the other reviews.  Anyways I ordered the ricotta with honey and bread and an almond croissant.  Both were delicious.  The ricotta is creamy and refreshing.  The almond croissant is good but overpriced in my opinion.  I do have to say that the service there was lovely.  Everything was delivered quickly and with a smile.  However overall I think this place is a bit overrated.  Would I go here for lunch once in a while if I worked nearby, sure.  Would I go out of my way to come here? Probably not.  There are so many other cafes in this area with incredible cappuccinos and pastries at almost half the cost and half the crowds. The best cuban sandwich in Montreal according to me.  And the best in North America, according to Anthony Bourdain. In fact, all sandwiches are pretty awesome.  But how to resist O+G's sandwich filled with gooey gruyère, ham, pork loin and their secret sauce? Feeling a bit more healthy? The "24" salad with asian flavors is a good choice too. And how to resist their beautiful selection of baked desserts?Did I say how I love O+G ? Try it, you won't be disappointed. This place gets 5 stars from me, at least from the breakfast standpoint.  We came here because it was a highly recommended spot located in Old Montreal, and we wanted to try it out.  For breakfast I had a coffee, and the granola.  The granola is amazing it comes with yoghurt and a bunch of different types of fruit.  It was delicious.  I also had a chocolate and banana pastry which was super yummy as well. This place is very busy but we were seated and served pretty quickly.  I really liked this place and would totally come here again. Came here on Saturday for lunch around 12pm.  The host told us it would be a 25-30 minute wait, but when we came back around 12:30pm, he told us another 25 minutes, so that was pretty annoying that the estimated timing was wayyy off, but we got coffee at a nearby café so that was fine.  They also serve coffee and pastries in the takeout line, so that's nice to have while you wait. The place itself is very cozy and cute.  We sat on a communal table and I ordered a Goat Cheese and Onion Panini and a raspberry lemonade.  The Panini came with a homemade ketchup which was thinned out ketchup that was sweet but still tangy - it complemented the sandwich perfectly.  I couldn't finish the whole Panini by myself.  My friends ordered the Cuban sandwich and the Cajun Chicken Sandwich, which they all enjoyed.  Great to share the Paninis with friends for some variation in your overall meal.  I was sad to hear that they ran out of the egg in your face Panini -- I really wanted to try that!The service was pretty quick as all the sandwiches were premade, which I thought it was odd, considering sandwiches are pretty quick to make, but I was happy with our overall meal. Located in Old Montreal but was a really good restaurant!! I came there twice because the Cuba panini was only on lunch menu.  It deserves visiting again. My friend and I had two divine brioches for breakfast.  My chocolate and banana one was the best of the world! Too much chocolate inside! Not too sweet but very crispy.  Soooo nice~ The Cuba panini was crunchy outside and gooey inside.  Melting cheese with bacon and salty turkey, never forgot.  Because it was the last meal in Montreal. The staff were all very pretty and friendly.  Love the ambience and decoration of the restaurant.  The price was reasonable. From the ratings to the many reviews on here, it's as good as it gets so I won't repeat the others, but a few of my own tips and observations:Let me preface that I was just visiting Montreal for the weekend, first time in the city. I came here essentially to get that Eggs In Yo Face (I'm sure you know what I mean) breakfast sandwich.   Note: The place currently opens at 9 am (on Saturdays).   From reading blogs, it suggested we get there at 8:30, we arrived at 8:40 to a closed restaurant.  We walked around and came back at 9:04 and already there was a line.  Luckily we managed to snag some seats at the high table though so definitely come early, this place is as popular as they say! I asked if I could get the sandwich without cheese - DENIED.   Said the cheese was already pre-mixed into the eggs.   I decided to chance it.  I've hated cheese my entire life, I've become quite adept at picking out cheese from food.   And glad I did, because all I had to do was open the sandwich and not eat the side on which the cheese was melted.  The rest was delicious and cheese free (uhm. . . but this also means the cheese could have easily been left out but. . . . whatever).   I asked for a knife and fork from a passing waitress (crucial tools in my cheese extraction). . . who reluctantly gave them to me with this request: "please be careful of the plates when  using the knife and fork, the plates scratch easily and can also break if you press too hard" - uhm.  really? I need to be careful of breaking plates. . . . . at a restaurant. . . . . with my utensils?  Sounds like someone bought some useless plates.  They were very pretty though. So why 5 stars for a place that refused me to go cheeseless and warns you of heavy utensil use? Cuz the food is delicious! Really, go and get the sandwich.  I miss it already.  Also the vibe is great.  Lovely cozy spot perfect for breakfast to fuel you up for a day of sightseeing.  Also, our main server (male) was great, super nice and friendly and overall we had a great meal.  Approx $70 Canadian (including tip) for 2 sandwiches, 1 fruit bowl, 1 pastry, 2 coffees and 2 very fresh squeezed orange juice for a party of 3. Olive & Gourmando is located in Old Montreal on Saint Paul.  It is just a couple of blocks off of the river near the old port. As other yelpers have written the place does a brisk business, mainly with the tourist trade.  However, Olive & Gourmand is a pretty good place for fresh baked goods, good coffee and an excellent brunch.  We had about a 20-minute wait for our table for 3. The food we had was all very fresh and had nice flavors.  I had the Goat Cheese Sandwich (Mild goat cheese paillot and caramelized onions.  Served with their house made ketchup) and it was excellent.  We also had coffee and some really special baked goods. The prices are not too bad either being in the heart of the tourist district.  Our server was really nice also. Every time I set foot in here for breakfast (or lunch), I'm always pleased with the food quality, the excellent & friend service and the eclectic and welcoming decor!You'll often hear patrons of Olive & Gourmand complimenting them on the "concept". . .  interesting because when you ask veteran Marie-Helene and Sandra, or "old crusts" as they jokingly call themselves, there is no concept.  It's just the result  of a slow evolution of bringing goodness and joy to people, season after season. The hustle and bustle can perhaps turn off some people who prefer quietness when sipping their café but if you're like me and love the vibe, the energy, the possibility of striking serendipitous conversations with locals or out-of-towners, and the soothing humming of the hustle & bustle this iconic place delivers then you're in for happy times!Whether you're vegan, vegetarian, or a carnivore (me), Olive & Gourmando redefines what wholesome, homemade food should be. What a beautiful, cozy place! The food is delicious; the salads and sandwiches are always my choice and the pastry are just perfect for my usual cappuccino! I love the vibe of the place; the moment you take your seat at the table, the day becomes better, surrounded with those beautiful smells of coffee and toasted bread and muffins :)The service is perfect, it always comes with a smile and with the answers and suggestions you need!The-best-place in Montreal for breakfast and brunch.  Oh wow, I still remember the taste of their numerous and beautiful pastries I tried with my boyfriend.  Flaky, buttery, fruity deliciousness in buns, croissants, danishes and donuts.  Everything was delicious and I wish I tried everything else.  Place was super busy when we got there so we grabbed food to go instead.  Get there early if you want to sit down or be prepare to wait. Outstanding bakery. Excellent for breakfast or lunch.   Salad and  sandwich listings are a bit limited, but you are bound to find something you like.   The baked products are some of the best I have tasted.   The lines can be long on the weekend. . . so get there expecting to wait. Service: Great, though we had to wait for about 20 min.  It was a Saturday afternoon around 4 pm.  This may be why it was so busy. Food: Really excellent.  My date had an excellent sandwich and my salad was delicious.  Everything was local and organic, always a plus in my book. Atmosphere: Really loud, but cool and trendy. Pricing: Slightly overpriced, but when you consider the quality of the ingredients, it may be the right price-point. I love how this place feels! Very cozy and hipster - you'll know what I mean.  The staff was very organized despite the place being very busy.  We were given a place all the way in the back corner of the shop and I was worried that we would be forgotten - we weren't.  If you ever wanted to try that increasingly popular 1642 Montreal Cola, then look no further.  I tried the grilled Cuban panini and it was good - crunchy and cheesy.  The habibi chicken, in my opinion, was better.  Anything tastes good with garlic, pickles, and dill.  Also there are vegetarian and vegan options if you're not a meat eater. If you're passing nearby the Old Port then you should definitely come by this place. Good, but pricey and a little strange.  We waited for about 45 minutes for a table for two, so obviously this place is popular.  You are packed in, basically sitting shoulder to shoulder with the person next to you.  We got fussed at for putting our jackets in the window sill (a little strange), so we had jackets piled on the backs of our chairs.  I ordered the Cuban, which was delicious, but pricey at over $10 without any sides.  I asked for a side of chips, and all they have are full size bags of chips made for multiple people. . .  So it became close to $20 for a sandwich and chips.  Like I said, the food was delicious, but it's pricey for what you get and you don't have much space. TREAT YO SELF.

This place isn't overrated or as pretentious as it sounds or looks - go check it out!Looking for a good cup of coffee and pastry, my doorman recommended this place - and he was right, it is fantastic! The place is small and every table was full with a wait.  I just grabbed a late and croissant to go.  The late was made perfectly.  Oh, and the croissant. . . oh la la! It did remind me of Paris. I think I definitely worked this place up in my head by reading all the reviews and then was a bit disappointed.  Don't get me wrong the food is good and the quality of the ingredients is great.  But is it worth the price, the wait and sitting shoulder to shoulder cramped with other guests. . . probably not.  I've been here twice.  Once for take out and once for a sit down meal.  For take out I ordered the banana chocolate brioche and a cappuccino.  It was good.  The pastry was delicious.  However I think the tiny cappuccinos are quite overpriced and nothing special.  For the sit down meal I got there at 10:40 am and it wasn't too busy.  I tried to order the 'in your face egg panini' which they were sold out of.  How do you sell out of eggs and bread at a breakfast place by 10:40? It wasn't a big deal, but it made a difference since their menu is already very small and limited.  I also noticed it's a trend in the other reviews.  Anyways I ordered the ricotta with honey and bread and an almond croissant.  Both were delicious.  The ricotta is creamy and refreshing.  The almond croissant is good but overpriced in my opinion.  I do have to say that the service there was lovely.  Everything was delivered quickly and with a smile.  However overall I think this place is a bit overrated.  Would I go here for lunch once in a while if I worked nearby, sure.  Would I go out of my way to come here? Probably not.  There are so many other cafes in this area with incredible cappuccinos and pastries at almost half the cost and half the crowds. The best cuban sandwich in Montreal according to me.  And the best in North America, according to Anthony Bourdain. In fact, all sandwiches are pretty awesome.  But how to resist O+G's sandwich filled with gooey gruyère, ham, pork loin and their secret sauce? Feeling a bit more healthy? The "24" salad with asian flavors is a good choice too. And how to resist their beautiful selection of baked desserts?Did I say how I love O+G ? Try it, you won't be disappointed. This place gets 5 stars from me, at least from the breakfast standpoint.  We came here because it was a highly recommended spot located in Old Montreal, and we wanted to try it out.  For breakfast I had a coffee, and the granola.  The granola is amazing it comes with yoghurt and a bunch of different types of fruit.  It was delicious.  I also had a chocolate and banana pastry which was super yummy as well. This place is very busy but we were seated and served pretty quickly.  I really liked this place and would totally come here again. Came here on Saturday for lunch around 12pm.  The host told us it would be a 25-30 minute wait, but when we came back around 12:30pm, he told us another 25 minutes, so that was pretty annoying that the estimated timing was wayyy off, but we got coffee at a nearby café so that was fine.  They also serve coffee and pastries in the takeout line, so that's nice to have while you wait. The place itself is very cozy and cute.  We sat on a communal table and I ordered a Goat Cheese and Onion Panini and a raspberry lemonade.  The Panini came with a homemade ketchup which was thinned out ketchup that was sweet but still tangy - it complemented the sandwich perfectly.  I couldn't finish the whole Panini by myself.  My friends ordered the Cuban sandwich and the Cajun Chicken Sandwich, which they all enjoyed.  Great to share the Paninis with friends for some variation in your overall meal.  I was sad to hear that they ran out of the egg in your face Panini -- I really wanted to try that!The service was pretty quick as all the sandwiches were premade, which I thought it was odd, considering sandwiches are pretty quick to make, but I was happy with our overall meal. Located in Old Montreal but was a really good restaurant!! I came there twice because the Cuba panini was only on lunch menu.  It deserves visiting again. My friend and I had two divine brioches for breakfast.  My chocolate and banana one was the best of the world! Too much chocolate inside! Not too sweet but very crispy.  Soooo nice~ The Cuba panini was crunchy outside and gooey inside.  Melting cheese with bacon and salty turkey, never forgot.  Because it was the last meal in Montreal. The staff were all very pretty and friendly.  Love the ambience and decoration of the restaurant.  The price was reasonable. From the ratings to the many reviews on here, it's as good as it gets so I won't repeat the others, but a few of my own tips and observations:Let me preface that I was just visiting Montreal for the weekend, first time in the city. I came here essentially to get that Eggs In Yo Face (I'm sure you know what I mean) breakfast sandwich.   Note: The place currently opens at 9 am (on Saturdays).   From reading blogs, it suggested we get there at 8:30, we arrived at 8:40 to a closed restaurant.  We walked around and came back at 9:04 and already there was a line.  Luckily we managed to snag some seats at the high table though so definitely come early, this place is as popular as they say! I asked if I could get the sandwich without cheese - DENIED.   Said the cheese was already pre-mixed into the eggs.   I decided to chance it.  I've hated cheese my entire life, I've become quite adept at picking out cheese from food.   And glad I did, because all I had to do was open the sandwich and not eat the side on which the cheese was melted.  The rest was delicious and cheese free (uhm. . . but this also means the cheese could have easily been left out but. . . . whatever).   I asked for a knife and fork from a passing waitress (crucial tools in my cheese extraction). . . who reluctantly gave them to me with this request: "please be careful of the plates when  using the knife and fork, the plates scratch easily and can also break if you press too hard" - uhm.  really? I need to be careful of breaking plates. . . . . at a restaurant. . . . . with my utensils?  Sounds like someone bought some useless plates.  They were very pretty though. So why 5 stars for a place that refused me to go cheeseless and warns you of heavy utensil use? Cuz the food is delicious! Really, go and get the sandwich.  I miss it already.  Also the vibe is great.  Lovely cozy spot perfect for breakfast to fuel you up for a day of sightseeing.  Also, our main server (male) was great, super nice and friendly and overall we had a great meal.  Approx $70 Canadian (including tip) for 2 sandwiches, 1 fruit bowl, 1 pastry, 2 coffees and 2 very fresh squeezed orange juice for a party of 3. Olive & Gourmando is located in Old Montreal on Saint Paul.  It is just a couple of blocks off of the river near the old port. As other yelpers have written the place does a brisk business, mainly with the tourist trade.  However, Olive & Gourmand is a pretty good place for fresh baked goods, good coffee and an excellent brunch.  We had about a 20-minute wait for our table for 3. The food we had was all very fresh and had nice flavors.  I had the Goat Cheese Sandwich (Mild goat cheese paillot and caramelized onions.  Served with their house made ketchup) and it was excellent.  We also had coffee and some really special baked goods. The prices are not too bad either being in the heart of the tourist district.  Our server was really nice also. Every time I set foot in here for breakfast (or lunch), I'm always pleased with the food quality, the excellent & friend service and the eclectic and welcoming decor!You'll often hear patrons of Olive & Gourmand complimenting them on the "concept". . .  interesting because when you ask veteran Marie-Helene and Sandra, or "old crusts" as they jokingly call themselves, there is no concept.  It's just the result  of a slow evolution of bringing goodness and joy to people, season after season. The hustle and bustle can perhaps turn off some people who prefer quietness when sipping their café but if you're like me and love the vibe, the energy, the possibility of striking serendipitous conversations with locals or out-of-towners, and the soothing humming of the hustle & bustle this iconic place delivers then you're in for happy times!Whether you're vegan, vegetarian, or a carnivore (me), Olive & Gourmando redefines what wholesome, homemade food should be. What a beautiful, cozy place! The food is delicious; the salads and sandwiches are always my choice and the pastry are just perfect for my usual cappuccino! I love the vibe of the place; the moment you take your seat at the table, the day becomes better, surrounded with those beautiful smells of coffee and toasted bread and muffins :)The service is perfect, it always comes with a smile and with the answers and suggestions you need!The-best-place in Montreal for breakfast and brunch.  Oh wow, I still remember the taste of their numerous and beautiful pastries I tried with my boyfriend.  Flaky, buttery, fruity deliciousness in buns, croissants, danishes and donuts.  Everything was delicious and I wish I tried everything else.  Place was super busy when we got there so we grabbed food to go instead.  Get there early if you want to sit down or be prepare to wait. Outstanding bakery. Excellent for breakfast or lunch.   Salad and  sandwich listings are a bit limited, but you are bound to find something you like.   The baked products are some of the best I have tasted.   The lines can be long on the weekend. . . so get there expecting to wait. Service: Great, though we had to wait for about 20 min.  It was a Saturday afternoon around 4 pm.  This may be why it was so busy. Food: Really excellent.  My date had an excellent sandwich and my salad was delicious.  Everything was local and organic, always a plus in my book. Atmosphere: Really loud, but cool and trendy. Pricing: Slightly overpriced, but when you consider the quality of the ingredients, it may be the right price-point. I love how this place feels! Very cozy and hipster - you'll know what I mean.  The staff was very organized despite the place being very busy.  We were given a place all the way in the back corner of the shop and I was worried that we would be forgotten - we weren't.  If you ever wanted to try that increasingly popular 1642 Montreal Cola, then look no further.  I tried the grilled Cuban panini and it was good - crunchy and cheesy.  The habibi chicken, in my opinion, was better.  Anything tastes good with garlic, pickles, and dill.  Also there are vegetarian and vegan options if you're not a meat eater. If you're passing nearby the Old Port then you should definitely come by this place. Good, but pricey and a little strange.  We waited for about 45 minutes for a table for two, so obviously this place is popular.  You are packed in, basically sitting shoulder to shoulder with the person next to you.  We got fussed at for putting our jackets in the window sill (a little strange), so we had jackets piled on the backs of our chairs.  I ordered the Cuban, which was delicious, but pricey at over $10 without any sides.  I asked for a side of chips, and all they have are full size bags of chips made for multiple people. . .  So it became close to $20 for a sandwich and chips.  Like I said, the food was delicious, but it's pricey for what you get and you don't have much space. TREAT YO SELF.  This place is worth the AMAZING food.  I was in Montreal for a total of 24 hrs & this place was recommended to me by a friend.  I do not speak French.  At.  All.  The waiter was so patient with me & did his best to explain the specials of the day.  He ended up just simplifying the day's soup to "chicken noodle soup" & also recommended one of the sandwiches.  I felt so bad after.  The soup was amazinggggg it did not deserve to be simplified to a mere chicken noodle soup & for that I'm so sorry.  It was so good.  The sandwich was such a large portion & so great, I had half & saved the other half for later.  It's also located in old Montreal, which is such a great place to walk around & take in the old architecture.  Completely recommend!!I absolutely love this place.  I was there years ago but still remember how quaint and cozy and warming this place was.  The service was super friendly and the food was on par.  I'm planning on going back next year and this is my first stop when I go back. This place came highly recommended to me.  I was visiting Montreal for the first time, and I was told that this cafe had the best coffee and baked goods.  There was an off-hand mention of the "beautiful but ill-tempered" employees but I glossed over it.  MISTAKE. We arrived and were seated promptly.  Upon attempting to order, we discovered they were out of nearly everything we wanted.  It was around 11am, and they told us they were out of coffee and the first two sandwiches I tried to order.  I work as a waitress in a restaurant.  I understand that it is not the fault of the waiters that items run out.  However, the rude, irritated attitude of the waiter was uncalled for.  If your menu is only 10-12 items long and 2 of them are sold out, you should tell people before they survey the menu.  Or apologize for the inconvenience.  I tried to order a third sandwich modified without mushroom, which I was told was not possible.  I ended up ordering the vegan sandwich. The sandwich was excellent. That being said, the overall experience was so poor that I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  There are plenty of other restaurants in Montreal with exceptional food and good service. Popped in toward the end of their brunch and it was still pretty crowded, but we managed to snag a table for two by one of their cute little windows. The space is great.  Chalkboards with doodles and menu items cover the walls and the cute cafe by the entrance has some goodies for sale.  The space gets crowded quick but it's a lively atmosphere.  In the summer, there's no AC but thank the heavens this is a corner location and the open air windows let in a slight breeze. Once seated, our server informed us a lot of the menu items are done for the day since its the end of brunch but the options left sounded just as delightful.  I had the mixed salad with chicken and my boyfriend had the Cuban sandwich.  Both were SPECTACULAR.  Although it was a different take on a classic, this was probably the best Cuban I've ever tried.  The pesto mayo made this dish! The mixed salad sounds so simple but it was SO good, the toasted almonds and the chopped chicken gave this salad the kick it didn't even need.  I loved how light but tasty the dressing was.  I wanted to come back the next day to have the same meal again, even though I don't like visiting the same restaurant twice while on vacation.  It was that good. This place isn't overrated or as pretentious as it sounds or looks - go check it out!Looking for a good cup of coffee and pastry, my doorman recommended this place - and he was right, it is fantastic!

The host told us it would be a 25-30 minute wait, but when we came back around 12:30pm, he told us another 25 minutes, so that was pretty annoying that the estimated timing was wayyy off, but we got coffee at a nearby café so that was fine.  They also serve coffee and pastries in the takeout line, so that's nice to have while you wait. The place itself is very cozy and cute.  We sat on a communal table and I ordered a Goat Cheese and Onion Panini and a raspberry lemonade.  The Panini came with a homemade ketchup which was thinned out ketchup that was sweet but still tangy - it complemented the sandwich perfectly.  I couldn't finish the whole Panini by myself.  My friends ordered the Cuban sandwich and the Cajun Chicken Sandwich, which they all enjoyed.  Great to share the Paninis with friends for some variation in your overall meal.  I was sad to hear that they ran out of the egg in your face Panini -- I really wanted to try that!The service was pretty quick as all the sandwiches were premade, which I thought it was odd, considering sandwiches are pretty quick to make, but I was happy with our overall meal. Located in Old Montreal but was a really good restaurant!! I came there twice because the Cuba panini was only on lunch menu.  It deserves visiting again. My friend and I had two divine brioches for breakfast.  My chocolate and banana one was the best of the world! Too much chocolate inside! Not too sweet but very crispy.  Soooo nice~ The Cuba panini was crunchy outside and gooey inside.  Melting cheese with bacon and salty turkey, never forgot.  Because it was the last meal in Montreal. The staff were all very pretty and friendly.  Love the ambience and decoration of the restaurant.  The price was reasonable. From the ratings to the many reviews on here, it's as good as it gets so I won't repeat the others, but a few of my own tips and observations:Let me preface that I was just visiting Montreal for the weekend, first time in the city. I came here essentially to get that Eggs In Yo Face (I'm sure you know what I mean) breakfast sandwich.   Note: The place currently opens at 9 am (on Saturdays).   From reading blogs, it suggested we get there at 8:30, we arrived at 8:40 to a closed restaurant.  We walked around and came back at 9:04 and already there was a line.  Luckily we managed to snag some seats at the high table though so definitely come early, this place is as popular as they say! I asked if I could get the sandwich without cheese - DENIED.   Said the cheese was already pre-mixed into the eggs.   I decided to chance it.  I've hated cheese my entire life, I've become quite adept at picking out cheese from food.   And glad I did, because all I had to do was open the sandwich and not eat the side on which the cheese was melted.  The rest was delicious and cheese free (uhm. . . but this also means the cheese could have easily been left out but. . . . whatever).   I asked for a knife and fork from a passing waitress (crucial tools in my cheese extraction). . . who reluctantly gave them to me with this request: "please be careful of the plates when  using the knife and fork, the plates scratch easily and can also break if you press too hard" - uhm.  really? I need to be careful of breaking plates. . . . . at a restaurant. . . . . with my utensils?  Sounds like someone bought some useless plates.  They were very pretty though. So why 5 stars for a place that refused me to go cheeseless and warns you of heavy utensil use? Cuz the food is delicious! Really, go and get the sandwich.  I miss it already.  Also the vibe is great.  Lovely cozy spot perfect for breakfast to fuel you up for a day of sightseeing.  Also, our main server (male) was great, super nice and friendly and overall we had a great meal.  Approx $70 Canadian (including tip) for 2 sandwiches, 1 fruit bowl, 1 pastry, 2 coffees and 2 very fresh squeezed orange juice for a party of 3. Olive & Gourmando is located in Old Montreal on Saint Paul.  It is just a couple of blocks off of the river near the old port. As other yelpers have written the place does a brisk business, mainly with the tourist trade.  However, Olive & Gourmand is a pretty good place for fresh baked goods, good coffee and an excellent brunch.  We had about a 20-minute wait for our table for 3. The food we had was all very fresh and had nice flavors.  I had the Goat Cheese Sandwich (Mild goat cheese paillot and caramelized onions.  Served with their house made ketchup) and it was excellent.  We also had coffee and some really special baked goods. The prices are not too bad either being in the heart of the tourist district.  Our server was really nice also. Every time I set foot in here for breakfast (or lunch), I'm always pleased with the food quality, the excellent & friend service and the eclectic and welcoming decor!You'll often hear patrons of Olive & Gourmand complimenting them on the "concept". . .  interesting because when you ask veteran Marie-Helene and Sandra, or "old crusts" as they jokingly call themselves, there is no concept.  It's just the result  of a slow evolution of bringing goodness and joy to people, season after season. The hustle and bustle can perhaps turn off some people who prefer quietness when sipping their café but if you're like me and love the vibe, the energy, the possibility of striking serendipitous conversations with locals or out-of-towners, and the soothing humming of the hustle & bustle this iconic place delivers then you're in for happy times!Whether you're vegan, vegetarian, or a carnivore (me), Olive & Gourmando redefines what wholesome, homemade food should be. What a beautiful, cozy place! The food is delicious; the salads and sandwiches are always my choice and the pastry are just perfect for my usual cappuccino! I love the vibe of the place; the moment you take your seat at the table, the day becomes better, surrounded with those beautiful smells of coffee and toasted bread and muffins :)The service is perfect, it always comes with a smile and with the answers and suggestions you need!The-best-place in Montreal for breakfast and brunch.  Oh wow, I still remember the taste of their numerous and beautiful pastries I tried with my boyfriend.  Flaky, buttery, fruity deliciousness in buns, croissants, danishes and donuts.  Everything was delicious and I wish I tried everything else.  Place was super busy when we got there so we grabbed food to go instead.  Get there early if you want to sit down or be prepare to wait. Outstanding bakery. Excellent for breakfast or lunch.   Salad and  sandwich listings are a bit limited, but you are bound to find something you like.   The baked products are some of the best I have tasted.   The lines can be long on the weekend. . . so get there expecting to wait. Service: Great, though we had to wait for about 20 min.  It was a Saturday afternoon around 4 pm.  This may be why it was so busy. Food: Really excellent.  My date had an excellent sandwich and my salad was delicious.  Everything was local and organic, always a plus in my book. Atmosphere: Really loud, but cool and trendy. Pricing: Slightly overpriced, but when you consider the quality of the ingredients, it may be the right price-point. I love how this place feels! Very cozy and hipster - you'll know what I mean.  The staff was very organized despite the place being very busy.  We were given a place all the way in the back corner of the shop and I was worried that we would be forgotten - we weren't.  If you ever wanted to try that increasingly popular 1642 Montreal Cola, then look no further.  I tried the grilled Cuban panini and it was good - crunchy and cheesy.  The habibi chicken, in my opinion, was better.  Anything tastes good with garlic, pickles, and dill.  Also there are vegetarian and vegan options if you're not a meat eater. If you're passing nearby the Old Port then you should definitely come by this place. Good, but pricey and a little strange.  We waited for about 45 minutes for a table for two, so obviously this place is popular.  You are packed in, basically sitting shoulder to shoulder with the person next to you.  We got fussed at for putting our jackets in the window sill (a little strange), so we had jackets piled on the backs of our chairs.  I ordered the Cuban, which was delicious, but pricey at over $10 without any sides.  I asked for a side of chips, and all they have are full size bags of chips made for multiple people. . .  So it became close to $20 for a sandwich and chips.  Like I said, the food was delicious, but it's pricey for what you get and you don't have much space. TREAT YO SELF.  This place is worth the AMAZING food.  I was in Montreal for a total of 24 hrs & this place was recommended to me by a friend.  I do not speak French.  At.  All.  The waiter was so patient with me & did his best to explain the specials of the day.  He ended up just simplifying the day's soup to "chicken noodle soup" & also recommended one of the sandwiches.  I felt so bad after.  The soup was amazinggggg it did not deserve to be simplified to a mere chicken noodle soup & for that I'm so sorry.  It was so good.  The sandwich was such a large portion & so great, I had half & saved the other half for later.  It's also located in old Montreal, which is such a great place to walk around & take in the old architecture.  Completely recommend!!I absolutely love this place.  I was there years ago but still remember how quaint and cozy and warming this place was.  The service was super friendly and the food was on par.  I'm planning on going back next year and this is my first stop when I go back. This place came highly recommended to me.  I was visiting Montreal for the first time, and I was told that this cafe had the best coffee and baked goods.  There was an off-hand mention of the "beautiful but ill-tempered" employees but I glossed over it.  MISTAKE. We arrived and were seated promptly.  Upon attempting to order, we discovered they were out of nearly everything we wanted.  It was around 11am, and they told us they were out of coffee and the first two sandwiches I tried to order.  I work as a waitress in a restaurant.  I understand that it is not the fault of the waiters that items run out.  However, the rude, irritated attitude of the waiter was uncalled for.  If your menu is only 10-12 items long and 2 of them are sold out, you should tell people before they survey the menu.  Or apologize for the inconvenience.  I tried to order a third sandwich modified without mushroom, which I was told was not possible.  I ended up ordering the vegan sandwich. The sandwich was excellent. That being said, the overall experience was so poor that I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  There are plenty of other restaurants in Montreal with exceptional food and good service. Popped in toward the end of their brunch and it was still pretty crowded, but we managed to snag a table for two by one of their cute little windows. The space is great.  Chalkboards with doodles and menu items cover the walls and the cute cafe by the entrance has some goodies for sale.  The space gets crowded quick but it's a lively atmosphere.  In the summer, there's no AC but thank the heavens this is a corner location and the open air windows let in a slight breeze. Once seated, our server informed us a lot of the menu items are done for the day since its the end of brunch but the options left sounded just as delightful.  I had the mixed salad with chicken and my boyfriend had the Cuban sandwich.  Both were SPECTACULAR.  Although it was a different take on a classic, this was probably the best Cuban I've ever tried.  The pesto mayo made this dish! The mixed salad sounds so simple but it was SO good, the toasted almonds and the chopped chicken gave this salad the kick it didn't even need.  I loved how light but tasty the dressing was.  I wanted to come back the next day to have the same meal again, even though I don't like visiting the same restaurant twice while on vacation.  It was that good. This place isn't overrated or as pretentious as it sounds or looks - go check it out!Looking for a good cup of coffee and pastry, my doorman recommended this place - and he was right, it is fantastic! The place is small and every table was full with a wait.  I just grabbed a late and croissant to go.  The late was made perfectly.  Oh, and the croissant. . . oh la la! It did remind me of Paris. I think I definitely worked this place up in my head by reading all the reviews and then was a bit disappointed.  Don't get me wrong the food is good and the quality of the ingredients is great.  But is it worth the price, the wait and sitting shoulder to shoulder cramped with other guests. . . probably not.  I've been here twice.  Once for take out and once for a sit down meal.  For take out I ordered the banana chocolate brioche and a cappuccino.  It was good.  The pastry was delicious.  However I think the tiny cappuccinos are quite overpriced and nothing special.  For the sit down meal I got there at 10:40 am and it wasn't too busy.  I tried to order the 'in your face egg panini' which they were sold out of.  How do you sell out of eggs and bread at a breakfast place by 10:40? It wasn't a big deal, but it made a difference since their menu is already very small and limited.  I also noticed it's a trend in the other reviews.  Anyways I ordered the ricotta with honey and bread and an almond croissant.  Both were delicious.  The ricotta is creamy and refreshing.  The almond croissant is good but overpriced in my opinion.  I do have to say that the service there was lovely.  Everything was delivered quickly and with a smile.  However overall I think this place is a bit overrated.  Would I go here for lunch once in a while if I worked nearby, sure.  Would I go out of my way to come here? Probably not.  There are so many other cafes in this area with incredible cappuccinos and pastries at almost half the cost and half the crowds. The best cuban sandwich in Montreal according to me.  And the best in North America, according to Anthony Bourdain. In fact, all sandwiches are pretty awesome.  But how to resist O+G's sandwich filled with gooey gruyère, ham, pork loin and their secret sauce? Feeling a bit more healthy? The "24" salad with asian flavors is a good choice too. And how to resist their beautiful selection of baked desserts?Did I say how I love O+G ? Try it, you won't be disappointed. This place gets 5 stars from me, at least from the breakfast standpoint.  We came here because it was a highly recommended spot located in Old Montreal, and we wanted to try it out.  For breakfast I had a coffee, and the granola.  The granola is amazing it comes with yoghurt and a bunch of different types of fruit.  It was delicious.  I also had a chocolate and banana pastry which was super yummy as well.

The rest was delicious and cheese free (uhm. . . but this also means the cheese could have easily been left out but. . . . whatever).   I asked for a knife and fork from a passing waitress (crucial tools in my cheese extraction). . . who reluctantly gave them to me with this request: "please be careful of the plates when  using the knife and fork, the plates scratch easily and can also break if you press too hard" - uhm.  really? I need to be careful of breaking plates. . . . . at a restaurant. . . . . with my utensils?  Sounds like someone bought some useless plates.  They were very pretty though. So why 5 stars for a place that refused me to go cheeseless and warns you of heavy utensil use? Cuz the food is delicious! Really, go and get the sandwich.  I miss it already.  Also the vibe is great.  Lovely cozy spot perfect for breakfast to fuel you up for a day of sightseeing.  Also, our main server (male) was great, super nice and friendly and overall we had a great meal.  Approx $70 Canadian (including tip) for 2 sandwiches, 1 fruit bowl, 1 pastry, 2 coffees and 2 very fresh squeezed orange juice for a party of 3. Olive & Gourmando is located in Old Montreal on Saint Paul.  It is just a couple of blocks off of the river near the old port. As other yelpers have written the place does a brisk business, mainly with the tourist trade.  However, Olive & Gourmand is a pretty good place for fresh baked goods, good coffee and an excellent brunch.  We had about a 20-minute wait for our table for 3. The food we had was all very fresh and had nice flavors.  I had the Goat Cheese Sandwich (Mild goat cheese paillot and caramelized onions.  Served with their house made ketchup) and it was excellent.  We also had coffee and some really special baked goods. The prices are not too bad either being in the heart of the tourist district.  Our server was really nice also. Every time I set foot in here for breakfast (or lunch), I'm always pleased with the food quality, the excellent & friend service and the eclectic and welcoming decor!You'll often hear patrons of Olive & Gourmand complimenting them on the "concept". . .  interesting because when you ask veteran Marie-Helene and Sandra, or "old crusts" as they jokingly call themselves, there is no concept.  It's just the result  of a slow evolution of bringing goodness and joy to people, season after season. The hustle and bustle can perhaps turn off some people who prefer quietness when sipping their café but if you're like me and love the vibe, the energy, the possibility of striking serendipitous conversations with locals or out-of-towners, and the soothing humming of the hustle & bustle this iconic place delivers then you're in for happy times!Whether you're vegan, vegetarian, or a carnivore (me), Olive & Gourmando redefines what wholesome, homemade food should be. What a beautiful, cozy place! The food is delicious; the salads and sandwiches are always my choice and the pastry are just perfect for my usual cappuccino! I love the vibe of the place; the moment you take your seat at the table, the day becomes better, surrounded with those beautiful smells of coffee and toasted bread and muffins :)The service is perfect, it always comes with a smile and with the answers and suggestions you need!The-best-place in Montreal for breakfast and brunch.  Oh wow, I still remember the taste of their numerous and beautiful pastries I tried with my boyfriend.  Flaky, buttery, fruity deliciousness in buns, croissants, danishes and donuts.  Everything was delicious and I wish I tried everything else.  Place was super busy when we got there so we grabbed food to go instead.  Get there early if you want to sit down or be prepare to wait. Outstanding bakery. Excellent for breakfast or lunch.   Salad and  sandwich listings are a bit limited, but you are bound to find something you like.   The baked products are some of the best I have tasted.   The lines can be long on the weekend. . . so get there expecting to wait. Service: Great, though we had to wait for about 20 min.  It was a Saturday afternoon around 4 pm.  This may be why it was so busy. Food: Really excellent.  My date had an excellent sandwich and my salad was delicious.  Everything was local and organic, always a plus in my book. Atmosphere: Really loud, but cool and trendy. Pricing: Slightly overpriced, but when you consider the quality of the ingredients, it may be the right price-point. I love how this place feels! Very cozy and hipster - you'll know what I mean.  The staff was very organized despite the place being very busy.  We were given a place all the way in the back corner of the shop and I was worried that we would be forgotten - we weren't.  If you ever wanted to try that increasingly popular 1642 Montreal Cola, then look no further.  I tried the grilled Cuban panini and it was good - crunchy and cheesy.  The habibi chicken, in my opinion, was better.  Anything tastes good with garlic, pickles, and dill.  Also there are vegetarian and vegan options if you're not a meat eater. If you're passing nearby the Old Port then you should definitely come by this place. Good, but pricey and a little strange.  We waited for about 45 minutes for a table for two, so obviously this place is popular.  You are packed in, basically sitting shoulder to shoulder with the person next to you.  We got fussed at for putting our jackets in the window sill (a little strange), so we had jackets piled on the backs of our chairs.  I ordered the Cuban, which was delicious, but pricey at over $10 without any sides.  I asked for a side of chips, and all they have are full size bags of chips made for multiple people. . .  So it became close to $20 for a sandwich and chips.  Like I said, the food was delicious, but it's pricey for what you get and you don't have much space. TREAT YO SELF.  This place is worth the AMAZING food.  I was in Montreal for a total of 24 hrs & this place was recommended to me by a friend.  I do not speak French.  At.  All.  The waiter was so patient with me & did his best to explain the specials of the day.  He ended up just simplifying the day's soup to "chicken noodle soup" & also recommended one of the sandwiches.  I felt so bad after.  The soup was amazinggggg it did not deserve to be simplified to a mere chicken noodle soup & for that I'm so sorry.  It was so good.  The sandwich was such a large portion & so great, I had half & saved the other half for later.  It's also located in old Montreal, which is such a great place to walk around & take in the old architecture.  Completely recommend!!I absolutely love this place.  I was there years ago but still remember how quaint and cozy and warming this place was.  The service was super friendly and the food was on par.  I'm planning on going back next year and this is my first stop when I go back. This place came highly recommended to me.  I was visiting Montreal for the first time, and I was told that this cafe had the best coffee and baked goods.  There was an off-hand mention of the "beautiful but ill-tempered" employees but I glossed over it.  MISTAKE. We arrived and were seated promptly.  Upon attempting to order, we discovered they were out of nearly everything we wanted.  It was around 11am, and they told us they were out of coffee and the first two sandwiches I tried to order.  I work as a waitress in a restaurant.  I understand that it is not the fault of the waiters that items run out.  However, the rude, irritated attitude of the waiter was uncalled for.  If your menu is only 10-12 items long and 2 of them are sold out, you should tell people before they survey the menu.  Or apologize for the inconvenience.  I tried to order a third sandwich modified without mushroom, which I was told was not possible.  I ended up ordering the vegan sandwich. The sandwich was excellent. That being said, the overall experience was so poor that I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  There are plenty of other restaurants in Montreal with exceptional food and good service. Popped in toward the end of their brunch and it was still pretty crowded, but we managed to snag a table for two by one of their cute little windows. The space is great.  Chalkboards with doodles and menu items cover the walls and the cute cafe by the entrance has some goodies for sale.  The space gets crowded quick but it's a lively atmosphere.  In the summer, there's no AC but thank the heavens this is a corner location and the open air windows let in a slight breeze. Once seated, our server informed us a lot of the menu items are done for the day since its the end of brunch but the options left sounded just as delightful.  I had the mixed salad with chicken and my boyfriend had the Cuban sandwich.  Both were SPECTACULAR.  Although it was a different take on a classic, this was probably the best Cuban I've ever tried.  The pesto mayo made this dish! The mixed salad sounds so simple but it was SO good, the toasted almonds and the chopped chicken gave this salad the kick it didn't even need.  I loved how light but tasty the dressing was.  I wanted to come back the next day to have the same meal again, even though I don't like visiting the same restaurant twice while on vacation.  It was that good. This place isn't overrated or as pretentious as it sounds or looks - go check it out!Looking for a good cup of coffee and pastry, my doorman recommended this place - and he was right, it is fantastic! The place is small and every table was full with a wait.  I just grabbed a late and croissant to go.  The late was made perfectly.  Oh, and the croissant. . . oh la la! It did remind me of Paris. I think I definitely worked this place up in my head by reading all the reviews and then was a bit disappointed.  Don't get me wrong the food is good and the quality of the ingredients is great.  But is it worth the price, the wait and sitting shoulder to shoulder cramped with other guests. . . probably not.  I've been here twice.  Once for take out and once for a sit down meal.  For take out I ordered the banana chocolate brioche and a cappuccino.  It was good.  The pastry was delicious.  However I think the tiny cappuccinos are quite overpriced and nothing special.  For the sit down meal I got there at 10:40 am and it wasn't too busy.  I tried to order the 'in your face egg panini' which they were sold out of.  How do you sell out of eggs and bread at a breakfast place by 10:40? It wasn't a big deal, but it made a difference since their menu is already very small and limited.  I also noticed it's a trend in the other reviews.  Anyways I ordered the ricotta with honey and bread and an almond croissant.  Both were delicious.  The ricotta is creamy and refreshing.  The almond croissant is good but overpriced in my opinion.  I do have to say that the service there was lovely.  Everything was delivered quickly and with a smile.  However overall I think this place is a bit overrated.  Would I go here for lunch once in a while if I worked nearby, sure.  Would I go out of my way to come here? Probably not.  There are so many other cafes in this area with incredible cappuccinos and pastries at almost half the cost and half the crowds. The best cuban sandwich in Montreal according to me.  And the best in North America, according to Anthony Bourdain. In fact, all sandwiches are pretty awesome.  But how to resist O+G's sandwich filled with gooey gruyère, ham, pork loin and their secret sauce? Feeling a bit more healthy? The "24" salad with asian flavors is a good choice too. And how to resist their beautiful selection of baked desserts?Did I say how I love O+G ? Try it, you won't be disappointed. This place gets 5 stars from me, at least from the breakfast standpoint.  We came here because it was a highly recommended spot located in Old Montreal, and we wanted to try it out.  For breakfast I had a coffee, and the granola.  The granola is amazing it comes with yoghurt and a bunch of different types of fruit.  It was delicious.  I also had a chocolate and banana pastry which was super yummy as well. This place is very busy but we were seated and served pretty quickly.  I really liked this place and would totally come here again. Came here on Saturday for lunch around 12pm.  The host told us it would be a 25-30 minute wait, but when we came back around 12:30pm, he told us another 25 minutes, so that was pretty annoying that the estimated timing was wayyy off, but we got coffee at a nearby café so that was fine.  They also serve coffee and pastries in the takeout line, so that's nice to have while you wait. The place itself is very cozy and cute.  We sat on a communal table and I ordered a Goat Cheese and Onion Panini and a raspberry lemonade.  The Panini came with a homemade ketchup which was thinned out ketchup that was sweet but still tangy - it complemented the sandwich perfectly.  I couldn't finish the whole Panini by myself.  My friends ordered the Cuban sandwich and the Cajun Chicken Sandwich, which they all enjoyed.  Great to share the Paninis with friends for some variation in your overall meal.  I was sad to hear that they ran out of the egg in your face Panini -- I really wanted to try that!The service was pretty quick as all the sandwiches were premade, which I thought it was odd, considering sandwiches are pretty quick to make, but I was happy with our overall meal. Located in Old Montreal but was a really good restaurant!! I came there twice because the Cuba panini was only on lunch menu.  It deserves visiting again. My friend and I had two divine brioches for breakfast.  My chocolate and banana one was the best of the world! Too much chocolate inside! Not too sweet but very crispy.  Soooo nice~ The Cuba panini was crunchy outside and gooey inside.  Melting cheese with bacon and salty turkey, never forgot.  Because it was the last meal in Montreal. The staff were all very pretty and friendly.  Love the ambience and decoration of the restaurant.  The price was reasonable. From the ratings to the many reviews on here, it's as good as it gets so I won't repeat the others, but a few of my own tips and observations:Let me preface that I was just visiting Montreal for the weekend, first time in the city. I came here essentially to get that Eggs In Yo Face (I'm sure you know what I mean) breakfast sandwich.   Note: The place currently opens at 9 am (on Saturdays).   From reading blogs, it suggested we get there at 8:30, we arrived at 8:40 to a closed restaurant.  We walked around and came back at 9:04 and already there was a line.  Luckily we managed to snag some seats at the high table though so definitely come early, this place is as popular as they say! I asked if I could get the sandwich without cheese - DENIED.   Said the cheese was already pre-mixed into the eggs.   I decided to chance it.  I've hated cheese my entire life, I've become quite adept at picking out cheese from food.   And glad I did, because all I had to do was open the sandwich and not eat the side on which the cheese was melted.

I love the vibe of the place; the moment you take your seat at the table, the day becomes better, surrounded with those beautiful smells of coffee and toasted bread and muffins :)The service is perfect, it always comes with a smile and with the answers and suggestions you need!The-best-place in Montreal for breakfast and brunch.  Oh wow, I still remember the taste of their numerous and beautiful pastries I tried with my boyfriend.  Flaky, buttery, fruity deliciousness in buns, croissants, danishes and donuts.  Everything was delicious and I wish I tried everything else.  Place was super busy when we got there so we grabbed food to go instead.  Get there early if you want to sit down or be prepare to wait. Outstanding bakery. Excellent for breakfast or lunch.   Salad and  sandwich listings are a bit limited, but you are bound to find something you like.   The baked products are some of the best I have tasted.   The lines can be long on the weekend. . . so get there expecting to wait. Service: Great, though we had to wait for about 20 min.  It was a Saturday afternoon around 4 pm.  This may be why it was so busy. Food: Really excellent.  My date had an excellent sandwich and my salad was delicious.  Everything was local and organic, always a plus in my book. Atmosphere: Really loud, but cool and trendy. Pricing: Slightly overpriced, but when you consider the quality of the ingredients, it may be the right price-point. I love how this place feels! Very cozy and hipster - you'll know what I mean.  The staff was very organized despite the place being very busy.  We were given a place all the way in the back corner of the shop and I was worried that we would be forgotten - we weren't.  If you ever wanted to try that increasingly popular 1642 Montreal Cola, then look no further.  I tried the grilled Cuban panini and it was good - crunchy and cheesy.  The habibi chicken, in my opinion, was better.  Anything tastes good with garlic, pickles, and dill.  Also there are vegetarian and vegan options if you're not a meat eater. If you're passing nearby the Old Port then you should definitely come by this place. Good, but pricey and a little strange.  We waited for about 45 minutes for a table for two, so obviously this place is popular.  You are packed in, basically sitting shoulder to shoulder with the person next to you.  We got fussed at for putting our jackets in the window sill (a little strange), so we had jackets piled on the backs of our chairs.  I ordered the Cuban, which was delicious, but pricey at over $10 without any sides.  I asked for a side of chips, and all they have are full size bags of chips made for multiple people. . .  So it became close to $20 for a sandwich and chips.  Like I said, the food was delicious, but it's pricey for what you get and you don't have much space. TREAT YO SELF.  This place is worth the AMAZING food.  I was in Montreal for a total of 24 hrs & this place was recommended to me by a friend.  I do not speak French.  At.  All.  The waiter was so patient with me & did his best to explain the specials of the day.  He ended up just simplifying the day's soup to "chicken noodle soup" & also recommended one of the sandwiches.  I felt so bad after.  The soup was amazinggggg it did not deserve to be simplified to a mere chicken noodle soup & for that I'm so sorry.  It was so good.  The sandwich was such a large portion & so great, I had half & saved the other half for later.  It's also located in old Montreal, which is such a great place to walk around & take in the old architecture.  Completely recommend!!I absolutely love this place.  I was there years ago but still remember how quaint and cozy and warming this place was.  The service was super friendly and the food was on par.  I'm planning on going back next year and this is my first stop when I go back. This place came highly recommended to me.  I was visiting Montreal for the first time, and I was told that this cafe had the best coffee and baked goods.  There was an off-hand mention of the "beautiful but ill-tempered" employees but I glossed over it.  MISTAKE. We arrived and were seated promptly.  Upon attempting to order, we discovered they were out of nearly everything we wanted.  It was around 11am, and they told us they were out of coffee and the first two sandwiches I tried to order.  I work as a waitress in a restaurant.  I understand that it is not the fault of the waiters that items run out.  However, the rude, irritated attitude of the waiter was uncalled for.  If your menu is only 10-12 items long and 2 of them are sold out, you should tell people before they survey the menu.  Or apologize for the inconvenience.  I tried to order a third sandwich modified without mushroom, which I was told was not possible.  I ended up ordering the vegan sandwich. The sandwich was excellent. That being said, the overall experience was so poor that I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  There are plenty of other restaurants in Montreal with exceptional food and good service. Popped in toward the end of their brunch and it was still pretty crowded, but we managed to snag a table for two by one of their cute little windows. The space is great.  Chalkboards with doodles and menu items cover the walls and the cute cafe by the entrance has some goodies for sale.  The space gets crowded quick but it's a lively atmosphere.  In the summer, there's no AC but thank the heavens this is a corner location and the open air windows let in a slight breeze. Once seated, our server informed us a lot of the menu items are done for the day since its the end of brunch but the options left sounded just as delightful.  I had the mixed salad with chicken and my boyfriend had the Cuban sandwich.  Both were SPECTACULAR.  Although it was a different take on a classic, this was probably the best Cuban I've ever tried.  The pesto mayo made this dish! The mixed salad sounds so simple but it was SO good, the toasted almonds and the chopped chicken gave this salad the kick it didn't even need.  I loved how light but tasty the dressing was.  I wanted to come back the next day to have the same meal again, even though I don't like visiting the same restaurant twice while on vacation.  It was that good. This place isn't overrated or as pretentious as it sounds or looks - go check it out!Looking for a good cup of coffee and pastry, my doorman recommended this place - and he was right, it is fantastic! The place is small and every table was full with a wait.  I just grabbed a late and croissant to go.  The late was made perfectly.  Oh, and the croissant. . . oh la la! It did remind me of Paris. I think I definitely worked this place up in my head by reading all the reviews and then was a bit disappointed.  Don't get me wrong the food is good and the quality of the ingredients is great.  But is it worth the price, the wait and sitting shoulder to shoulder cramped with other guests. . . probably not.  I've been here twice.  Once for take out and once for a sit down meal.  For take out I ordered the banana chocolate brioche and a cappuccino.  It was good.  The pastry was delicious.  However I think the tiny cappuccinos are quite overpriced and nothing special.  For the sit down meal I got there at 10:40 am and it wasn't too busy.  I tried to order the 'in your face egg panini' which they were sold out of.  How do you sell out of eggs and bread at a breakfast place by 10:40? It wasn't a big deal, but it made a difference since their menu is already very small and limited.  I also noticed it's a trend in the other reviews.  Anyways I ordered the ricotta with honey and bread and an almond croissant.  Both were delicious.  The ricotta is creamy and refreshing.  The almond croissant is good but overpriced in my opinion.  I do have to say that the service there was lovely.  Everything was delivered quickly and with a smile.  However overall I think this place is a bit overrated.  Would I go here for lunch once in a while if I worked nearby, sure.  Would I go out of my way to come here? Probably not.  There are so many other cafes in this area with incredible cappuccinos and pastries at almost half the cost and half the crowds. The best cuban sandwich in Montreal according to me.  And the best in North America, according to Anthony Bourdain. In fact, all sandwiches are pretty awesome.  But how to resist O+G's sandwich filled with gooey gruyère, ham, pork loin and their secret sauce? Feeling a bit more healthy? The "24" salad with asian flavors is a good choice too. And how to resist their beautiful selection of baked desserts?Did I say how I love O+G ? Try it, you won't be disappointed. This place gets 5 stars from me, at least from the breakfast standpoint.  We came here because it was a highly recommended spot located in Old Montreal, and we wanted to try it out.  For breakfast I had a coffee, and the granola.  The granola is amazing it comes with yoghurt and a bunch of different types of fruit.  It was delicious.  I also had a chocolate and banana pastry which was super yummy as well. This place is very busy but we were seated and served pretty quickly.  I really liked this place and would totally come here again. Came here on Saturday for lunch around 12pm.  The host told us it would be a 25-30 minute wait, but when we came back around 12:30pm, he told us another 25 minutes, so that was pretty annoying that the estimated timing was wayyy off, but we got coffee at a nearby café so that was fine.  They also serve coffee and pastries in the takeout line, so that's nice to have while you wait. The place itself is very cozy and cute.  We sat on a communal table and I ordered a Goat Cheese and Onion Panini and a raspberry lemonade.  The Panini came with a homemade ketchup which was thinned out ketchup that was sweet but still tangy - it complemented the sandwich perfectly.  I couldn't finish the whole Panini by myself.  My friends ordered the Cuban sandwich and the Cajun Chicken Sandwich, which they all enjoyed.  Great to share the Paninis with friends for some variation in your overall meal.  I was sad to hear that they ran out of the egg in your face Panini -- I really wanted to try that!The service was pretty quick as all the sandwiches were premade, which I thought it was odd, considering sandwiches are pretty quick to make, but I was happy with our overall meal. Located in Old Montreal but was a really good restaurant!! I came there twice because the Cuba panini was only on lunch menu.  It deserves visiting again. My friend and I had two divine brioches for breakfast.  My chocolate and banana one was the best of the world! Too much chocolate inside! Not too sweet but very crispy.  Soooo nice~ The Cuba panini was crunchy outside and gooey inside.  Melting cheese with bacon and salty turkey, never forgot.  Because it was the last meal in Montreal. The staff were all very pretty and friendly.  Love the ambience and decoration of the restaurant.  The price was reasonable. From the ratings to the many reviews on here, it's as good as it gets so I won't repeat the others, but a few of my own tips and observations:Let me preface that I was just visiting Montreal for the weekend, first time in the city. I came here essentially to get that Eggs In Yo Face (I'm sure you know what I mean) breakfast sandwich.   Note: The place currently opens at 9 am (on Saturdays).   From reading blogs, it suggested we get there at 8:30, we arrived at 8:40 to a closed restaurant.  We walked around and came back at 9:04 and already there was a line.  Luckily we managed to snag some seats at the high table though so definitely come early, this place is as popular as they say! I asked if I could get the sandwich without cheese - DENIED.   Said the cheese was already pre-mixed into the eggs.   I decided to chance it.  I've hated cheese my entire life, I've become quite adept at picking out cheese from food.   And glad I did, because all I had to do was open the sandwich and not eat the side on which the cheese was melted.  The rest was delicious and cheese free (uhm. . . but this also means the cheese could have easily been left out but. . . . whatever).   I asked for a knife and fork from a passing waitress (crucial tools in my cheese extraction). . . who reluctantly gave them to me with this request: "please be careful of the plates when  using the knife and fork, the plates scratch easily and can also break if you press too hard" - uhm.  really? I need to be careful of breaking plates. . . . . at a restaurant. . . . . with my utensils?  Sounds like someone bought some useless plates.  They were very pretty though. So why 5 stars for a place that refused me to go cheeseless and warns you of heavy utensil use? Cuz the food is delicious! Really, go and get the sandwich.  I miss it already.  Also the vibe is great.  Lovely cozy spot perfect for breakfast to fuel you up for a day of sightseeing.  Also, our main server (male) was great, super nice and friendly and overall we had a great meal.  Approx $70 Canadian (including tip) for 2 sandwiches, 1 fruit bowl, 1 pastry, 2 coffees and 2 very fresh squeezed orange juice for a party of 3. Olive & Gourmando is located in Old Montreal on Saint Paul.  It is just a couple of blocks off of the river near the old port. As other yelpers have written the place does a brisk business, mainly with the tourist trade.  However, Olive & Gourmand is a pretty good place for fresh baked goods, good coffee and an excellent brunch.  We had about a 20-minute wait for our table for 3. The food we had was all very fresh and had nice flavors.  I had the Goat Cheese Sandwich (Mild goat cheese paillot and caramelized onions.  Served with their house made ketchup) and it was excellent.  We also had coffee and some really special baked goods. The prices are not too bad either being in the heart of the tourist district.  Our server was really nice also. Every time I set foot in here for breakfast (or lunch), I'm always pleased with the food quality, the excellent & friend service and the eclectic and welcoming decor!You'll often hear patrons of Olive & Gourmand complimenting them on the "concept". . .  interesting because when you ask veteran Marie-Helene and Sandra, or "old crusts" as they jokingly call themselves, there is no concept.  It's just the result  of a slow evolution of bringing goodness and joy to people, season after season. The hustle and bustle can perhaps turn off some people who prefer quietness when sipping their café but if you're like me and love the vibe, the energy, the possibility of striking serendipitous conversations with locals or out-of-towners, and the soothing humming of the hustle & bustle this iconic place delivers then you're in for happy times!Whether you're vegan, vegetarian, or a carnivore (me), Olive & Gourmando redefines what wholesome, homemade food should be.

This place is worth the AMAZING food.  I was in Montreal for a total of 24 hrs & this place was recommended to me by a friend.  I do not speak French.  At.  All.  The waiter was so patient with me & did his best to explain the specials of the day.  He ended up just simplifying the day's soup to "chicken noodle soup" & also recommended one of the sandwiches.  I felt so bad after.  The soup was amazinggggg it did not deserve to be simplified to a mere chicken noodle soup & for that I'm so sorry.  It was so good.  The sandwich was such a large portion & so great, I had half & saved the other half for later.  It's also located in old Montreal, which is such a great place to walk around & take in the old architecture.  Completely recommend!!I absolutely love this place.  I was there years ago but still remember how quaint and cozy and warming this place was.  The service was super friendly and the food was on par.  I'm planning on going back next year and this is my first stop when I go back. This place came highly recommended to me.  I was visiting Montreal for the first time, and I was told that this cafe had the best coffee and baked goods.  There was an off-hand mention of the "beautiful but ill-tempered" employees but I glossed over it.  MISTAKE. We arrived and were seated promptly.  Upon attempting to order, we discovered they were out of nearly everything we wanted.  It was around 11am, and they told us they were out of coffee and the first two sandwiches I tried to order.  I work as a waitress in a restaurant.  I understand that it is not the fault of the waiters that items run out.  However, the rude, irritated attitude of the waiter was uncalled for.  If your menu is only 10-12 items long and 2 of them are sold out, you should tell people before they survey the menu.  Or apologize for the inconvenience.  I tried to order a third sandwich modified without mushroom, which I was told was not possible.  I ended up ordering the vegan sandwich. The sandwich was excellent. That being said, the overall experience was so poor that I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  There are plenty of other restaurants in Montreal with exceptional food and good service. Popped in toward the end of their brunch and it was still pretty crowded, but we managed to snag a table for two by one of their cute little windows. The space is great.  Chalkboards with doodles and menu items cover the walls and the cute cafe by the entrance has some goodies for sale.  The space gets crowded quick but it's a lively atmosphere.  In the summer, there's no AC but thank the heavens this is a corner location and the open air windows let in a slight breeze. Once seated, our server informed us a lot of the menu items are done for the day since its the end of brunch but the options left sounded just as delightful.  I had the mixed salad with chicken and my boyfriend had the Cuban sandwich.  Both were SPECTACULAR.  Although it was a different take on a classic, this was probably the best Cuban I've ever tried.  The pesto mayo made this dish! The mixed salad sounds so simple but it was SO good, the toasted almonds and the chopped chicken gave this salad the kick it didn't even need.  I loved how light but tasty the dressing was.  I wanted to come back the next day to have the same meal again, even though I don't like visiting the same restaurant twice while on vacation.  It was that good. This place isn't overrated or as pretentious as it sounds or looks - go check it out!Looking for a good cup of coffee and pastry, my doorman recommended this place - and he was right, it is fantastic! The place is small and every table was full with a wait.  I just grabbed a late and croissant to go.  The late was made perfectly.  Oh, and the croissant. . . oh la la! It did remind me of Paris. I think I definitely worked this place up in my head by reading all the reviews and then was a bit disappointed.  Don't get me wrong the food is good and the quality of the ingredients is great.  But is it worth the price, the wait and sitting shoulder to shoulder cramped with other guests. . . probably not.  I've been here twice.  Once for take out and once for a sit down meal.  For take out I ordered the banana chocolate brioche and a cappuccino.  It was good.  The pastry was delicious.  However I think the tiny cappuccinos are quite overpriced and nothing special.  For the sit down meal I got there at 10:40 am and it wasn't too busy.  I tried to order the 'in your face egg panini' which they were sold out of.  How do you sell out of eggs and bread at a breakfast place by 10:40? It wasn't a big deal, but it made a difference since their menu is already very small and limited.  I also noticed it's a trend in the other reviews.  Anyways I ordered the ricotta with honey and bread and an almond croissant.  Both were delicious.  The ricotta is creamy and refreshing.  The almond croissant is good but overpriced in my opinion.  I do have to say that the service there was lovely.  Everything was delivered quickly and with a smile.  However overall I think this place is a bit overrated.  Would I go here for lunch once in a while if I worked nearby, sure.  Would I go out of my way to come here? Probably not.  There are so many other cafes in this area with incredible cappuccinos and pastries at almost half the cost and half the crowds. The best cuban sandwich in Montreal according to me.  And the best in North America, according to Anthony Bourdain. In fact, all sandwiches are pretty awesome.  But how to resist O+G's sandwich filled with gooey gruyère, ham, pork loin and their secret sauce? Feeling a bit more healthy? The "24" salad with asian flavors is a good choice too. And how to resist their beautiful selection of baked desserts?Did I say how I love O+G ? Try it, you won't be disappointed. This place gets 5 stars from me, at least from the breakfast standpoint.  We came here because it was a highly recommended spot located in Old Montreal, and we wanted to try it out.  For breakfast I had a coffee, and the granola.  The granola is amazing it comes with yoghurt and a bunch of different types of fruit.  It was delicious.  I also had a chocolate and banana pastry which was super yummy as well. This place is very busy but we were seated and served pretty quickly.  I really liked this place and would totally come here again. Came here on Saturday for lunch around 12pm.  The host told us it would be a 25-30 minute wait, but when we came back around 12:30pm, he told us another 25 minutes, so that was pretty annoying that the estimated timing was wayyy off, but we got coffee at a nearby café so that was fine.  They also serve coffee and pastries in the takeout line, so that's nice to have while you wait. The place itself is very cozy and cute.  We sat on a communal table and I ordered a Goat Cheese and Onion Panini and a raspberry lemonade.  The Panini came with a homemade ketchup which was thinned out ketchup that was sweet but still tangy - it complemented the sandwich perfectly.  I couldn't finish the whole Panini by myself.  My friends ordered the Cuban sandwich and the Cajun Chicken Sandwich, which they all enjoyed.  Great to share the Paninis with friends for some variation in your overall meal.  I was sad to hear that they ran out of the egg in your face Panini -- I really wanted to try that!The service was pretty quick as all the sandwiches were premade, which I thought it was odd, considering sandwiches are pretty quick to make, but I was happy with our overall meal. Located in Old Montreal but was a really good restaurant!! I came there twice because the Cuba panini was only on lunch menu.  It deserves visiting again. My friend and I had two divine brioches for breakfast.  My chocolate and banana one was the best of the world! Too much chocolate inside! Not too sweet but very crispy.  Soooo nice~ The Cuba panini was crunchy outside and gooey inside.  Melting cheese with bacon and salty turkey, never forgot.  Because it was the last meal in Montreal. The staff were all very pretty and friendly.  Love the ambience and decoration of the restaurant.  The price was reasonable. From the ratings to the many reviews on here, it's as good as it gets so I won't repeat the others, but a few of my own tips and observations:Let me preface that I was just visiting Montreal for the weekend, first time in the city. I came here essentially to get that Eggs In Yo Face (I'm sure you know what I mean) breakfast sandwich.   Note: The place currently opens at 9 am (on Saturdays).   From reading blogs, it suggested we get there at 8:30, we arrived at 8:40 to a closed restaurant.  We walked around and came back at 9:04 and already there was a line.  Luckily we managed to snag some seats at the high table though so definitely come early, this place is as popular as they say! I asked if I could get the sandwich without cheese - DENIED.   Said the cheese was already pre-mixed into the eggs.   I decided to chance it.  I've hated cheese my entire life, I've become quite adept at picking out cheese from food.   And glad I did, because all I had to do was open the sandwich and not eat the side on which the cheese was melted.  The rest was delicious and cheese free (uhm. . . but this also means the cheese could have easily been left out but. . . . whatever).   I asked for a knife and fork from a passing waitress (crucial tools in my cheese extraction). . . who reluctantly gave them to me with this request: "please be careful of the plates when  using the knife and fork, the plates scratch easily and can also break if you press too hard" - uhm.  really? I need to be careful of breaking plates. . . . . at a restaurant. . . . . with my utensils?  Sounds like someone bought some useless plates.  They were very pretty though. So why 5 stars for a place that refused me to go cheeseless and warns you of heavy utensil use? Cuz the food is delicious! Really, go and get the sandwich.  I miss it already.  Also the vibe is great.  Lovely cozy spot perfect for breakfast to fuel you up for a day of sightseeing.  Also, our main server (male) was great, super nice and friendly and overall we had a great meal.  Approx $70 Canadian (including tip) for 2 sandwiches, 1 fruit bowl, 1 pastry, 2 coffees and 2 very fresh squeezed orange juice for a party of 3. Olive & Gourmando is located in Old Montreal on Saint Paul.  It is just a couple of blocks off of the river near the old port. As other yelpers have written the place does a brisk business, mainly with the tourist trade.  However, Olive & Gourmand is a pretty good place for fresh baked goods, good coffee and an excellent brunch.  We had about a 20-minute wait for our table for 3. The food we had was all very fresh and had nice flavors.  I had the Goat Cheese Sandwich (Mild goat cheese paillot and caramelized onions.  Served with their house made ketchup) and it was excellent.  We also had coffee and some really special baked goods. The prices are not too bad either being in the heart of the tourist district.  Our server was really nice also. Every time I set foot in here for breakfast (or lunch), I'm always pleased with the food quality, the excellent & friend service and the eclectic and welcoming decor!You'll often hear patrons of Olive & Gourmand complimenting them on the "concept". . .  interesting because when you ask veteran Marie-Helene and Sandra, or "old crusts" as they jokingly call themselves, there is no concept.  It's just the result  of a slow evolution of bringing goodness and joy to people, season after season. The hustle and bustle can perhaps turn off some people who prefer quietness when sipping their café but if you're like me and love the vibe, the energy, the possibility of striking serendipitous conversations with locals or out-of-towners, and the soothing humming of the hustle & bustle this iconic place delivers then you're in for happy times!Whether you're vegan, vegetarian, or a carnivore (me), Olive & Gourmando redefines what wholesome, homemade food should be. What a beautiful, cozy place! The food is delicious; the salads and sandwiches are always my choice and the pastry are just perfect for my usual cappuccino! I love the vibe of the place; the moment you take your seat at the table, the day becomes better, surrounded with those beautiful smells of coffee and toasted bread and muffins :)The service is perfect, it always comes with a smile and with the answers and suggestions you need!The-best-place in Montreal for breakfast and brunch.  Oh wow, I still remember the taste of their numerous and beautiful pastries I tried with my boyfriend.  Flaky, buttery, fruity deliciousness in buns, croissants, danishes and donuts.  Everything was delicious and I wish I tried everything else.  Place was super busy when we got there so we grabbed food to go instead.  Get there early if you want to sit down or be prepare to wait. Outstanding bakery. Excellent for breakfast or lunch.   Salad and  sandwich listings are a bit limited, but you are bound to find something you like.   The baked products are some of the best I have tasted.   The lines can be long on the weekend. . . so get there expecting to wait. Service: Great, though we had to wait for about 20 min.  It was a Saturday afternoon around 4 pm.  This may be why it was so busy. Food: Really excellent.  My date had an excellent sandwich and my salad was delicious.  Everything was local and organic, always a plus in my book. Atmosphere: Really loud, but cool and trendy. Pricing: Slightly overpriced, but when you consider the quality of the ingredients, it may be the right price-point. I love how this place feels! Very cozy and hipster - you'll know what I mean.  The staff was very organized despite the place being very busy.  We were given a place all the way in the back corner of the shop and I was worried that we would be forgotten - we weren't.  If you ever wanted to try that increasingly popular 1642 Montreal Cola, then look no further.  I tried the grilled Cuban panini and it was good - crunchy and cheesy.  The habibi chicken, in my opinion, was better.  Anything tastes good with garlic, pickles, and dill.  Also there are vegetarian and vegan options if you're not a meat eater. If you're passing nearby the Old Port then you should definitely come by this place. Good, but pricey and a little strange.  We waited for about 45 minutes for a table for two, so obviously this place is popular.  You are packed in, basically sitting shoulder to shoulder with the person next to you.  We got fussed at for putting our jackets in the window sill (a little strange), so we had jackets piled on the backs of our chairs.  I ordered the Cuban, which was delicious, but pricey at over $10 without any sides.  I asked for a side of chips, and all they have are full size bags of chips made for multiple people. . .  So it became close to $20 for a sandwich and chips.  Like I said, the food was delicious, but it's pricey for what you get and you don't have much space. TREAT YO SELF.

The pesto mayo made this dish! The mixed salad sounds so simple but it was SO good, the toasted almonds and the chopped chicken gave this salad the kick it didn't even need.  I loved how light but tasty the dressing was.  I wanted to come back the next day to have the same meal again, even though I don't like visiting the same restaurant twice while on vacation.  It was that good. This place isn't overrated or as pretentious as it sounds or looks - go check it out!Looking for a good cup of coffee and pastry, my doorman recommended this place - and he was right, it is fantastic! The place is small and every table was full with a wait.  I just grabbed a late and croissant to go.  The late was made perfectly.  Oh, and the croissant. . . oh la la! It did remind me of Paris. I think I definitely worked this place up in my head by reading all the reviews and then was a bit disappointed.  Don't get me wrong the food is good and the quality of the ingredients is great.  But is it worth the price, the wait and sitting shoulder to shoulder cramped with other guests. . . probably not.  I've been here twice.  Once for take out and once for a sit down meal.  For take out I ordered the banana chocolate brioche and a cappuccino.  It was good.  The pastry was delicious.  However I think the tiny cappuccinos are quite overpriced and nothing special.  For the sit down meal I got there at 10:40 am and it wasn't too busy.  I tried to order the 'in your face egg panini' which they were sold out of.  How do you sell out of eggs and bread at a breakfast place by 10:40? It wasn't a big deal, but it made a difference since their menu is already very small and limited.  I also noticed it's a trend in the other reviews.  Anyways I ordered the ricotta with honey and bread and an almond croissant.  Both were delicious.  The ricotta is creamy and refreshing.  The almond croissant is good but overpriced in my opinion.  I do have to say that the service there was lovely.  Everything was delivered quickly and with a smile.  However overall I think this place is a bit overrated.  Would I go here for lunch once in a while if I worked nearby, sure.  Would I go out of my way to come here? Probably not.  There are so many other cafes in this area with incredible cappuccinos and pastries at almost half the cost and half the crowds. The best cuban sandwich in Montreal according to me.  And the best in North America, according to Anthony Bourdain. In fact, all sandwiches are pretty awesome.  But how to resist O+G's sandwich filled with gooey gruyère, ham, pork loin and their secret sauce? Feeling a bit more healthy? The "24" salad with asian flavors is a good choice too. And how to resist their beautiful selection of baked desserts?Did I say how I love O+G ? Try it, you won't be disappointed. This place gets 5 stars from me, at least from the breakfast standpoint.  We came here because it was a highly recommended spot located in Old Montreal, and we wanted to try it out.  For breakfast I had a coffee, and the granola.  The granola is amazing it comes with yoghurt and a bunch of different types of fruit.  It was delicious.  I also had a chocolate and banana pastry which was super yummy as well. This place is very busy but we were seated and served pretty quickly.  I really liked this place and would totally come here again. Came here on Saturday for lunch around 12pm.  The host told us it would be a 25-30 minute wait, but when we came back around 12:30pm, he told us another 25 minutes, so that was pretty annoying that the estimated timing was wayyy off, but we got coffee at a nearby café so that was fine.  They also serve coffee and pastries in the takeout line, so that's nice to have while you wait. The place itself is very cozy and cute.  We sat on a communal table and I ordered a Goat Cheese and Onion Panini and a raspberry lemonade.  The Panini came with a homemade ketchup which was thinned out ketchup that was sweet but still tangy - it complemented the sandwich perfectly.  I couldn't finish the whole Panini by myself.  My friends ordered the Cuban sandwich and the Cajun Chicken Sandwich, which they all enjoyed.  Great to share the Paninis with friends for some variation in your overall meal.  I was sad to hear that they ran out of the egg in your face Panini -- I really wanted to try that!The service was pretty quick as all the sandwiches were premade, which I thought it was odd, considering sandwiches are pretty quick to make, but I was happy with our overall meal. Located in Old Montreal but was a really good restaurant!! I came there twice because the Cuba panini was only on lunch menu.  It deserves visiting again. My friend and I had two divine brioches for breakfast.  My chocolate and banana one was the best of the world! Too much chocolate inside! Not too sweet but very crispy.  Soooo nice~ The Cuba panini was crunchy outside and gooey inside.  Melting cheese with bacon and salty turkey, never forgot.  Because it was the last meal in Montreal. The staff were all very pretty and friendly.  Love the ambience and decoration of the restaurant.  The price was reasonable. From the ratings to the many reviews on here, it's as good as it gets so I won't repeat the others, but a few of my own tips and observations:Let me preface that I was just visiting Montreal for the weekend, first time in the city. I came here essentially to get that Eggs In Yo Face (I'm sure you know what I mean) breakfast sandwich.   Note: The place currently opens at 9 am (on Saturdays).   From reading blogs, it suggested we get there at 8:30, we arrived at 8:40 to a closed restaurant.  We walked around and came back at 9:04 and already there was a line.  Luckily we managed to snag some seats at the high table though so definitely come early, this place is as popular as they say! I asked if I could get the sandwich without cheese - DENIED.   Said the cheese was already pre-mixed into the eggs.   I decided to chance it.  I've hated cheese my entire life, I've become quite adept at picking out cheese from food.   And glad I did, because all I had to do was open the sandwich and not eat the side on which the cheese was melted.  The rest was delicious and cheese free (uhm. . . but this also means the cheese could have easily been left out but. . . . whatever).   I asked for a knife and fork from a passing waitress (crucial tools in my cheese extraction). . . who reluctantly gave them to me with this request: "please be careful of the plates when  using the knife and fork, the plates scratch easily and can also break if you press too hard" - uhm.  really? I need to be careful of breaking plates. . . . . at a restaurant. . . . . with my utensils?  Sounds like someone bought some useless plates.  They were very pretty though. So why 5 stars for a place that refused me to go cheeseless and warns you of heavy utensil use? Cuz the food is delicious! Really, go and get the sandwich.  I miss it already.  Also the vibe is great.  Lovely cozy spot perfect for breakfast to fuel you up for a day of sightseeing.  Also, our main server (male) was great, super nice and friendly and overall we had a great meal.  Approx $70 Canadian (including tip) for 2 sandwiches, 1 fruit bowl, 1 pastry, 2 coffees and 2 very fresh squeezed orange juice for a party of 3. Olive & Gourmando is located in Old Montreal on Saint Paul.  It is just a couple of blocks off of the river near the old port. As other yelpers have written the place does a brisk business, mainly with the tourist trade.  However, Olive & Gourmand is a pretty good place for fresh baked goods, good coffee and an excellent brunch.  We had about a 20-minute wait for our table for 3. The food we had was all very fresh and had nice flavors.  I had the Goat Cheese Sandwich (Mild goat cheese paillot and caramelized onions.  Served with their house made ketchup) and it was excellent.  We also had coffee and some really special baked goods. The prices are not too bad either being in the heart of the tourist district.  Our server was really nice also. Every time I set foot in here for breakfast (or lunch), I'm always pleased with the food quality, the excellent & friend service and the eclectic and welcoming decor!You'll often hear patrons of Olive & Gourmand complimenting them on the "concept". . .  interesting because when you ask veteran Marie-Helene and Sandra, or "old crusts" as they jokingly call themselves, there is no concept.  It's just the result  of a slow evolution of bringing goodness and joy to people, season after season. The hustle and bustle can perhaps turn off some people who prefer quietness when sipping their café but if you're like me and love the vibe, the energy, the possibility of striking serendipitous conversations with locals or out-of-towners, and the soothing humming of the hustle & bustle this iconic place delivers then you're in for happy times!Whether you're vegan, vegetarian, or a carnivore (me), Olive & Gourmando redefines what wholesome, homemade food should be. What a beautiful, cozy place! The food is delicious; the salads and sandwiches are always my choice and the pastry are just perfect for my usual cappuccino! I love the vibe of the place; the moment you take your seat at the table, the day becomes better, surrounded with those beautiful smells of coffee and toasted bread and muffins :)The service is perfect, it always comes with a smile and with the answers and suggestions you need!The-best-place in Montreal for breakfast and brunch.  Oh wow, I still remember the taste of their numerous and beautiful pastries I tried with my boyfriend.  Flaky, buttery, fruity deliciousness in buns, croissants, danishes and donuts.  Everything was delicious and I wish I tried everything else.  Place was super busy when we got there so we grabbed food to go instead.  Get there early if you want to sit down or be prepare to wait. Outstanding bakery. Excellent for breakfast or lunch.   Salad and  sandwich listings are a bit limited, but you are bound to find something you like.   The baked products are some of the best I have tasted.   The lines can be long on the weekend. . . so get there expecting to wait. Service: Great, though we had to wait for about 20 min.  It was a Saturday afternoon around 4 pm.  This may be why it was so busy. Food: Really excellent.  My date had an excellent sandwich and my salad was delicious.  Everything was local and organic, always a plus in my book. Atmosphere: Really loud, but cool and trendy. Pricing: Slightly overpriced, but when you consider the quality of the ingredients, it may be the right price-point. I love how this place feels! Very cozy and hipster - you'll know what I mean.  The staff was very organized despite the place being very busy.  We were given a place all the way in the back corner of the shop and I was worried that we would be forgotten - we weren't.  If you ever wanted to try that increasingly popular 1642 Montreal Cola, then look no further.  I tried the grilled Cuban panini and it was good - crunchy and cheesy.  The habibi chicken, in my opinion, was better.  Anything tastes good with garlic, pickles, and dill.  Also there are vegetarian and vegan options if you're not a meat eater. If you're passing nearby the Old Port then you should definitely come by this place. Good, but pricey and a little strange.  We waited for about 45 minutes for a table for two, so obviously this place is popular.  You are packed in, basically sitting shoulder to shoulder with the person next to you.  We got fussed at for putting our jackets in the window sill (a little strange), so we had jackets piled on the backs of our chairs.  I ordered the Cuban, which was delicious, but pricey at over $10 without any sides.  I asked for a side of chips, and all they have are full size bags of chips made for multiple people. . .  So it became close to $20 for a sandwich and chips.  Like I said, the food was delicious, but it's pricey for what you get and you don't have much space. TREAT YO SELF.  This place is worth the AMAZING food.  I was in Montreal for a total of 24 hrs & this place was recommended to me by a friend.  I do not speak French.  At.  All.  The waiter was so patient with me & did his best to explain the specials of the day.  He ended up just simplifying the day's soup to "chicken noodle soup" & also recommended one of the sandwiches.  I felt so bad after.  The soup was amazinggggg it did not deserve to be simplified to a mere chicken noodle soup & for that I'm so sorry.  It was so good.  The sandwich was such a large portion & so great, I had half & saved the other half for later.  It's also located in old Montreal, which is such a great place to walk around & take in the old architecture.  Completely recommend!!I absolutely love this place.  I was there years ago but still remember how quaint and cozy and warming this place was.  The service was super friendly and the food was on par.  I'm planning on going back next year and this is my first stop when I go back. This place came highly recommended to me.  I was visiting Montreal for the first time, and I was told that this cafe had the best coffee and baked goods.  There was an off-hand mention of the "beautiful but ill-tempered" employees but I glossed over it.  MISTAKE. We arrived and were seated promptly.  Upon attempting to order, we discovered they were out of nearly everything we wanted.  It was around 11am, and they told us they were out of coffee and the first two sandwiches I tried to order.  I work as a waitress in a restaurant.  I understand that it is not the fault of the waiters that items run out.  However, the rude, irritated attitude of the waiter was uncalled for.  If your menu is only 10-12 items long and 2 of them are sold out, you should tell people before they survey the menu.  Or apologize for the inconvenience.  I tried to order a third sandwich modified without mushroom, which I was told was not possible.  I ended up ordering the vegan sandwich. The sandwich was excellent. That being said, the overall experience was so poor that I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  There are plenty of other restaurants in Montreal with exceptional food and good service. Popped in toward the end of their brunch and it was still pretty crowded, but we managed to snag a table for two by one of their cute little windows. The space is great.  Chalkboards with doodles and menu items cover the walls and the cute cafe by the entrance has some goodies for sale.  The space gets crowded quick but it's a lively atmosphere.  In the summer, there's no AC but thank the heavens this is a corner location and the open air windows let in a slight breeze. Once seated, our server informed us a lot of the menu items are done for the day since its the end of brunch but the options left sounded just as delightful.

The granola is amazing it comes with yoghurt and a bunch of different types of fruit.  It was delicious.  I also had a chocolate and banana pastry which was super yummy as well. This place is very busy but we were seated and served pretty quickly.  I really liked this place and would totally come here again. Came here on Saturday for lunch around 12pm.  The host told us it would be a 25-30 minute wait, but when we came back around 12:30pm, he told us another 25 minutes, so that was pretty annoying that the estimated timing was wayyy off, but we got coffee at a nearby café so that was fine.  They also serve coffee and pastries in the takeout line, so that's nice to have while you wait. The place itself is very cozy and cute.  We sat on a communal table and I ordered a Goat Cheese and Onion Panini and a raspberry lemonade.  The Panini came with a homemade ketchup which was thinned out ketchup that was sweet but still tangy - it complemented the sandwich perfectly.  I couldn't finish the whole Panini by myself.  My friends ordered the Cuban sandwich and the Cajun Chicken Sandwich, which they all enjoyed.  Great to share the Paninis with friends for some variation in your overall meal.  I was sad to hear that they ran out of the egg in your face Panini -- I really wanted to try that!The service was pretty quick as all the sandwiches were premade, which I thought it was odd, considering sandwiches are pretty quick to make, but I was happy with our overall meal. Located in Old Montreal but was a really good restaurant!! I came there twice because the Cuba panini was only on lunch menu.  It deserves visiting again. My friend and I had two divine brioches for breakfast.  My chocolate and banana one was the best of the world! Too much chocolate inside! Not too sweet but very crispy.  Soooo nice~ The Cuba panini was crunchy outside and gooey inside.  Melting cheese with bacon and salty turkey, never forgot.  Because it was the last meal in Montreal. The staff were all very pretty and friendly.  Love the ambience and decoration of the restaurant.  The price was reasonable. From the ratings to the many reviews on here, it's as good as it gets so I won't repeat the others, but a few of my own tips and observations:Let me preface that I was just visiting Montreal for the weekend, first time in the city. I came here essentially to get that Eggs In Yo Face (I'm sure you know what I mean) breakfast sandwich.   Note: The place currently opens at 9 am (on Saturdays).   From reading blogs, it suggested we get there at 8:30, we arrived at 8:40 to a closed restaurant.  We walked around and came back at 9:04 and already there was a line.  Luckily we managed to snag some seats at the high table though so definitely come early, this place is as popular as they say! I asked if I could get the sandwich without cheese - DENIED.   Said the cheese was already pre-mixed into the eggs.   I decided to chance it.  I've hated cheese my entire life, I've become quite adept at picking out cheese from food.   And glad I did, because all I had to do was open the sandwich and not eat the side on which the cheese was melted.  The rest was delicious and cheese free (uhm. . . but this also means the cheese could have easily been left out but. . . . whatever).   I asked for a knife and fork from a passing waitress (crucial tools in my cheese extraction). . . who reluctantly gave them to me with this request: "please be careful of the plates when  using the knife and fork, the plates scratch easily and can also break if you press too hard" - uhm.  really? I need to be careful of breaking plates. . . . . at a restaurant. . . . . with my utensils?  Sounds like someone bought some useless plates.  They were very pretty though. So why 5 stars for a place that refused me to go cheeseless and warns you of heavy utensil use? Cuz the food is delicious! Really, go and get the sandwich.  I miss it already.  Also the vibe is great.  Lovely cozy spot perfect for breakfast to fuel you up for a day of sightseeing.  Also, our main server (male) was great, super nice and friendly and overall we had a great meal.  Approx $70 Canadian (including tip) for 2 sandwiches, 1 fruit bowl, 1 pastry, 2 coffees and 2 very fresh squeezed orange juice for a party of 3. Olive & Gourmando is located in Old Montreal on Saint Paul.  It is just a couple of blocks off of the river near the old port. As other yelpers have written the place does a brisk business, mainly with the tourist trade.  However, Olive & Gourmand is a pretty good place for fresh baked goods, good coffee and an excellent brunch.  We had about a 20-minute wait for our table for 3. The food we had was all very fresh and had nice flavors.  I had the Goat Cheese Sandwich (Mild goat cheese paillot and caramelized onions.  Served with their house made ketchup) and it was excellent.  We also had coffee and some really special baked goods. The prices are not too bad either being in the heart of the tourist district.  Our server was really nice also. Every time I set foot in here for breakfast (or lunch), I'm always pleased with the food quality, the excellent & friend service and the eclectic and welcoming decor!You'll often hear patrons of Olive & Gourmand complimenting them on the "concept". . .  interesting because when you ask veteran Marie-Helene and Sandra, or "old crusts" as they jokingly call themselves, there is no concept.  It's just the result  of a slow evolution of bringing goodness and joy to people, season after season. The hustle and bustle can perhaps turn off some people who prefer quietness when sipping their café but if you're like me and love the vibe, the energy, the possibility of striking serendipitous conversations with locals or out-of-towners, and the soothing humming of the hustle & bustle this iconic place delivers then you're in for happy times!Whether you're vegan, vegetarian, or a carnivore (me), Olive & Gourmando redefines what wholesome, homemade food should be. What a beautiful, cozy place! The food is delicious; the salads and sandwiches are always my choice and the pastry are just perfect for my usual cappuccino! I love the vibe of the place; the moment you take your seat at the table, the day becomes better, surrounded with those beautiful smells of coffee and toasted bread and muffins :)The service is perfect, it always comes with a smile and with the answers and suggestions you need!The-best-place in Montreal for breakfast and brunch.  Oh wow, I still remember the taste of their numerous and beautiful pastries I tried with my boyfriend.  Flaky, buttery, fruity deliciousness in buns, croissants, danishes and donuts.  Everything was delicious and I wish I tried everything else.  Place was super busy when we got there so we grabbed food to go instead.  Get there early if you want to sit down or be prepare to wait. Outstanding bakery. Excellent for breakfast or lunch.   Salad and  sandwich listings are a bit limited, but you are bound to find something you like.   The baked products are some of the best I have tasted.   The lines can be long on the weekend. . . so get there expecting to wait. Service: Great, though we had to wait for about 20 min.  It was a Saturday afternoon around 4 pm.  This may be why it was so busy. Food: Really excellent.  My date had an excellent sandwich and my salad was delicious.  Everything was local and organic, always a plus in my book. Atmosphere: Really loud, but cool and trendy. Pricing: Slightly overpriced, but when you consider the quality of the ingredients, it may be the right price-point. I love how this place feels! Very cozy and hipster - you'll know what I mean.  The staff was very organized despite the place being very busy.  We were given a place all the way in the back corner of the shop and I was worried that we would be forgotten - we weren't.  If you ever wanted to try that increasingly popular 1642 Montreal Cola, then look no further.  I tried the grilled Cuban panini and it was good - crunchy and cheesy.  The habibi chicken, in my opinion, was better.  Anything tastes good with garlic, pickles, and dill.  Also there are vegetarian and vegan options if you're not a meat eater. If you're passing nearby the Old Port then you should definitely come by this place. Good, but pricey and a little strange.  We waited for about 45 minutes for a table for two, so obviously this place is popular.  You are packed in, basically sitting shoulder to shoulder with the person next to you.  We got fussed at for putting our jackets in the window sill (a little strange), so we had jackets piled on the backs of our chairs.  I ordered the Cuban, which was delicious, but pricey at over $10 without any sides.  I asked for a side of chips, and all they have are full size bags of chips made for multiple people. . .  So it became close to $20 for a sandwich and chips.  Like I said, the food was delicious, but it's pricey for what you get and you don't have much space. TREAT YO SELF.  This place is worth the AMAZING food.  I was in Montreal for a total of 24 hrs & this place was recommended to me by a friend.  I do not speak French.  At.  All.  The waiter was so patient with me & did his best to explain the specials of the day.  He ended up just simplifying the day's soup to "chicken noodle soup" & also recommended one of the sandwiches.  I felt so bad after.  The soup was amazinggggg it did not deserve to be simplified to a mere chicken noodle soup & for that I'm so sorry.  It was so good.  The sandwich was such a large portion & so great, I had half & saved the other half for later.  It's also located in old Montreal, which is such a great place to walk around & take in the old architecture.  Completely recommend!!I absolutely love this place.  I was there years ago but still remember how quaint and cozy and warming this place was.  The service was super friendly and the food was on par.  I'm planning on going back next year and this is my first stop when I go back. This place came highly recommended to me.  I was visiting Montreal for the first time, and I was told that this cafe had the best coffee and baked goods.  There was an off-hand mention of the "beautiful but ill-tempered" employees but I glossed over it.  MISTAKE. We arrived and were seated promptly.  Upon attempting to order, we discovered they were out of nearly everything we wanted.  It was around 11am, and they told us they were out of coffee and the first two sandwiches I tried to order.  I work as a waitress in a restaurant.  I understand that it is not the fault of the waiters that items run out.  However, the rude, irritated attitude of the waiter was uncalled for.  If your menu is only 10-12 items long and 2 of them are sold out, you should tell people before they survey the menu.  Or apologize for the inconvenience.  I tried to order a third sandwich modified without mushroom, which I was told was not possible.  I ended up ordering the vegan sandwich. The sandwich was excellent. That being said, the overall experience was so poor that I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  There are plenty of other restaurants in Montreal with exceptional food and good service. Popped in toward the end of their brunch and it was still pretty crowded, but we managed to snag a table for two by one of their cute little windows. The space is great.  Chalkboards with doodles and menu items cover the walls and the cute cafe by the entrance has some goodies for sale.  The space gets crowded quick but it's a lively atmosphere.  In the summer, there's no AC but thank the heavens this is a corner location and the open air windows let in a slight breeze. Once seated, our server informed us a lot of the menu items are done for the day since its the end of brunch but the options left sounded just as delightful.  I had the mixed salad with chicken and my boyfriend had the Cuban sandwich.  Both were SPECTACULAR.  Although it was a different take on a classic, this was probably the best Cuban I've ever tried.  The pesto mayo made this dish! The mixed salad sounds so simple but it was SO good, the toasted almonds and the chopped chicken gave this salad the kick it didn't even need.  I loved how light but tasty the dressing was.  I wanted to come back the next day to have the same meal again, even though I don't like visiting the same restaurant twice while on vacation.  It was that good. This place isn't overrated or as pretentious as it sounds or looks - go check it out!Looking for a good cup of coffee and pastry, my doorman recommended this place - and he was right, it is fantastic! The place is small and every table was full with a wait.  I just grabbed a late and croissant to go.  The late was made perfectly.  Oh, and the croissant. . . oh la la! It did remind me of Paris. I think I definitely worked this place up in my head by reading all the reviews and then was a bit disappointed.  Don't get me wrong the food is good and the quality of the ingredients is great.  But is it worth the price, the wait and sitting shoulder to shoulder cramped with other guests. . . probably not.  I've been here twice.  Once for take out and once for a sit down meal.  For take out I ordered the banana chocolate brioche and a cappuccino.  It was good.  The pastry was delicious.  However I think the tiny cappuccinos are quite overpriced and nothing special.  For the sit down meal I got there at 10:40 am and it wasn't too busy.  I tried to order the 'in your face egg panini' which they were sold out of.  How do you sell out of eggs and bread at a breakfast place by 10:40? It wasn't a big deal, but it made a difference since their menu is already very small and limited.  I also noticed it's a trend in the other reviews.  Anyways I ordered the ricotta with honey and bread and an almond croissant.  Both were delicious.  The ricotta is creamy and refreshing.  The almond croissant is good but overpriced in my opinion.  I do have to say that the service there was lovely.  Everything was delivered quickly and with a smile.  However overall I think this place is a bit overrated.  Would I go here for lunch once in a while if I worked nearby, sure.  Would I go out of my way to come here? Probably not.  There are so many other cafes in this area with incredible cappuccinos and pastries at almost half the cost and half the crowds. The best cuban sandwich in Montreal according to me.  And the best in North America, according to Anthony Bourdain. In fact, all sandwiches are pretty awesome.  But how to resist O+G's sandwich filled with gooey gruyère, ham, pork loin and their secret sauce? Feeling a bit more healthy? The "24" salad with asian flavors is a good choice too. And how to resist their beautiful selection of baked desserts?Did I say how I love O+G ? Try it, you won't be disappointed. This place gets 5 stars from me, at least from the breakfast standpoint.  We came here because it was a highly recommended spot located in Old Montreal, and we wanted to try it out.  For breakfast I had a coffee, and the granola.

I've hated cheese my entire life, I've become quite adept at picking out cheese from food.   And glad I did, because all I had to do was open the sandwich and not eat the side on which the cheese was melted.  The rest was delicious and cheese free (uhm. . . but this also means the cheese could have easily been left out but. . . . whatever).   I asked for a knife and fork from a passing waitress (crucial tools in my cheese extraction). . . who reluctantly gave them to me with this request: "please be careful of the plates when  using the knife and fork, the plates scratch easily and can also break if you press too hard" - uhm.  really? I need to be careful of breaking plates. . . . . at a restaurant. . . . . with my utensils?  Sounds like someone bought some useless plates.  They were very pretty though. So why 5 stars for a place that refused me to go cheeseless and warns you of heavy utensil use? Cuz the food is delicious! Really, go and get the sandwich.  I miss it already.  Also the vibe is great.  Lovely cozy spot perfect for breakfast to fuel you up for a day of sightseeing.  Also, our main server (male) was great, super nice and friendly and overall we had a great meal.  Approx $70 Canadian (including tip) for 2 sandwiches, 1 fruit bowl, 1 pastry, 2 coffees and 2 very fresh squeezed orange juice for a party of 3. Olive & Gourmando is located in Old Montreal on Saint Paul.  It is just a couple of blocks off of the river near the old port. As other yelpers have written the place does a brisk business, mainly with the tourist trade.  However, Olive & Gourmand is a pretty good place for fresh baked goods, good coffee and an excellent brunch.  We had about a 20-minute wait for our table for 3. The food we had was all very fresh and had nice flavors.  I had the Goat Cheese Sandwich (Mild goat cheese paillot and caramelized onions.  Served with their house made ketchup) and it was excellent.  We also had coffee and some really special baked goods. The prices are not too bad either being in the heart of the tourist district.  Our server was really nice also. Every time I set foot in here for breakfast (or lunch), I'm always pleased with the food quality, the excellent & friend service and the eclectic and welcoming decor!You'll often hear patrons of Olive & Gourmand complimenting them on the "concept". . .  interesting because when you ask veteran Marie-Helene and Sandra, or "old crusts" as they jokingly call themselves, there is no concept.  It's just the result  of a slow evolution of bringing goodness and joy to people, season after season. The hustle and bustle can perhaps turn off some people who prefer quietness when sipping their café but if you're like me and love the vibe, the energy, the possibility of striking serendipitous conversations with locals or out-of-towners, and the soothing humming of the hustle & bustle this iconic place delivers then you're in for happy times!Whether you're vegan, vegetarian, or a carnivore (me), Olive & Gourmando redefines what wholesome, homemade food should be. What a beautiful, cozy place! The food is delicious; the salads and sandwiches are always my choice and the pastry are just perfect for my usual cappuccino! I love the vibe of the place; the moment you take your seat at the table, the day becomes better, surrounded with those beautiful smells of coffee and toasted bread and muffins :)The service is perfect, it always comes with a smile and with the answers and suggestions you need!The-best-place in Montreal for breakfast and brunch.  Oh wow, I still remember the taste of their numerous and beautiful pastries I tried with my boyfriend.  Flaky, buttery, fruity deliciousness in buns, croissants, danishes and donuts.  Everything was delicious and I wish I tried everything else.  Place was super busy when we got there so we grabbed food to go instead.  Get there early if you want to sit down or be prepare to wait. Outstanding bakery. Excellent for breakfast or lunch.   Salad and  sandwich listings are a bit limited, but you are bound to find something you like.   The baked products are some of the best I have tasted.   The lines can be long on the weekend. . . so get there expecting to wait. Service: Great, though we had to wait for about 20 min.  It was a Saturday afternoon around 4 pm.  This may be why it was so busy. Food: Really excellent.  My date had an excellent sandwich and my salad was delicious.  Everything was local and organic, always a plus in my book. Atmosphere: Really loud, but cool and trendy. Pricing: Slightly overpriced, but when you consider the quality of the ingredients, it may be the right price-point. I love how this place feels! Very cozy and hipster - you'll know what I mean.  The staff was very organized despite the place being very busy.  We were given a place all the way in the back corner of the shop and I was worried that we would be forgotten - we weren't.  If you ever wanted to try that increasingly popular 1642 Montreal Cola, then look no further.  I tried the grilled Cuban panini and it was good - crunchy and cheesy.  The habibi chicken, in my opinion, was better.  Anything tastes good with garlic, pickles, and dill.  Also there are vegetarian and vegan options if you're not a meat eater. If you're passing nearby the Old Port then you should definitely come by this place. Good, but pricey and a little strange.  We waited for about 45 minutes for a table for two, so obviously this place is popular.  You are packed in, basically sitting shoulder to shoulder with the person next to you.  We got fussed at for putting our jackets in the window sill (a little strange), so we had jackets piled on the backs of our chairs.  I ordered the Cuban, which was delicious, but pricey at over $10 without any sides.  I asked for a side of chips, and all they have are full size bags of chips made for multiple people. . .  So it became close to $20 for a sandwich and chips.  Like I said, the food was delicious, but it's pricey for what you get and you don't have much space. TREAT YO SELF.  This place is worth the AMAZING food.  I was in Montreal for a total of 24 hrs & this place was recommended to me by a friend.  I do not speak French.  At.  All.  The waiter was so patient with me & did his best to explain the specials of the day.  He ended up just simplifying the day's soup to "chicken noodle soup" & also recommended one of the sandwiches.  I felt so bad after.  The soup was amazinggggg it did not deserve to be simplified to a mere chicken noodle soup & for that I'm so sorry.  It was so good.  The sandwich was such a large portion & so great, I had half & saved the other half for later.  It's also located in old Montreal, which is such a great place to walk around & take in the old architecture.  Completely recommend!!I absolutely love this place.  I was there years ago but still remember how quaint and cozy and warming this place was.  The service was super friendly and the food was on par.  I'm planning on going back next year and this is my first stop when I go back. This place came highly recommended to me.  I was visiting Montreal for the first time, and I was told that this cafe had the best coffee and baked goods.  There was an off-hand mention of the "beautiful but ill-tempered" employees but I glossed over it.  MISTAKE. We arrived and were seated promptly.  Upon attempting to order, we discovered they were out of nearly everything we wanted.  It was around 11am, and they told us they were out of coffee and the first two sandwiches I tried to order.  I work as a waitress in a restaurant.  I understand that it is not the fault of the waiters that items run out.  However, the rude, irritated attitude of the waiter was uncalled for.  If your menu is only 10-12 items long and 2 of them are sold out, you should tell people before they survey the menu.  Or apologize for the inconvenience.  I tried to order a third sandwich modified without mushroom, which I was told was not possible.  I ended up ordering the vegan sandwich. The sandwich was excellent. That being said, the overall experience was so poor that I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  There are plenty of other restaurants in Montreal with exceptional food and good service. Popped in toward the end of their brunch and it was still pretty crowded, but we managed to snag a table for two by one of their cute little windows. The space is great.  Chalkboards with doodles and menu items cover the walls and the cute cafe by the entrance has some goodies for sale.  The space gets crowded quick but it's a lively atmosphere.  In the summer, there's no AC but thank the heavens this is a corner location and the open air windows let in a slight breeze. Once seated, our server informed us a lot of the menu items are done for the day since its the end of brunch but the options left sounded just as delightful.  I had the mixed salad with chicken and my boyfriend had the Cuban sandwich.  Both were SPECTACULAR.  Although it was a different take on a classic, this was probably the best Cuban I've ever tried.  The pesto mayo made this dish! The mixed salad sounds so simple but it was SO good, the toasted almonds and the chopped chicken gave this salad the kick it didn't even need.  I loved how light but tasty the dressing was.  I wanted to come back the next day to have the same meal again, even though I don't like visiting the same restaurant twice while on vacation.  It was that good. This place isn't overrated or as pretentious as it sounds or looks - go check it out!Looking for a good cup of coffee and pastry, my doorman recommended this place - and he was right, it is fantastic! The place is small and every table was full with a wait.  I just grabbed a late and croissant to go.  The late was made perfectly.  Oh, and the croissant. . . oh la la! It did remind me of Paris. I think I definitely worked this place up in my head by reading all the reviews and then was a bit disappointed.  Don't get me wrong the food is good and the quality of the ingredients is great.  But is it worth the price, the wait and sitting shoulder to shoulder cramped with other guests. . . probably not.  I've been here twice.  Once for take out and once for a sit down meal.  For take out I ordered the banana chocolate brioche and a cappuccino.  It was good.  The pastry was delicious.  However I think the tiny cappuccinos are quite overpriced and nothing special.  For the sit down meal I got there at 10:40 am and it wasn't too busy.  I tried to order the 'in your face egg panini' which they were sold out of.  How do you sell out of eggs and bread at a breakfast place by 10:40? It wasn't a big deal, but it made a difference since their menu is already very small and limited.  I also noticed it's a trend in the other reviews.  Anyways I ordered the ricotta with honey and bread and an almond croissant.  Both were delicious.  The ricotta is creamy and refreshing.  The almond croissant is good but overpriced in my opinion.  I do have to say that the service there was lovely.  Everything was delivered quickly and with a smile.  However overall I think this place is a bit overrated.  Would I go here for lunch once in a while if I worked nearby, sure.  Would I go out of my way to come here? Probably not.  There are so many other cafes in this area with incredible cappuccinos and pastries at almost half the cost and half the crowds. The best cuban sandwich in Montreal according to me.  And the best in North America, according to Anthony Bourdain. In fact, all sandwiches are pretty awesome.  But how to resist O+G's sandwich filled with gooey gruyère, ham, pork loin and their secret sauce? Feeling a bit more healthy? The "24" salad with asian flavors is a good choice too. And how to resist their beautiful selection of baked desserts?Did I say how I love O+G ? Try it, you won't be disappointed. This place gets 5 stars from me, at least from the breakfast standpoint.  We came here because it was a highly recommended spot located in Old Montreal, and we wanted to try it out.  For breakfast I had a coffee, and the granola.  The granola is amazing it comes with yoghurt and a bunch of different types of fruit.  It was delicious.  I also had a chocolate and banana pastry which was super yummy as well. This place is very busy but we were seated and served pretty quickly.  I really liked this place and would totally come here again. Came here on Saturday for lunch around 12pm.  The host told us it would be a 25-30 minute wait, but when we came back around 12:30pm, he told us another 25 minutes, so that was pretty annoying that the estimated timing was wayyy off, but we got coffee at a nearby café so that was fine.  They also serve coffee and pastries in the takeout line, so that's nice to have while you wait. The place itself is very cozy and cute.  We sat on a communal table and I ordered a Goat Cheese and Onion Panini and a raspberry lemonade.  The Panini came with a homemade ketchup which was thinned out ketchup that was sweet but still tangy - it complemented the sandwich perfectly.  I couldn't finish the whole Panini by myself.  My friends ordered the Cuban sandwich and the Cajun Chicken Sandwich, which they all enjoyed.  Great to share the Paninis with friends for some variation in your overall meal.  I was sad to hear that they ran out of the egg in your face Panini -- I really wanted to try that!The service was pretty quick as all the sandwiches were premade, which I thought it was odd, considering sandwiches are pretty quick to make, but I was happy with our overall meal. Located in Old Montreal but was a really good restaurant!! I came there twice because the Cuba panini was only on lunch menu.  It deserves visiting again. My friend and I had two divine brioches for breakfast.  My chocolate and banana one was the best of the world! Too much chocolate inside! Not too sweet but very crispy.  Soooo nice~ The Cuba panini was crunchy outside and gooey inside.  Melting cheese with bacon and salty turkey, never forgot.  Because it was the last meal in Montreal. The staff were all very pretty and friendly.  Love the ambience and decoration of the restaurant.  The price was reasonable. From the ratings to the many reviews on here, it's as good as it gets so I won't repeat the others, but a few of my own tips and observations:Let me preface that I was just visiting Montreal for the weekend, first time in the city. I came here essentially to get that Eggs In Yo Face (I'm sure you know what I mean) breakfast sandwich.   Note: The place currently opens at 9 am (on Saturdays).   From reading blogs, it suggested we get there at 8:30, we arrived at 8:40 to a closed restaurant.

What a beautiful, cozy place! The food is delicious; the salads and sandwiches are always my choice and the pastry are just perfect for my usual cappuccino! I love the vibe of the place; the moment you take your seat at the table, the day becomes better, surrounded with those beautiful smells of coffee and toasted bread and muffins :)The service is perfect, it always comes with a smile and with the answers and suggestions you need!The-best-place in Montreal for breakfast and brunch.  Oh wow, I still remember the taste of their numerous and beautiful pastries I tried with my boyfriend.  Flaky, buttery, fruity deliciousness in buns, croissants, danishes and donuts.  Everything was delicious and I wish I tried everything else.  Place was super busy when we got there so we grabbed food to go instead.  Get there early if you want to sit down or be prepare to wait. Outstanding bakery. Excellent for breakfast or lunch.   Salad and  sandwich listings are a bit limited, but you are bound to find something you like.   The baked products are some of the best I have tasted.   The lines can be long on the weekend. . . so get there expecting to wait. Service: Great, though we had to wait for about 20 min.  It was a Saturday afternoon around 4 pm.  This may be why it was so busy. Food: Really excellent.  My date had an excellent sandwich and my salad was delicious.  Everything was local and organic, always a plus in my book. Atmosphere: Really loud, but cool and trendy. Pricing: Slightly overpriced, but when you consider the quality of the ingredients, it may be the right price-point. I love how this place feels! Very cozy and hipster - you'll know what I mean.  The staff was very organized despite the place being very busy.  We were given a place all the way in the back corner of the shop and I was worried that we would be forgotten - we weren't.  If you ever wanted to try that increasingly popular 1642 Montreal Cola, then look no further.  I tried the grilled Cuban panini and it was good - crunchy and cheesy.  The habibi chicken, in my opinion, was better.  Anything tastes good with garlic, pickles, and dill.  Also there are vegetarian and vegan options if you're not a meat eater. If you're passing nearby the Old Port then you should definitely come by this place. Good, but pricey and a little strange.  We waited for about 45 minutes for a table for two, so obviously this place is popular.  You are packed in, basically sitting shoulder to shoulder with the person next to you.  We got fussed at for putting our jackets in the window sill (a little strange), so we had jackets piled on the backs of our chairs.  I ordered the Cuban, which was delicious, but pricey at over $10 without any sides.  I asked for a side of chips, and all they have are full size bags of chips made for multiple people. . .  So it became close to $20 for a sandwich and chips.  Like I said, the food was delicious, but it's pricey for what you get and you don't have much space. TREAT YO SELF.  This place is worth the AMAZING food.  I was in Montreal for a total of 24 hrs & this place was recommended to me by a friend.  I do not speak French.  At.  All.  The waiter was so patient with me & did his best to explain the specials of the day.  He ended up just simplifying the day's soup to "chicken noodle soup" & also recommended one of the sandwiches.  I felt so bad after.  The soup was amazinggggg it did not deserve to be simplified to a mere chicken noodle soup & for that I'm so sorry.  It was so good.  The sandwich was such a large portion & so great, I had half & saved the other half for later.  It's also located in old Montreal, which is such a great place to walk around & take in the old architecture.  Completely recommend!!I absolutely love this place.  I was there years ago but still remember how quaint and cozy and warming this place was.  The service was super friendly and the food was on par.  I'm planning on going back next year and this is my first stop when I go back. This place came highly recommended to me.  I was visiting Montreal for the first time, and I was told that this cafe had the best coffee and baked goods.  There was an off-hand mention of the "beautiful but ill-tempered" employees but I glossed over it.  MISTAKE. We arrived and were seated promptly.  Upon attempting to order, we discovered they were out of nearly everything we wanted.  It was around 11am, and they told us they were out of coffee and the first two sandwiches I tried to order.  I work as a waitress in a restaurant.  I understand that it is not the fault of the waiters that items run out.  However, the rude, irritated attitude of the waiter was uncalled for.  If your menu is only 10-12 items long and 2 of them are sold out, you should tell people before they survey the menu.  Or apologize for the inconvenience.  I tried to order a third sandwich modified without mushroom, which I was told was not possible.  I ended up ordering the vegan sandwich. The sandwich was excellent. That being said, the overall experience was so poor that I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  There are plenty of other restaurants in Montreal with exceptional food and good service. Popped in toward the end of their brunch and it was still pretty crowded, but we managed to snag a table for two by one of their cute little windows. The space is great.  Chalkboards with doodles and menu items cover the walls and the cute cafe by the entrance has some goodies for sale.  The space gets crowded quick but it's a lively atmosphere.  In the summer, there's no AC but thank the heavens this is a corner location and the open air windows let in a slight breeze. Once seated, our server informed us a lot of the menu items are done for the day since its the end of brunch but the options left sounded just as delightful.  I had the mixed salad with chicken and my boyfriend had the Cuban sandwich.  Both were SPECTACULAR.  Although it was a different take on a classic, this was probably the best Cuban I've ever tried.  The pesto mayo made this dish! The mixed salad sounds so simple but it was SO good, the toasted almonds and the chopped chicken gave this salad the kick it didn't even need.  I loved how light but tasty the dressing was.  I wanted to come back the next day to have the same meal again, even though I don't like visiting the same restaurant twice while on vacation.  It was that good. This place isn't overrated or as pretentious as it sounds or looks - go check it out!Looking for a good cup of coffee and pastry, my doorman recommended this place - and he was right, it is fantastic! The place is small and every table was full with a wait.  I just grabbed a late and croissant to go.  The late was made perfectly.  Oh, and the croissant. . . oh la la! It did remind me of Paris. I think I definitely worked this place up in my head by reading all the reviews and then was a bit disappointed.  Don't get me wrong the food is good and the quality of the ingredients is great.  But is it worth the price, the wait and sitting shoulder to shoulder cramped with other guests. . . probably not.  I've been here twice.  Once for take out and once for a sit down meal.  For take out I ordered the banana chocolate brioche and a cappuccino.  It was good.  The pastry was delicious.  However I think the tiny cappuccinos are quite overpriced and nothing special.  For the sit down meal I got there at 10:40 am and it wasn't too busy.  I tried to order the 'in your face egg panini' which they were sold out of.  How do you sell out of eggs and bread at a breakfast place by 10:40? It wasn't a big deal, but it made a difference since their menu is already very small and limited.  I also noticed it's a trend in the other reviews.  Anyways I ordered the ricotta with honey and bread and an almond croissant.  Both were delicious.  The ricotta is creamy and refreshing.  The almond croissant is good but overpriced in my opinion.  I do have to say that the service there was lovely.  Everything was delivered quickly and with a smile.  However overall I think this place is a bit overrated.  Would I go here for lunch once in a while if I worked nearby, sure.  Would I go out of my way to come here? Probably not.  There are so many other cafes in this area with incredible cappuccinos and pastries at almost half the cost and half the crowds. The best cuban sandwich in Montreal according to me.  And the best in North America, according to Anthony Bourdain. In fact, all sandwiches are pretty awesome.  But how to resist O+G's sandwich filled with gooey gruyère, ham, pork loin and their secret sauce? Feeling a bit more healthy? The "24" salad with asian flavors is a good choice too. And how to resist their beautiful selection of baked desserts?Did I say how I love O+G ? Try it, you won't be disappointed. This place gets 5 stars from me, at least from the breakfast standpoint.  We came here because it was a highly recommended spot located in Old Montreal, and we wanted to try it out.  For breakfast I had a coffee, and the granola.  The granola is amazing it comes with yoghurt and a bunch of different types of fruit.  It was delicious.  I also had a chocolate and banana pastry which was super yummy as well. This place is very busy but we were seated and served pretty quickly.  I really liked this place and would totally come here again. Came here on Saturday for lunch around 12pm.  The host told us it would be a 25-30 minute wait, but when we came back around 12:30pm, he told us another 25 minutes, so that was pretty annoying that the estimated timing was wayyy off, but we got coffee at a nearby café so that was fine.  They also serve coffee and pastries in the takeout line, so that's nice to have while you wait. The place itself is very cozy and cute.  We sat on a communal table and I ordered a Goat Cheese and Onion Panini and a raspberry lemonade.  The Panini came with a homemade ketchup which was thinned out ketchup that was sweet but still tangy - it complemented the sandwich perfectly.  I couldn't finish the whole Panini by myself.  My friends ordered the Cuban sandwich and the Cajun Chicken Sandwich, which they all enjoyed.  Great to share the Paninis with friends for some variation in your overall meal.  I was sad to hear that they ran out of the egg in your face Panini -- I really wanted to try that!The service was pretty quick as all the sandwiches were premade, which I thought it was odd, considering sandwiches are pretty quick to make, but I was happy with our overall meal. Located in Old Montreal but was a really good restaurant!! I came there twice because the Cuba panini was only on lunch menu.  It deserves visiting again. My friend and I had two divine brioches for breakfast.  My chocolate and banana one was the best of the world! Too much chocolate inside! Not too sweet but very crispy.  Soooo nice~ The Cuba panini was crunchy outside and gooey inside.  Melting cheese with bacon and salty turkey, never forgot.  Because it was the last meal in Montreal. The staff were all very pretty and friendly.  Love the ambience and decoration of the restaurant.  The price was reasonable. From the ratings to the many reviews on here, it's as good as it gets so I won't repeat the others, but a few of my own tips and observations:Let me preface that I was just visiting Montreal for the weekend, first time in the city. I came here essentially to get that Eggs In Yo Face (I'm sure you know what I mean) breakfast sandwich.   Note: The place currently opens at 9 am (on Saturdays).   From reading blogs, it suggested we get there at 8:30, we arrived at 8:40 to a closed restaurant.  We walked around and came back at 9:04 and already there was a line.  Luckily we managed to snag some seats at the high table though so definitely come early, this place is as popular as they say! I asked if I could get the sandwich without cheese - DENIED.   Said the cheese was already pre-mixed into the eggs.   I decided to chance it.  I've hated cheese my entire life, I've become quite adept at picking out cheese from food.   And glad I did, because all I had to do was open the sandwich and not eat the side on which the cheese was melted.  The rest was delicious and cheese free (uhm. . . but this also means the cheese could have easily been left out but. . . . whatever).   I asked for a knife and fork from a passing waitress (crucial tools in my cheese extraction). . . who reluctantly gave them to me with this request: "please be careful of the plates when  using the knife and fork, the plates scratch easily and can also break if you press too hard" - uhm.  really? I need to be careful of breaking plates. . . . . at a restaurant. . . . . with my utensils?  Sounds like someone bought some useless plates.  They were very pretty though. So why 5 stars for a place that refused me to go cheeseless and warns you of heavy utensil use? Cuz the food is delicious! Really, go and get the sandwich.  I miss it already.  Also the vibe is great.  Lovely cozy spot perfect for breakfast to fuel you up for a day of sightseeing.  Also, our main server (male) was great, super nice and friendly and overall we had a great meal.  Approx $70 Canadian (including tip) for 2 sandwiches, 1 fruit bowl, 1 pastry, 2 coffees and 2 very fresh squeezed orange juice for a party of 3. Olive & Gourmando is located in Old Montreal on Saint Paul.  It is just a couple of blocks off of the river near the old port. As other yelpers have written the place does a brisk business, mainly with the tourist trade.  However, Olive & Gourmand is a pretty good place for fresh baked goods, good coffee and an excellent brunch.  We had about a 20-minute wait for our table for 3. The food we had was all very fresh and had nice flavors.  I had the Goat Cheese Sandwich (Mild goat cheese paillot and caramelized onions.  Served with their house made ketchup) and it was excellent.  We also had coffee and some really special baked goods. The prices are not too bad either being in the heart of the tourist district.  Our server was really nice also. Every time I set foot in here for breakfast (or lunch), I'm always pleased with the food quality, the excellent & friend service and the eclectic and welcoming decor!You'll often hear patrons of Olive & Gourmand complimenting them on the "concept". . .  interesting because when you ask veteran Marie-Helene and Sandra, or "old crusts" as they jokingly call themselves, there is no concept.  It's just the result  of a slow evolution of bringing goodness and joy to people, season after season. The hustle and bustle can perhaps turn off some people who prefer quietness when sipping their café but if you're like me and love the vibe, the energy, the possibility of striking serendipitous conversations with locals or out-of-towners, and the soothing humming of the hustle & bustle this iconic place delivers then you're in for happy times!Whether you're vegan, vegetarian, or a carnivore (me), Olive & Gourmando redefines what wholesome, homemade food should be.
